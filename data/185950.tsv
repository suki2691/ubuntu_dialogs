2006-06-24T10:23:00.000Z	Josh43		Ok, I have a question about a semi-exotic setup, and I'm hoping that there is a howto somewhere; I have xgl running, but I want a second session running with the regular xorg that I can log into via vnc on the local machine
2006-06-24T10:24:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA	Josh43	"semi"?
2006-06-24T10:25:00.000Z	Josh43	ToHellWithGA	Lol - granted.. my point is that it seems (to me), to be a logical solution to vnc-ing to an xgl machine
2006-06-24T10:26:00.000Z	Josh43	ToHellWithGA	THe problem is that it doesn't caputre what is put to the screen; it captures the driver output before it's seen on the screen.. it freaks on xgl
