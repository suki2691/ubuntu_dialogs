2012-05-22T13:29:00.000Z	TBarth	DarwinSurvivor	how can I exclude a kernel update when using the command "aptitude safe-upgrade"
2012-05-22T13:30:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	TBarth	I don't use the GUI updater, but I believe there is a simple checkbox. alternatively, you can install the new kernel and just not reboot, the old kernel will be left in until then
