2012-04-23T17:51:00.000Z	APoulos	blackbear008	trying to run rsync to dupe my home directory w/ the exception of my videos folder
2012-04-23T17:52:00.000Z	APoulos	blackbear008	this is what I've been able to do: rsync --progress -rEog --exclude $HOME/Videos/ /home/alex /media/backup/12.04-Precise-backup_4.23.2012/
2012-04-23T17:53:00.000Z	APoulos	blackbear008	ive tried the other ones like /home/alex/Videos/ and ~/Videos/
