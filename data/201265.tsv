2007-09-13T09:13:00.000Z	ikonia		shooters find -mtime
2007-09-13T09:15:00.000Z	shooters	ikonia	-mtime "n", but isn't there a way to enter the date directly, rather than convert it in days?
2007-09-13T09:16:00.000Z	shooters	ikonia	and what's the command to tell the numbers of days between two dates?
2007-09-13T09:17:00.000Z	shooters	ikonia	I need to do it in a script...
