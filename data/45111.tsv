2009-10-24T07:43:00.000Z	emja		I installed Jaunty a week ago and found it to be very sluggish compared to Hardy (which I've got on the same machine - dual boot). I've had the same problem with Intrepid. I'm only running xfce without compiz. Can anyone advise me on what could be slowing my system down?
2009-10-24T07:44:00.000Z	Taenon	emja	weren't there intel chipset regressions in 9.04?
2009-10-24T07:45:00.000Z	emja	Taenon	no idea, but I am running an intel video chipset
2009-10-24T07:45:00.000Z	emja	Taenon	can you cite a source for that?
