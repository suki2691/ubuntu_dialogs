2006-07-14T12:53:00.000Z	_smd_		I got a new ISP today I can connect in windows but not in ubuntu.  What do i have to change? I went from dsl to broadband.
2006-07-14T12:53:00.000Z	Warbo	_smd_	Do you have an ethernet router or a USB modem?
2006-07-14T12:55:00.000Z	Warbo	_smd_	Go into System>Administration>Networking and look for your Ethernet device. Set it to DHCP mode and activate it, and make sure it is the default gateway
2006-07-14T12:56:00.000Z	_smd_	Warbo	i will try that tomorrow when i get back from work thanks.
