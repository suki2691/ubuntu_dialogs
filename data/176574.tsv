2008-11-15T01:52:00.000Z	glase-noise		No-no just 4 desktops, and there is no option by right clicking on the desktop (ubuntu-studio)
2008-11-15T01:53:00.000Z	hwilde	glase-noise	you have to right click on the desktop switcher in the panel
2008-11-15T01:53:00.000Z	hwilde	glase-noise	right click, preferences,  number of workspaces : 4
