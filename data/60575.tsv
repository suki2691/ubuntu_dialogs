2009-04-10T00:20:00.000Z	Skaperen	Pici	BTDT ... stuff doesn't all work ... apparently some "hard coded" bindings interfere or take priority
2009-04-10T00:21:00.000Z	Pici	Skaperen	You could try asking in #irssi too
2009-04-10T00:21:00.000Z	Skaperen	Pici	also, I've got it all coded into the scripts/config ... so I can run multiple instances refreshed from the original state (so state saves during running do NOT, by intent, make permanent changes)
