2006-08-30T09:17:00.000Z	Ricesteam		what is the difference between i386 vs i686?
2006-08-30T09:18:00.000Z	Ricesteam		would there be noticable differences if I update to i686 from i386 since I'm using a P4?
2006-08-30T09:18:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	Ricesteam	should be, its worth it to upgrade
2006-08-30T09:21:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	Ricesteam	thats usually fine. i've found that upgrading is really only beneficial if you have hyperthreaded or dual core processors
