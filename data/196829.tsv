2009-03-07T13:01:00.000Z	titon		hi i'm having some problem with hardy heron. i went back from intrepid cuz i had problems with the 96 drivers. The nvidia driver works great when it first was installed...i had compiz fusion with all the effects running good. but after reboot i get some vertical lines going across the splash screen and gdm is all flickering lines going across and i cant see the anything but that. its a geforce 4 go 440 with 96.43.05 drivers
2009-03-07T13:02:00.000Z	titon		it works if i change to nv.....reboots...login......change to nvidia and shutdown computer and then boot it up. then the nvidia works but only once....and then it repeats it self
2009-03-07T13:03:00.000Z	titon		anyone heard of this nvidia problem?
