2009-09-24T04:27:00.000Z	Blankman		I can use puppy linux, but it would be nice if there was an ubuntu that runs out of ram.
2009-09-24T04:28:00.000Z	timbojimbo	Blankman	you know you can run a live disk right?
2009-09-24T04:28:00.000Z	Blankman	timbojimbo	yep, but that does not run 100% out of ram.  if there is a hard drive it mounts.
