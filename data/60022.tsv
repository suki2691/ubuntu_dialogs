2009-07-04T04:32:00.000Z	dto		hi. is there a standalone program that will bring up the ubuntu applications menus? i use awesomewm and would still like to browse what's installed
2009-07-04T04:33:00.000Z	CloudCarrier	dto	System->Preferences->Main Menu
2009-07-04T04:33:00.000Z	dto	CloudCarrier	but i'm not in Gnome. there is no System->Preferences to click.
2009-07-04T04:33:00.000Z	dto	CloudCarrier	maybe i need to upgrade.
