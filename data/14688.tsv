2011-05-04T09:41:00.000Z	Diverdude		To this day i still do not understand why the clipboard in ubuntu has not been fixed yet. When i copy something from a program or window or whatever it goes to the clipboard-> good. But when i close the program or window....my copy is ALSO deleted from the clipboard...this is something which should have been fixed in alpha version 0.0.1.....but in ubuntu 11.04 it still exists. I am baffled!
