2004-11-25T15:00:00.000Z	epod	bkw-laptop	depends if you want to install it to hard disk (which could overwrite your OS you already have installed if you don't know what you're doing)
2004-11-25T15:01:00.000Z	bkw-laptop	epod	I'll remove everything currently installed so it doesnt matter. which one will be the best choice for me then?
2004-11-25T15:02:00.000Z	epod	bkw-laptop	running from a livecd is always slower, and doesn't let you really change much, so I'd recommend just grabbing the i386 iso
