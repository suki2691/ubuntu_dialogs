2006-06-21T13:48:00.000Z	Agrajag		oh, I guess it's LGPL now, I don't think thats always been the case
2006-06-21T13:49:00.000Z	Agrajag		not really, because when you link to lgpl code, you don't have to make that code LGPL as well, that's why it's the lesser gpl
2006-06-21T13:50:00.000Z	cwillu	Agrajag	got it backwards;  lgpl lets you make modules that other code includes;  they're writing modules that wine ends up including
