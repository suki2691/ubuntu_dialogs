2010-04-08T00:28:00.000Z	alonea	progre55	missing codecs maybe? is all the ffmpeg stuff installed?
2010-04-08T00:31:00.000Z	progre55	alonea	it was not installed
2010-04-08T00:33:00.000Z	alonea	progre55	try that. I generally don't want a lot of videos on my nix machine, but codecs tend to be an issue. What kind of file is it? and check if itsd silenced of course
