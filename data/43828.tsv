2009-11-03T05:05:00.000Z	FrozEEEn		i'm working on installing ubuntu to an old mandriva box i run and am working on partitions - can i take an ext3 partition and make it ext4 without formatting it?
2009-11-03T05:07:00.000Z	FrozEEEn		does the installe convert it when i choose ext4?
2009-11-03T05:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	FrozEEEn	sort of.. all new files will be in ext4 and the older ones in ext3
2009-11-03T05:10:00.000Z	FrozEEEn	Scunizi	is there any disadvantage to just mounting a 3 as a 4? or am i better off formatting it to make it a 4?
