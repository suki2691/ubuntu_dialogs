2011-10-20T01:04:00.000Z	blsh0p		you guys know how in ubuntu 11.04, whenever you plugged in a flashdrive or harddrive, an icon appeared in the desktop? How do you get that back in ubuntu 11.10?
2011-10-20T01:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	blsh0p	it should add an icon to the unity bar (assuming you use unity)
2011-10-20T02:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	blsh0p	it will add an item in nautilus you can use in the meantime
