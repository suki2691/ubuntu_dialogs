2006-12-16T06:34:00.000Z	kitche	PhibreOptix	you have to finish the cd it will fit but you have to close it after burning
2006-12-16T06:35:00.000Z	PhibreOptix	kitche	So, he has to close the open sessions on it?
2006-12-16T06:36:00.000Z	kitche	PhibreOptix	yes it should say something like finish when that screen pops up there should be cancel and yes just click ont he one that's on the left side of that window that pops up
