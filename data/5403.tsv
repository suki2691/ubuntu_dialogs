2012-07-11T16:38:00.000Z	kurtwp_	Siobhan000	I was used to gnome also but I just jump in and did a fresh install of 12.04 and using unity 2d
2012-07-11T16:38:00.000Z	kurtwp_	Siobhan000	to it is fine and don't really care about all the different customization you can do to desktops
2012-07-11T16:40:00.000Z	kurtwp_	Siobhan000	Just one suggestion - do a fresh install of 12.04 - I upgraded from 11.10 and it hosed up my whole system
