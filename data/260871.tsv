2005-04-14T11:50:00.000Z	awb4422		i'm using hoary, and obviously evolution 2.2. Every single time I check my email, I get a warning about a certificate. This has never happened in any previous email client, along with several versions of evolution. Is there anything I can do to get rid of the warning?
