2010-03-24T06:21:00.000Z	hacked		I have a question: what if you boot from a USB but you don't have internet access and therefore can't get the driver to get internet?
2010-03-24T06:22:00.000Z	Xial	hacked	the only time I ever needed to be able to get online for a driver was for some oddball unsupported wlan adapter, but the NIC still worked. In my case, I plugged in a cable. Kept going.
