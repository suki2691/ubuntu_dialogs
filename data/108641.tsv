2009-08-25T00:47:00.000Z	intel352		hey all, i'm trying to configure "twinview" style functionality on an ubuntu 9 machine that has an ATI vid card, and a USB2VGA dongle (2 monitor setup, #1 running on the ATI onboard, #2 running on the dongle using sisusb driver)
2009-08-25T00:47:00.000Z	intel352		if I enable xinerama, X fails while trying to enable nvidia for some reason (which is a PCI card I have installed during my experiments trying to get dual-monitors working), if I disable xinerama, I get 2 working displays without the ability to drag windows across displays...  (using the dongle & onboard ATI)
2009-08-25T00:47:00.000Z	intel352		thoughts?
