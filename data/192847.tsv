2006-04-02T09:09:00.000Z	CreatureOfLegend		Hello. It's me again. Question: does the command: apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-2.6.12-9-386 make the computer connect to the internet to install the headers thing?
2006-04-02T09:09:00.000Z	neo911	CreatureOfLegend	it's not headers thing... it's headers thingy
2006-04-02T09:10:00.000Z	CreatureOfLegend		Ok ^_^ headers thingy
2006-04-02T09:11:00.000Z	CreatureOfLegend	neo911	because I've got a whole bunch of errors that says no such file or directory and list URLs like http://security.ubuntu.com or us.archive.ubuntu.com
