2010-07-21T03:42:00.000Z	Hopsa	nforced	We need to somehow make sure that ATI and Nvidia can work nicely. Their cards are semi short lived and they are based off of the same chips so it shouldnt be extremely hard. Im guessing we will have better 3D drivers then windows in 1-2 years time. If we havnt im gonna go evil on thise chip makers whith the knowhow i have about them.
