2012-08-09T23:22:00.000Z	soliloquy		The last time I used Ubuntu, we were back at Gnome 2.0…. now there's Unity and Gnome Shell and god knows-what. I theme quite heavily and have always used Compiz when I was using Linux & build my own GTK themes… Anyone care to talk to me about my options now that Gnome 3 isn't friends w/ compiz?
