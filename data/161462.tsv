2006-11-02T15:05:00.000Z	luciddream		I just started playing with screen and realized I had inadvertently created a bunch of sessions without knowing what I was doing.  I then figured I'd wipe them out by doing "rm /var/run/screen/S-adam/*" which I'm now realizing was maybe not so smart.  Apparently the sessions are still "alive" but I can't reattach to them now -- any advice?
