2010-10-08T16:56:00.000Z	OneMillionDollar		do i need to install a webserver if i want to learn php pgramming ?
2010-10-08T16:56:00.000Z	c3l	OneMillionDollar	not really, but php is basically only used for server scripting for websites/webapps
2010-10-08T16:57:00.000Z	c3l	OneMillionDollar	so having a webserver to test it on would be recommended I guess
