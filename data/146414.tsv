2011-12-13T23:28:00.000Z	Mgamerz		If I do grub-install of a 10.04 disk and try to write it to a external USB drive, will I be able to select 'boot to USB' in my bios (it supports it) and then use grub to boot ubuntu?
2011-12-13T23:28:00.000Z	Mgamerz		I'd use super grub2 disk but I don't have any flash drives that are small and unused, and for some reason my laptop hates booting linux from CD (but it works with windows fine)
2011-12-13T23:29:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Mgamerz	have you considered the alternate cd install ?
2011-12-13T23:32:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Mgamerz	well, rather than install on an outboard to avoid using a cdrom , why not try the alternate ?
