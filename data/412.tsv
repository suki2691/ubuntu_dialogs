2012-11-14T17:29:00.000Z	devswap		actionparsnip: I realise that but if they want ubuntuone to take off then shouldnt it compete equally if not be cheaper? I dont know for certain but I suspect that dropbox has better functionality also

2012-11-14T17:32:00.000Z	devswap	belgianguy	yes and hence I think it should be cheaper not more expensive
