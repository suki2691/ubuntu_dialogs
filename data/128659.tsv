2007-07-14T15:28:00.000Z	bullgard4		My computer contains 40 files with 'hwmon' in its name but a kernel module 'hwmon' is not loaded. Can one explain to me the concept of 'hwmon'?
2007-07-14T15:29:00.000Z	skollie	bullgard4	have you googled hwmon?
2007-07-14T15:29:00.000Z	bullgard4	skollie	Yes. And can you answer my question?
2007-07-14T15:29:00.000Z	skollie	bullgard4	no, that's why I asked if you googled it
