2007-03-02T15:45:00.000Z	tezem		hi, sometimes when I boot my machine I get a message that a process with pid 1418 or similar could not be killed and the boot process will hang. This happens on two totally different machines, any idea what the problem might be?

2007-03-02T15:46:00.000Z	eck		it will probably be logged to syslog
2007-03-02T15:47:00.000Z	tezem	eck	I already checked my logs including syslog but nothing about that message
