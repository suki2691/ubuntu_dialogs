2009-07-31T06:18:00.000Z	StupidWeasel		Hey folks - quick question, how would I stop my touchpad scroll (aka mouse middle scroll button) switching window focus?
2009-07-31T06:18:00.000Z	WeblionX	StupidWeasel	You mean when you click on it?
2009-07-31T06:20:00.000Z	WeblionX	StupidWeasel	Well, you can just keep the mouse away from the window bar, but I think there's an option, let me see...
2009-07-31T06:27:00.000Z	WeblionX	StupidWeasel	Yeah, I can't find any options.  I don't think GNOME has one.
