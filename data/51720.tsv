2009-07-29T03:27:00.000Z	desperdo		HELP PLEASE :)  when typing in terminal gstreamer-properties,  what file does it edit ?
2009-07-29T03:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	desperdo	i think it stores that on gconf not in any file
2009-07-29T03:30:00.000Z	desperdo	erUSUL	 so where can I restore the properties to their original state ?
2009-07-29T03:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	desperdo	i do not find anything relevant in gconf-editor... so maybe is not gconf...
