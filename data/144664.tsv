2007-06-05T15:52:00.000Z	bionoid		I've had my Feisty running quite well since I installed it - but I have one problem that I'm unsure how to solve. I have an Intel 945GM graphics adapter, but the drivers have _extremely_ poor 3D performance. For example Google Earth is completely unusable, need at least 30 minutes to complete the 2-second start animation. Anyone have an idea what might cause this?
