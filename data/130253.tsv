2007-07-24T07:59:00.000Z	HoboBen		Hey everyone - is there a quick way I can make it so that one user in a multi-user environment cannot use nautilus to move beyond their own home directory?
2007-07-24T08:01:00.000Z	HoboBen		thanks, jcs - thought of that, and yeah, it might do, but doesn't that leave all the other system folders open too? If there's no quick way, your way would do though
2007-07-24T08:02:00.000Z	SirBob1701	HoboBen	could write a script to chmod em all fast :)
2007-07-24T08:02:00.000Z	HoboBen	SirBob1701	that might be the best way. I'll do that. Thanks.
