2010-04-02T02:00:00.000Z	deegen		I'd like to have a does-everything panel on the bottom, in a similar style to Windows (sorry). I've deleted the top panel and added everything I want to the bottom. However, now, if I right click a program from the and select "Add this launcher to panel" it hides the list of running programs. Is there any way to fix this?
