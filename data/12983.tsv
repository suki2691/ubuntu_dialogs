2011-06-24T23:06:00.000Z	blip99		Hi, I've been trying to set up NVidia driver on my laptop for several days.  I just added the PPA http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates/ubuntu  and I installed nvidia-current and nvidia-settings, and restarted and also selected/activated the driver from the "Additional Drivers" tool.  but it doesn't work
2011-06-24T23:06:00.000Z	blip99		nvidia-xconfig isn't even installed... how can that be ??
2011-06-24T23:06:00.000Z	blip99		it should be inside the nvidia-current package
2011-06-24T23:07:00.000Z	nophone	blip99	maybe there's an apt-get for the driver you need?
