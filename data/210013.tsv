2006-12-04T17:02:00.000Z	LjL	WilderSon	enable universe, and "sudo apt-get install vdr-dev"
2006-12-04T17:03:00.000Z	WilderSon	Windy	tried with synaptics .. i thought it was the same
2006-12-04T17:03:00.000Z	LjL	WilderSon	Synaptic. Synaptics is a kind of touchpad. anyway, yeah, you can use whatever.
