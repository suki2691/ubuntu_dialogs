2004-11-14T15:23:00.000Z	|trey|	rfetech	On Debian based systems, rl 2-5 are the same... you would simple set /etc/X11/default-desktop-manager to "NONE"
2004-11-14T15:23:00.000Z	|trey|	rfetech	so 'echo NONE > /etc/X11/default-desktop-manager'
2004-11-14T15:25:00.000Z	|trey|	rfetech	you're welcome... also investigate rcconf for simular tasks, nice ncurses interface for editing services  :)
