2008-12-11T05:28:00.000Z	unop	CaMason_	you can set a umask value - but that affects all files created, not just those in a specific folder
2008-12-11T05:29:00.000Z	unop	CaMason_	for files that already exist - you can use chmod again
2008-12-11T05:30:00.000Z	CaMason_	unop	ok, thanks. I'll just hack this script
