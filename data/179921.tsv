2006-09-26T10:54:00.000Z	dpm		I've got a weird "error" with Evolution 2.8 in Edgy. If I launch it from the applications menu ('evolution --component=mail'), it works fine. However, if I start it from a keyboard shortcut defined under System>Preferences>Keyboart Shortcuts>Email, it does not seem to communicate with the gnome-keyring daemon, since it asks me for the password of each and every account upon startup. Any ideas what this could be?
