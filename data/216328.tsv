2005-10-02T10:16:00.000Z	linuxmonkey		i just wished that my wifi card worked in native mode without having to use ndiswrapper.. it worked in Fedora Core 3 when I tested it out but when i compile the driver modules and try to insert them i get a module format error, yet the module is 2.6.X..lol

2005-10-02T10:26:00.000Z	Blissex	linuxmonkey	then perhaps it is possible but not supported. I am surprised though.
