2010-10-09T20:29:00.000Z	sdmadmin		I want to clone an ubuntu instllation over the network to multiple machines which have same hardware
2010-10-09T20:31:00.000Z	sdmadmin		i tried using clonezilla with drbl server, but while i tried booting the client over pxe, i got tftp timeout
2010-10-09T20:33:00.000Z	sdmadmin		i have to install on more than 80 machines so dd image is going to be too cumbersome
2010-10-09T20:34:00.000Z	Ken8521	sdmadmin	i've not looked at clonezilla's live CD options, but maybe it has a network drive option?
