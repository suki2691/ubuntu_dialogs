2010-05-06T01:33:00.000Z	tom_fishy		Hi, I just installed ubuntu as a guest OS with Vbox. I then installed the guest additions and it worked fine. I could maximize the screen, move the mouse without taping the host control and so on. Then I installed a few apps with synaptic that said that ubuntu must be restarted so I did that. But after that it was like my guest addionts isn't installed anymore. All I did was unmount it and...
2010-05-06T01:33:00.000Z	tom_fishy		...removed it as a "disc from vbox". Can't I un-mount it after I have installed it?
2010-05-06T01:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tom_fishy	i'd ask in #vbox
2010-05-06T01:34:00.000Z	tom_fishy	ActionParsnip	ok thanks
