2008-02-09T17:31:00.000Z	Hechicera1973		i enabled 4 desktops; but can't set differents backgrounds on them. I change one... the others change the same. Another thing; can't enable the 3d cube. I went to the Advanced desktop settings and mark it, but the best i can do is switch between desktops (you can see the animated rotation) but no a 3d cube. I will appreciate any help.
