2006-10-28T08:38:00.000Z	blind	gharz	command line or gui or does it not matter?
2006-10-28T08:38:00.000Z	gharz	blind	gui would be better
2006-10-28T08:39:00.000Z	blind	gharz	the only one i know of is tovid, but that's command line. it's what i use, it's really simple. something to fall back on if you can't find a gui one.
