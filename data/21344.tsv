2012-07-08T17:59:00.000Z	compdoc	ari-santihiyu	qemu is a virtual machine. wine emulates windows
2012-07-08T18:03:00.000Z	compdoc	ari-santihiyu	qemu is great for running a server that doesnt need fast screen display, like for games. ANd for running the wndows VM automatically each time you boot Ubuntu. Depends what you want to do, but if you want fast video, even for programs like Adobe Illustrator, use Virtualbox
2012-07-08T18:06:00.000Z	compdoc	ari-santihiyu	virtualbox can do most everything, and its faster, but it isnt really meant to run an OS as a server 24/7
