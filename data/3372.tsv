2012-10-25T04:39:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	RedAmber2	Have you checked th md5sum of the disc or ISO?
2012-10-25T04:42:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	RedAmber2	here is a good link for doing this.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM  There is also a out of the bios boot from menu, sometime that is all that is needed, mine is reached with a f12 at powering on yous may be different.
