2006-11-10T14:24:00.000Z	ladydoor		so i'm getting this error on starting emacs:  error: "Font `miscfixed' is not defined" . This is only when i'm using it non-tty (in an X-Window), and is an improvement on meaningless squares (which is what i got before setting the font to miscfixed). anyone know how to make this go away? i know miscfixed/MiscFixed exists, as it's my xterm font
