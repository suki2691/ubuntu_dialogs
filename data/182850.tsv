2008-03-07T04:00:00.000Z	_ba		when i do apt get and upgrade says 0 upgraded and 0 installed
2008-03-07T04:00:00.000Z	_ba		it looks like when tryin apt get its looking for the cdrom how do i point it to the inet?
2008-03-07T04:01:00.000Z	Pelo	_ba	that means there were 0 upgrades available and so 0 new packages were installed
