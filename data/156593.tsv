2007-10-05T07:56:00.000Z	grjemo		I am trying to boot the Ubuntu .iso on my windows sp2 computer, but when I turn it on it just says, "missing operating system". What do I do?
2007-10-05T07:57:00.000Z	riotkittie	grjemo	and you've set it to boot from the CD?  do you have multiple disc drives?
2007-10-05T07:59:00.000Z	riotkittie	grjemo	did you check the md5sum?
2007-10-05T08:02:00.000Z	riotkittie	grjemo	i'd check the md5 and make sue taht it matches, but i forget what you nood to install to do that under Windows. alternately you may want to try burning to another disc, but perhaps someone in here has a better idea
