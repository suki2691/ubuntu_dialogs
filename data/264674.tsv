2005-11-06T13:05:00.000Z	ColD_7		i need some help on installing yamaha ymf719e-s sound card on ubuntu
2005-11-06T13:06:00.000Z	deFrysk	ColD_7	if the soundcard is supported ubuntu will auto-detect it
2005-11-06T13:07:00.000Z	deFrysk	ColD_7	and if you are switching from an onboard card to another card just make sure to disable the build-in soundcard in your bios
2005-11-06T13:08:00.000Z	deFrysk	ColD_7	good luck wit turning onboard sound off :)
