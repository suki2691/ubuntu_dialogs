2011-02-05T09:01:00.000Z	rewineland		yes but i am looking for easy setup
2011-02-05T09:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	rewineland	nothing much easier than apt-get install openssh-server
2011-02-05T09:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	rewineland	well you said you wanted something that needed no account, so maybe ssh wouldn't be as easy for that
