2010-05-06T05:13:00.000Z	woodyjlw		I do not want to dual boot but I have three 250 gig hard drives, one is sata and two are ide, if I unplug the windows 7 on the sata and install ubuntu on the ide and tell the bios to boot from sata first I could still F8 and pick the ide ubuntu to boot to that one when I want to right???

2010-05-06T05:15:00.000Z	genii	woodyjlw	Unplugging a drive re-arranges the order the bios reports them for instance
2010-05-06T05:15:00.000Z	woodyjlw	genii	I know . I would have to reconfigure bios when done
