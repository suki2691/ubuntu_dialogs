2005-10-12T11:51:00.000Z	dima2001	TiMiDo	well, apm is not quite what i needed. my battery is going low too fast - although it should work at least 2.5 hours (up to 4.7), it is alreqdy empty at ~1:40. it is a toshiba m50 satellite and I think that I have to avate something to spare some energy. the notebook an the accu are 24 hours old ...
