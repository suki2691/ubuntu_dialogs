In fact, all the ./configures I've run have thrown weird errors, usually about gcc or g++. What's going on?
2005-04-27T12:36:00.000Z	Obsidians		Thanx, everyone! I'll try all those.
2005-04-27T12:38:00.000Z	Obsidians		If Synaptic crashes, how do I allow apt-get to work? It says that it's locked, but I'm not sure what to unlock, or how to do it.
