2007-06-23T10:19:00.000Z	megafauna		HI. Can someone recommend a decent file backup utility that can copy directories which only replaces the files which have been altered and leaves the unaltered ones? I had one in windoze but not now
2007-06-23T10:20:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	megafauna	try Konserve?
2007-06-23T10:22:00.000Z	megafauna	PF|Ubuntu	thanks, i will look that up too
2007-06-23T10:41:00.000Z	megafauna	PF|Ubuntu	konserve looks good. If I can get it write over files which have been altered while ignoring the rest I will have won. I really like that it is automatic, even windoze didn't have that.
