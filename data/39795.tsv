2009-12-31T20:09:00.000Z	MoonShadow		Hi, Can anyone help me: I installed Ubuntu 9.04 Server, but the machine always freezes about 1 minute after login. Sometime I get "unable to handle kernel paging request...". Googling this only yields pages relevant to self-compiled kernels
2009-12-31T20:09:00.000Z	MoonShadow		I'm at a complete loss...
