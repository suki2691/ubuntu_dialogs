2009-02-18T12:31:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	lvty	I do not know if that is your attempt at humor, or just plain bad advice, but I do not appreciate it. Thanks.
2009-02-18T12:33:00.000Z	lvty		Well, I had issues with audio and wireless cards in Intrepid, it's not user error when the previous version worked (i.e. a regression)
2009-02-18T12:34:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	lvty	yeah but this is support for intrepid not hardy, also, i had issues with audio too but it turns out its just a package that needed to be upgraded that wasn't...
