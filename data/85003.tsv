2008-07-22T07:04:00.000Z	NeedEpsonHelp		Hello, I just bought an epson cx7450 all in one printer. I've read somewhere that someone installed it in Ubuntu 7.10 and the printer was found immediately. Can anyone tell me whether this printer will work in Ubuntu 8.04.1 and if so how would I go about getting it to function
