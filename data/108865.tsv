2009-11-02T17:22:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		I have no graphics after I assume X starts. I backed up all partitions from hardy before deleting and doing a clean install of karmic. After install the graphics were borked. I googled and found someone else who had solved the problem by sudo apt-get remove compiz-core (I am running an old machine). That worked and I had a single screen working on my matrox twin head graphics card. Then I copied my old xorg.conf into /etc/X11 to get the twin scree

So I deleted xorg.conf again and now I get no graphics at all after the grub2 ubuntu logo disappears. I have tried disabling the matrox card in the bios and using the onboard graphics adapter but that makes no difference. My brain is close to exploding as this is so frustrating and confusing. Help please before I go insane and just reinstall hard
