2009-01-18T04:25:00.000Z	ziggles	Bizzeh	this router has been undergoing a lot of changes... i just bridged it with another router today and maybe that has something to do with it
2009-01-18T04:26:00.000Z	ziggles	Bizzeh	it's just a little personal dlink... nothing special
2009-01-18T04:26:00.000Z	Bizzeh	ziggles	i have a Â£70 dlink as my router
