2011-05-01T23:28:00.000Z	ThinkT510	a111	it works fine for me, but that doesn't help you now does it?
2011-05-01T23:29:00.000Z	a111	ThinkT510	Nope. Windows 7 cannot read the disk at all. I htink im going to have to reinstall ubuntu to copy the  data off the disk.
2011-05-01T23:30:00.000Z	ThinkT510	a111	you could do that with a livecd, no need to reinstall
