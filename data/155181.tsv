2007-04-05T13:57:00.000Z	Andrew250		Hello, I have a very noob question as I'm new to Linux and I'm in the process of choosing a distro.  I'm currently comparing Ubuntu and OpenSuSe so if any one has any comments on that I would be thankful.  But my Linux question is if I'm using a Linux OS can it read files on a second HD that is NTFS formated?
