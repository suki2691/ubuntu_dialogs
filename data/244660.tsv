2005-07-03T13:56:00.000Z	djp	LeaChim	do you have gstreamer0.8-dvd installed?
2005-07-03T13:57:00.000Z	LeaChim	djp	yes
2005-07-03T13:58:00.000Z	djp	LeaChim	do like Burgundavia said and install totem-xine. i myself don't use totem to watch dvd's although i beleive it is possible using totem-gstreamer, which i prefer to totem-xine
2005-07-03T14:01:00.000Z	djp	LeaChim	totem-xine should work fine. i know that i got that working a while back to playback dvd's...strange
