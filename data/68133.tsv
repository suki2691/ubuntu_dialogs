2009-09-04T04:53:00.000Z	Gouda1		How do I find out where miro installed to? It didn't create any icons or anything when I installed it
2009-09-04T04:54:00.000Z	linux	Gouda1	go to terminal and do a "find / -name miro" without the quotes
2009-09-04T04:55:00.000Z	linux	Gouda1	the file is solely "miro" without anything before or after
2009-09-04T04:56:00.000Z	linux	Gouda1	don't thank me, thanks Linux :)
