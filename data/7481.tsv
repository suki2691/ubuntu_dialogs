2012-02-22T00:11:00.000Z	Scott_S	zykotick9	Yes, but either one works. =P
2012-02-22T00:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	Scott_S	in order to use names to reconnect (you need to name them first, ctrl+a then shift+a) for example one of my screen sessions (listed with "screen -ls" is 3302.monitors, and i can use "screen -r monitors" to reconnect to it)
2012-02-22T00:28:00.000Z	Scott_S	zykotick9	I was under the impression that screens would name themselves based on the PID and the name of the process? At least, they usually do for me
