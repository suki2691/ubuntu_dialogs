2006-11-25T16:04:00.000Z	Morrissey		I have a kind of off topic question. In my laptop I have 2x256mb RAM, If I buy a 1gb RAM, can I use one slot for the 1gb ram, and the other for a 256 mb ram chip?

2006-11-25T16:07:00.000Z	trench-	Morrissey	max ram allowed
2006-11-25T16:08:00.000Z	Morrissey	trench-	ok, thanks .. so it is ok to have 1x1gb and 1x256? :)
