2009-11-13T03:49:00.000Z	annoia		I'm trying to convert aac to ac3 on the fly with mplayer, but it seems like libacv doesn't support ac3 encoding (lavcac3enc) (Not in mplayer at any rate). Can I fix this easily?
2009-11-13T03:50:00.000Z	laclasse	annoia	isn't aac 2 channels, and ac3 5? you need some software mixing there to 'create' 3 more channels from the audio, no ?
2009-11-13T03:50:00.000Z	annoia	laclasse	- AAC can be more channels.
2009-11-13T03:51:00.000Z	laclasse	annoia	ok
