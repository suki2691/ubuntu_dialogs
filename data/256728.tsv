2005-10-30T17:59:00.000Z	mike998		is there any way to make nautilus launch (for example when opening your home directory) to launch with the --no-desktop option?
2005-10-30T06:00:00.000Z	madsen	mike998	I think you can configure nautilus (in the prefs) not to handle the desktop at all...
2005-10-30T06:01:00.000Z	madsen	mike998	Yeah, they must have removed it from the prefs. (?)
2005-10-30T06:02:00.000Z	mike998	madsen	probably like the ability to have custom icons for your launchers
