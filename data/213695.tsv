2005-12-14T15:13:00.000Z	Torez04		According to Ubuntu, when I type "sudo etc/init.d/networking restart", "etc/init.d/networking" is command not found. Changing it around so it's "sudo restart etc/yadaryadar" says restart isn't a command. Shutdown -r to try and reboot the system says I have to be root. Is my Ubuntu bummed?
2005-12-14T15:15:00.000Z	Torez04		I am trying to restart my network! I'm having too many problems with wireless, seemingly like a few other people in here! I just want to restart my networking, but nothing is working, and as you may have guessed, I'm now getting a tad ticked off...
2005-12-14T15:17:00.000Z	Torez04		I'm trying to go off a few guides on the forums. One of the solutions to a problem about the default gateway constantly changing, is to edit a file, then supposedly type, "Sudo etc/init.d/networking restart" to put the new file into effect seemingly.
