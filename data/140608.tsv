2008-09-25T11:17:00.000Z	R-800	Seveas	no offense to you at all, as I appreciate your help, but I've been through all that, and something is missing in my system (I suspect anyway) that prevents me from following those instructions.  Something is not found after I get the GRUB prompt in the terminal.  But you've got me wondering, what might I install on a USB stick, for booting that way?
