2006-08-20T08:28:00.000Z	sapaki		i can't install ubuntu from the live cd's any ideas why
2006-08-20T08:29:00.000Z	Flannel	sapaki	try the alternate ISOs
2006-08-20T08:30:00.000Z	Flannel	sapaki	nothing.  Some hardware doesnt like the desktop (live) CD
2006-08-20T08:31:00.000Z	Flannel	sapaki	another thing is that you mightve burned the CD too quickly, try again at 4x.
