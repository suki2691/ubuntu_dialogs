2012-06-28T13:38:00.000Z	gaelfx	Steven_O	shouldn't be necessary to reset, but is the plugin actually enabled?
2012-06-28T13:39:00.000Z	gaelfx	Steven_O	something of that nature. yes
2012-06-28T13:48:00.000Z	gaelfx	Steven_O	the flashplugin installer is just a program that downloads and installs the plugin, are you sure the installer actually ran?
