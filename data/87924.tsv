2008-06-12T00:18:00.000Z	morpheus_bc		Hey guys, sorry to bother you, I just installed the latest ubuntu distrib on a usb drive.  Console works fine, but gdm does nothing after login.  Shutting down gdm and running "startx" gives a working gnome.  Any ideas ?

2008-06-12T00:20:00.000Z	morpheus_bc	nickrud	ok, thanks, I'll have a look and come back.
2008-06-12T00:20:00.000Z	nickrud	morpheus_bc	not promising I'll have the answer to a failure there by the way :)
