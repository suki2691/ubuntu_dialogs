2010-05-16T00:50:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Cork[home]	edit menu .. and uncheck them. right click on applications > edit menus
2010-05-16T00:51:00.000Z	Cork[home]	bastid_raZor	i mean more like preventing them ending up there att all, i use one of my wine profiles to extract windows installers, that a then copy out of wine to use in linux, then clear the profile
