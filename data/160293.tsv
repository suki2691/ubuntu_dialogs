2009-09-24T04:20:00.000Z	rawrs		is there a way to apply a custom ip and dns automatically when connecting to a wifi network?
2009-09-24T04:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rawrs	Yes, System > Preferences > Networking, just set up a profile for that network with static ip and dns
2009-09-24T04:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rawrs	No, but it's the only way to do it with network-manager, what's wrong with "that way" ?
