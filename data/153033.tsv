2006-12-30T09:55:00.000Z	lilly		my beryl keeps showing black windows! i have to reload beryl to fix it.... anyone knows how to fix it?
2006-12-30T09:56:00.000Z	LameBMX	lilly	... i dont know an exact setting to fix it ... but dont ever use your scroll wheel in beryl-manager ... it changes too many settings
2006-12-30T09:57:00.000Z	LameBMX	lilly	could the windows be not responding ... its a feature of beryl to darken them (a lot)
2006-12-30T09:57:00.000Z	lilly	LameBMX	its not the usual darkening.. its 100% black
