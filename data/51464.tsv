2010-04-22T15:41:00.000Z	Wipster	rocket16	Curly_Q , Ok I'l have a look for power manager options in BIOS, I dont see grub anyway because I only boot ubuntu. This problem occours when I havn't used the laptop for a while and the screen darkens and blanks and I wiggle the mouse to turn it back on, sometimes very rarely this popup happens in the tray linking to that blog and about power manager bugs
