2010-11-04T21:20:00.000Z	abarbaccia		hello all - i am unable to eject my CDROM with the button or by selecting eject from the menu. Does not work as root either! Anyone experience something similar?
2010-11-04T21:20:00.000Z	blakkheim	abarbaccia	sudo eject
2010-11-04T21:21:00.000Z	blakkheim	abarbaccia	if that doesn't work it is a hardware problem
2010-11-04T21:26:00.000Z	abarbaccia	blakkheim	does not eject when i type sudo eject. Thing is stuck in there for good. I was figuring something to do with the bios becuase i can't even get it open during POST. bleh.
