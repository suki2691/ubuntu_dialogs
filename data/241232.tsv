2005-04-20T08:39:00.000Z	eduardo		Hi folks. Quick question. All I want is X (no kde, gnome), GCC, emacs, and firefox. Only have 1.5gb hard drive. Will ubuntu let me install the bare necessities I need and not alot of other crap i dont have space for?

2005-04-20T08:45:00.000Z	seven_six_two	eduardo	the install is much less painful...much much less
