2012-03-11T02:44:00.000Z	MaWaLe	pfifo	 i think that the best server may be the Debian one
2012-03-11T02:47:00.000Z	pfifo	MaWaLe	really i go with centos opposed to fedora, but the difference isnt that noticable
2012-03-11T02:48:00.000Z	MaWaLe	pfifo	 i think that the best way to describe the difference is to say that it is like the freeze and volatile package in the debian project
2012-03-11T02:50:00.000Z	MaWaLe	pfifo	 so the RHES and the CentOS are more mature then Fedora (which i think is a "prototype" ;) )
