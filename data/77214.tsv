2008-10-20T20:15:00.000Z	Spudz		Hello all, I just wasted a whole morning today trying to share my internet with my housemates using wireless.  Both other pcs (mac and xp notebook) can see the cnxn, and join.  but the ip's are 169.254.x.y, and they cant load webpages.  can anyone explain to me what's going on?  Do I need to do something fancy with the linuxbox?
