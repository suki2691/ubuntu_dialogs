2007-02-15T06:32:00.000Z	jrib		Hi everyone, I'm trying to get my internet to work on an asus p5b deluxe.  Both eth0 and eth1 don't seem to work, although network manger claims both are "connected".  I cannot 'ping www.google.com'.  Not sure how to further troubleshoot this... any suggestions?

2007-02-15T06:34:00.000Z	jrib	Chadarius	is there a standard ip for me to try?  Also please note that I have to disconnect here to try the other computer since I don't have a router
