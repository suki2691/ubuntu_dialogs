2007-12-13T07:06:00.000Z	papuccino1		Just wanted to ask one quick question: If my Live CD installer get's stuck on language selection on my laptop is it because of the small RAM I have? Would the alternate (text-based) installer work?
2007-12-13T07:06:00.000Z	kelsin	papuccino1	trying the alternate text-mode installer is always a good idea for stalls on the live cd version
2007-12-13T07:07:00.000Z	kelsin	papuccino1	the installer steps are identical so it's just as easy (imo) but will get you a system to debug if there is an issue
