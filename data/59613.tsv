2009-04-24T02:01:00.000Z	bsanders		If I already have 8.10 installed, is there a way to upgrade from the 9.04 CD?
2009-04-24T02:02:00.000Z	jpnub	bsanders	clean installs are best, plus you can user ext4
2009-04-24T02:02:00.000Z	bsanders	jpnub	ahh, yeah, I am interested in the upgrade to ext4
2009-04-24T02:03:00.000Z	jpnub	bsanders	then you have to do a clean install :(
