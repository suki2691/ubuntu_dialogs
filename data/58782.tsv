2009-05-03T00:16:00.000Z	perillu		OpenGL applications seem to constantly flicker though.  Even glxgears, the display flickers it sort of "blinks" to white and back to the glxgears display.  It uses the video card:  Intel Corporation Mobile 915GM/GMS/910GML Express Graphics Controller      and the laptop is a Dell Latitude D510.  Can anyone help me?
