2008-05-17T10:05:00.000Z	kajo		Hey, I can't find any information on minimizing my installation of ubuntu right now... I am running fluxbox on an ubuntu install, and I want to delete all the programs it comes with that I don't use (thunderbird, for one example). I can't find an easy way to do this, to just 'delete programs I don't want'.
2008-05-17T10:05:00.000Z	m1r	kajo	, check for minimal ubuntu on forums
2008-05-17T10:06:00.000Z	m1r	kajo	, yes
2008-05-17T10:06:00.000Z	m1r	kajo	, cleanest way imo
