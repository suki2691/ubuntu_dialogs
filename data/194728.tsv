2006-04-22T14:35:00.000Z	TraceGreen		Hello, i know captive can help me write in NTFS, does linux have other such routine to help me to write to ntfs in linux?
2006-04-22T14:36:00.000Z	DBO	TraceGreen	yes, there are other projects, no they are not safe for usage...
2006-04-22T14:40:00.000Z	TraceGreen	DBO	thanks very much. I once tried captive, but it seems not stable.
2006-04-22T14:40:00.000Z	DBO	TraceGreen	Im not sure about other options, but http://www.linux-ntfs.org/ is an ongoing project as well... I do not believe it has a release for debian based systems though
