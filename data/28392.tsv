2010-08-13T06:41:00.000Z	techwizrd	Wiesshund	I am using an lcd. Lowering the screen resolution from the default (1680x1050) gets rid of the screen flickering, running at 1440x900 is not cool.
2010-08-13T06:41:00.000Z	Wiesshund	techwizrd	is 1440X900 its native?
2010-08-13T06:42:00.000Z	techwizrd	Wiesshund	the native is 1680x1050
