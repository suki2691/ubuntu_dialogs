2011-08-02T14:16:00.000Z	giany		if I use apt-add-repository it adds two lines in the sources.list file ..one with deb and one with deb-src..what can I do to skip the deb-src line?
2011-08-02T14:17:00.000Z	rdistorted	giany	comment out in sources.list
2011-08-02T14:17:00.000Z	giany	rdistorted	i have some automate tools that install some apps..i cannot manually edit that line :)
