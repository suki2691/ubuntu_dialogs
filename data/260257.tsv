2006-10-24T10:38:00.000Z	Twister829		Hey... I have a really noob problem... on all the apps I'm trying to install I can ./configure just fine... but everytime I type ./make it just gives me a no file or directory found error message...
2006-10-24T10:38:00.000Z	Twister829		Can anyone help?
2006-10-24T10:38:00.000Z	MarcN	Twister829	type    make   not ./make
