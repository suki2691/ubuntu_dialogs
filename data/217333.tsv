2005-09-27T10:31:00.000Z	robbkidd	jblack	The breezy upgrade broke my X because of new font locations. A "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" will fix this.

2005-09-27T10:32:00.000Z	robbkidd	jblack	I don't quite follow what you mean by eaten device files?  You've lost entries in /dev? Or lost the drivers in /usr?
