2011-07-18T22:24:00.000Z	nolcotin		I would like to do a fresh install of Ubuntu, it's been a while since I've tried linux in the desktop environment (as opposed to for development and work only). Is the 64 bit version recommmended?

2011-07-18T22:26:00.000Z	coz_	nolcotin	  you have several options,, live cd...alternate cd..and minimal in stall cd
