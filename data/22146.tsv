2011-04-15T22:55:00.000Z	WXZ		can I download the 3.0.0 version of nautilus, even though it's not in the official repositories for my ubuntu version?
2011-04-15T22:55:00.000Z	itaylor57	WXZ	no gnome 3 yet
2011-04-15T22:56:00.000Z	WXZ	itaylor57	but the nautilus 3.0 is ready anyway
2011-04-15T22:57:00.000Z	itaylor57	WXZ	you can look for a PPA but there isn't any ready yet for ubuntu
