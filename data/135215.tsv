2009-03-30T07:27:00.000Z	dub		I've inherited a 6.04 LTS desktop box that hasnt had any updates in who knows how long, I get 404s when I try to update, has there been any major repo changes I should be aware of?

2009-03-30T07:28:00.000Z	ziroday	dub	no repo's exist for it
2009-03-30T07:29:00.000Z	ziroday	dub	err my bad, disregard me, I'm an idiot
