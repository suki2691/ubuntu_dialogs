2012-05-16T20:05:00.000Z	JonEdney		This is going to sound noobish, but I'm still a noob for this advanced Linux stuff.  How do I install a program?  It came in a .tar.gz and is full of .so files.
2012-05-16T20:06:00.000Z	ikonia	JonEdney	what are you trying to install ?
2012-05-16T20:07:00.000Z	ikonia	JonEdney	there should be a "README" or INSTALL file within the tar file
2012-05-16T20:07:00.000Z	ikonia	JonEdney	the INSTALL or README file will detail how to install it
