2009-04-27T15:06:00.000Z	Slart		for some reason padevchooser doesn't work for me in jaunty.. I read a post somewhere about it being deprecated.. is there something else I can run to get a tray icon for quickly getting to a pulseaudio volume control?
2009-04-27T15:07:00.000Z	slytherin	Slart	tried installing gnome-volume-control-pulse?
2009-04-27T15:08:00.000Z	Slart	slytherin	ah.. never seen that one before.. thanks
2009-04-27T15:12:00.000Z	Slart	slytherin	hmm.. it doesn't allow me to move audio from one soundcard to another..thanks anyway
