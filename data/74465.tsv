2009-03-04T20:18:00.000Z	RizR		hello. Is there a way to open a new tab in an already opened gnome-terminal using command line?
2009-03-04T20:18:00.000Z	RizR		It's like doing gnome-terminal --tab but attach it with an existing window rather than opening a new one
2009-03-04T20:19:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	RizR	ctrl+shift+t
2009-03-04T20:20:00.000Z	RizR	arvind_khadri	that opens in current gnome-terminal window. I need in "any" open gnome-terminal window
