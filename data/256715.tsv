2004-12-01T06:48:00.000Z	volker	atropus	this is ok - it boots with the "single" parameter, which should give you the root console
2004-12-01T06:54:00.000Z	atropus	volker	but anyone can use root console when they choose recovery mode
2004-12-01T06:56:00.000Z	volker	atropus	anyone with physical access to your computer will be able to get into the system - the only way to prevent this is using a bios password and password protect your grub
