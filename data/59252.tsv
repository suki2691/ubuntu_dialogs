2009-11-07T06:07:00.000Z	Joeseph		hmmm...  I got "tar: Cowardly refusing to create an empty archive"  ...  What did I do wrong?
2009-11-07T06:09:00.000Z	VCoolio	Joeseph	you need to specify what you want to be archived before pointing to the target.tar.gz
2010-01-11T03:05:00.000Z	VCoolio	Joeseph	have a look at gnome-do or kupfer if you want to launch stuff but no panel
2010-01-11T03:06:00.000Z	Joeseph	VCoolio	Yeah, I'm trying to see if I like Gnome-do, AWN, Cairo dock, or kupfer the best.
