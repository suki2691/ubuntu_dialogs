2010-02-05T18:04:00.000Z	Slart	n00p	I think there is.. if you check the torrents and alternative stuff on the download page
2010-02-05T18:05:00.000Z	n00p		I'm sure there's itanium 64 and AMD64. AMD64 is what you'd run on an x86-64. I'm sure of this because I couldn't find an x86 64 dist
2010-02-05T18:06:00.000Z	Slart	n00p	hmm.. no.. didn't find a x86-64 version.. but I'm pretty sure I've seen one in the past
