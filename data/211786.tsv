2008-07-29T16:04:00.000Z	mib_fpxuhr		Hi :) Anyone know how I can use konversation(irc client) through my isp, which blocks irc traffic?  Currently I'm using mibbit, it is a web interface to an irc proxy. But, I want the abilities of the konqueror client, just tunneling through an irc proxy, perhaps.  Any suggestions?
