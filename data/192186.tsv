2006-04-05T14:42:00.000Z	m_0_r_0_n		Hi, I ve reinstalled Ubuntu. Now I want to install Sun Java (fakeroot make-jpkg jdk-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin) and I get the message: "dpkg-architecture: warning: Couldn't determine gcc system type, falling back to default (native compilation)" Which compiler is best for installation?
2006-04-05T14:43:00.000Z	healot	m_0_r_0_n	do you installed "build-essential" yet?
2006-04-05T14:44:00.000Z	healot	m_0_r_0_n	or you're on PPC perhaps?
2006-04-05T14:48:00.000Z	m_0_r_0_n	healot	thanks for the hint, I am installing build-essential...
