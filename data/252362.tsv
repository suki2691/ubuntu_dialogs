2005-01-20T13:38:00.000Z	jeronimo	lestercolza	yes, but that doesn't solve that problem... the better solution should be not using some command any more... :(
2005-01-20T13:38:00.000Z	lestercolza	jeronimo	, sure , but at the last extremity ...
2005-01-20T13:39:00.000Z	jeronimo	lestercolza	yes... I know about that... but the last way :-)
