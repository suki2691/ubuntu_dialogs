2012-01-01T18:43:00.000Z	aimwin	yeats	actually I was writing tutorial for newbies who want Ubuntu 11.10 classic menu, and not unity, so I was suggesting Edubuntu 11.10 with option classic-fallback and testing the installation to see if it is stable, and it was very stable, till I got into Gnome-Shell. So if some one could help here, it will be great so I can proof if that method is unstable way of achieve Ubuntu 11.10...
2012-01-01T19:00:00.000Z	aimwin	yeats	mongy:  Thank you for your responses. I will move on to the forums instead now
