2011-02-19T10:38:00.000Z	nmvictor	abhinav_singh	cat /proc/cpu.info
2011-02-19T10:39:00.000Z	nmvictor	abhinav_singh	run that command I guess, Im told their is a flag to indicate 64 bit , if the flag s missing on that output, its probably a 32 bit, You computer manual might also help
2011-02-19T10:40:00.000Z	abhinav_singh	nmvictor	I am not getting the flag..
