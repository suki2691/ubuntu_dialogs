2010-11-08T03:08:00.000Z	n1md4	murukesh	thanks.  Where should I look next? (Which manual;)
2010-11-08T03:20:00.000Z	n1md4	murukesh	I tweaked alsamixer.  Headphones was muted.  Unmutting that now allows music through the head phones, but not the onboard speakers, and when I disconnect the headphones it then plays through speakers ;)  WIN
