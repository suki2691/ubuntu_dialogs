2010-03-26T22:45:00.000Z	troels		Hi - I'm running Ubuntu 9.1 and I want to disable the startup sound. I've looked in System-Settings-Sound but the only option here is to turn of ALL sound, or change themes. I've looked in the System-administration-login, but nothing there either. how do I turn i of?
