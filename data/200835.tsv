2008-02-27T07:43:00.000Z	rseeber		Hello, I'm having a problem with my Ubuntu computer taking up all my wireless bandwidth. I have an ubuntu and a windows box next to each other and when ever the ubuntu box is downloading something, it almost kills my connection on the windows box

2008-02-27T07:44:00.000Z	rseeber	wweasel	when i download on the windows box, the ubuntu box doesn't seem to slow down
2008-02-27T07:44:00.000Z	wweasel	rseeber	hmm, no idea then. sorry.
