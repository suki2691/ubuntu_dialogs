2007-10-23T03:54:00.000Z	Tamale		Hello all!  How do I get DHCP networking to work with my standard integrated ethernet controller in gutsy?  I can't get an address from my router in Gutsy but it works perfectly fine when I reboot to my edgy install or windows.  Help please!
2007-10-23T03:55:00.000Z	Tamale		I can't even get a standard DHCP address
