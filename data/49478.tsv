2010-05-11T03:51:00.000Z	Appetite		In the terminal, is there a way to add support to show the ? characters as they should be? i dont want to completely switch it to another locale, i want to retain the current locale, but support russian + special (áßéëåéëg®bœ) chars for example
2010-05-11T03:52:00.000Z	VCoolio	Appetite	try another terminal, like rxvt-unicode
2010-05-11T03:53:00.000Z	Appetite	VCoolio	if i am SSH'ing or am on TTY how do i support it though
2010-05-11T03:55:00.000Z	VCoolio	Appetite	don't know; change your $TERM variable? use tmux/screen?
