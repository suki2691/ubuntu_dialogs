2008-06-22T11:10:00.000Z	[dmsuperman]	Ayabara	honestly, if you can't find what you're looking for in them I have no idea what you want
2008-06-22T11:11:00.000Z	[dmsuperman]	Ayabara	agree with Dr_Willis, XChat is amazing and irssi is also quite good
2008-06-22T11:14:00.000Z	[dmsuperman]	Ayabara	I know what you mean...I've always wanted a way to see if somebody called my name. I've resorted to logging chats in xchat, with a grep for my name nightly deleting all unimportant lines
