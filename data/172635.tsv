2006-09-21T08:25:00.000Z	Keddie		help, I can't update ubuntu anymore. The update icon shows up, but when I click on install updates it just checks for updates again but doesn't install them. I tried to run synaptic, but it won't even start up. I did an apt-get update and then upgrade and even install, but it doesn't work.
