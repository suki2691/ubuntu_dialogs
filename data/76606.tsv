2009-02-14T06:55:00.000Z	rambo298		is there an ubuntu tool to display the initial response to an HTTP GET?  I want to verify that the HTTP status response is what it should be
2009-02-14T06:56:00.000Z	jrib	rambo298	telnet?
2009-02-14T06:56:00.000Z	rambo298	jrib	so telnet to port 80 and manually enter the HTTP GET?
2009-02-14T06:57:00.000Z	jrib	rambo298	using the proper syntax, yeah
