2008-08-29T03:30:00.000Z	blackvd		I just pulled the most bonehead move on Linux of all time here. I accidentally uninstalled my kernel so now when I boot up I only have the option of mem test
2008-08-29T03:30:00.000Z	blackvd		:(
2008-08-29T03:31:00.000Z	blackvd		any easy way to fix it or do I have to just reinstall?
2008-08-29T03:32:00.000Z	carandraug	blackvd	did you really erased the kernel or only the entracnce from menu.lst?
