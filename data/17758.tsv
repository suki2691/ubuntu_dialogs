2011-05-11T21:27:00.000Z	roasted_	sebsebseb	now, I'm having a little difficulty understanding something. LVM is basically virtual partitions, right?
2011-05-11T21:30:00.000Z	roasted_	sebsebseb	this is a mixture of LVM and raid. That siad, is LVM raid, or is LVM virtual partitioning? Or... is it both?
