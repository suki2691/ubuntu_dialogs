2005-03-24T07:27:00.000Z	spiderworm		hey all im pretty much arriving at the conclusion that fedora sucks ass.  im having all sorts of package upgrade problems and am looking for a easy to use desktop distro that has one centralized repo with every package known to man including mythtv packages and nearly perfectly stable bleeding edge packages... is this ubuntu?

2005-03-24T07:30:00.000Z	spiderworm	farruinn	i used to use debian and i know ubuntu is based on debian, had probs with debian because i was running stable core and everything i wanted was in the unstable branch, trying to run those caused all sorts of problems, does ubuntu also have stable, testing, and unstable?
