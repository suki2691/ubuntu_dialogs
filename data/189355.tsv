2010-02-19T00:53:00.000Z	Wubuntu		I have a Nvidia GeForce4 MX 420 video card that gives me screen resolution problems with Ubuntu 9.10. Can anyone please offer me any assistance?
2010-02-19T00:54:00.000Z	coz_	Wubuntu	 did you open nvidia-settings with sudo      then set the resolution and click write to xconfig?
2010-02-19T00:56:00.000Z	coz_	Wubuntu	 you have to open    sudo nvidia-settings for it to work
2010-02-19T00:56:00.000Z	coz_	Wubuntu	 if that doesnt work you could go to #nvidia channel for more in depth help
