2006-03-24T07:20:00.000Z	WebLOCH	Fujitsu	well my current state is this, I have apache2, php4 and mysql installed, and it seems like PHP is parsing correctly, unless i try to load phpmyadmin, in which case it tries to download it instead, and if i make any SQL calls it tells me the function is undefined
