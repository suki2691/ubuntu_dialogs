2005-10-19T16:06:00.000Z	raf256		as in, configuration files layout (etc, init.d, and so on) is identical?

2005-10-19T16:07:00.000Z	Ky0tIk	raf256	 ubuntu is very stable and very current with packages in the stable side... whereas debian stays behind a long way...   as far as configuration  ubuntu makes a lot automatic... where as debian asks for a lot of user interaction during package updating...
