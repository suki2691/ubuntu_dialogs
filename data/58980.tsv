2009-04-27T18:35:00.000Z	mib_i3mlvva2		Hi all, is there some page where it lists the specific changes in 9.04 as opposed to 8.10 ubuntu?
2009-04-27T18:35:00.000Z	Jeruvy	mib_i3mlvva2	check the release notes
2009-04-27T18:36:00.000Z	mib_i3mlvva2	Jeruvy	I did, but they were so little, apart from the cloud thing for server, there isnt anything much
2009-04-27T18:37:00.000Z	Jeruvy	mib_i3mlvva2	there are quite few changes, ext4 for one, keep in mind this is a support channel, so if you'd like to talk about it, #ubuntu-chat may be a better place
