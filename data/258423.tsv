2005-04-14T06:02:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	kent	it seems some update messed up my mixer settings. apps like xine listen to the mixer now, but rythmbox et all don't
2005-04-14T06:04:00.000Z	kent	HiddenWolf	I dont know what causes my problem. I can listen to music if i set gstreamer-properties to use alsa. But if i set it to esd, and try to play the audio-test, I cant hear something. It seems esd wont play sound :(
