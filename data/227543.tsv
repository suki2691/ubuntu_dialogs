2005-08-27T09:18:00.000Z	eduol		Im considering Ubuntu for my laptop but, does xorg in Ubuntu works with via cle266?
2005-08-27T09:19:00.000Z	Jowi	eduol	i'm using an epia m-10000 with cle266. everything works except DRI (direct rendering)
2005-08-27T09:20:00.000Z	Jowi	eduol	so as long as you don't need to play 3d games you're fine. xorg uses the "via" driver
