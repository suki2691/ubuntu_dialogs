2005-12-01T13:30:00.000Z	TGM		As stupid as this may sound. How do you install things that didn;t come with the OS? I've gone out and found a few programs here and there for Linux Ubuntu and sometimes Debian since it's debian based but I can't figure out how to install a one of them for the life of me. Help?

2005-12-01T13:31:00.000Z	sls	TGM	dpkg -i (pakage name)
2005-12-01T13:31:00.000Z	sls	TGM	then apt-get update
