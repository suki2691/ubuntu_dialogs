2009-10-17T02:03:00.000Z	nodgedodge		hi, i installed ubuntu 8.04 on my computer(some time ago) parallel to windows and after 2 times booting or so, my computer wouldnt load the bootmanager any more and boot with windows directly. so my problem is, that i would like to access the files in my ubuntu home folder, but i cant because i m not the owner
2009-10-17T02:04:00.000Z	nodgedodge		im using the 9.04 ubuntu demo cd right now btw
