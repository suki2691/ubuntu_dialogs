2012-07-16T06:25:00.000Z	volan		I am trying to fix/setup a dsl connection remotely. I set up the box several months ago (11.10) for my father and at the time I thought it was odd, but the internet connection "just worked". I didn't have to put in a password or mess with any settings. I connected a fresh install ubuntu where a winXP box was, and ba-bam, there was internet.

2012-07-16T06:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	volan	can you connect with windows?
