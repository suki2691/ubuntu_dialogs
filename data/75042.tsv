2008-11-15T02:04:00.000Z	EggsOverGreasy		I did a fresh 8.10 desktop install with Intel graphics card but 1280x1040 is available only in 5:4 ratio while my LCD requires 4:3. xorg.conf has no enteries. I search Ubuntu support and while they have lots of info on nvidia and ATI, I found little for Intel. Do I need to install special drivers or.... what?

2008-11-15T02:08:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	EggsOverGreasy	there are tools for your graphiic card, like nvidia-settings (something else for ati)
