2007-03-12T13:07:00.000Z	z9999	dilch	Trying to find the equivalent command of one used in unix on ubuntu, the 'set' command. The 'set' in ububtu gives something different.
2007-03-12T13:19:00.000Z	z9999	dilch	& h1st0: OK we finally figured it out, the 'env' command gives similar output to the 'set' command in unix. Thanks
