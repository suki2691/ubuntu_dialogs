2007-02-15T10:44:00.000Z	elyon225	xenos76	What version of Ubuntu/Firefox do you have?  And what version of the flash player did you try installing?
2007-02-15T10:44:00.000Z	elyon225	xenos76	Also, please explain what "doesn't work" means.
2007-02-15T10:47:00.000Z	elyon225	xenos76	With the flash player, extract the libflashplugin.so file into /usr/lib/firefox/plugins   Then restart firefox and you should be good to go.
