2011-02-15T21:24:00.000Z	Silex		how do I print the "mod" (as in chmod) a file has? I want a numeric value
2011-02-15T21:24:00.000Z	Silex		something like 660 or 644
2011-02-15T21:25:00.000Z	Silex		I could add the rw thing in ls -l but I want to make sure
2011-02-15T21:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Silex	ls -l file
