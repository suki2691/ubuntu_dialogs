2007-08-01T09:43:00.000Z	nua		Hi, I'm having problems installing Ubuntu on an old IBM box. The install freezes when starting the partition drives part of the setup. Please PM me if you have any ideas I can try, thanks!
2007-08-01T09:43:00.000Z	Pici	nua	Have you tried using the alternate CD?
2007-08-01T09:44:00.000Z	nua	Pici	Yes, also Ubuntu Server and Debian Net Install
2007-08-01T09:44:00.000Z	nua	Pici	I've also tried using ide=nodma at boot time
