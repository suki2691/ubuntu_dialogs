2007-06-04T14:07:00.000Z	tao4mike		my firefox and thunderbird will not start, it says the process is already running.  however they are not listed anywhere in the system monitor applet.  last night my Nautilus locked up and I killed the process..at which point the pc went to like a terminal screen only and I pressed ctrl alt del and it restarted.  I am new to linux and was wondering how to get them to stop running so I can start them up again. thank you very much!
