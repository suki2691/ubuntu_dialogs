2006-07-04T05:06:00.000Z	Luke-b		Hi, I have installed CentOS on my computer, and now I want to install Ubuntu aswell. Can I use the same swap space partition for both OSs?
2006-07-04T05:07:00.000Z	Luke-b		Also, how do you recommend I re-partition my drive? I don't want to risk losing all my stuff
2006-07-04T05:08:00.000Z	Luke-b		I will backup :) but how should I go about doing it after that?
2006-07-04T05:08:00.000Z	Stormx2	Luke-b	whatever happens, don't back up.
