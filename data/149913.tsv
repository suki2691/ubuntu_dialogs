2007-11-14T21:22:00.000Z	moonlite		I'd like to search launchpad for bugs in the packages virtualbox-ose and virtualbox-ose-modules. How do i do that? Just searching for virtualbox under bugs "kind of" works, but it also lists a lot of unrelated bugs.
2007-11-14T21:22:00.000Z	moonlite		so i'd like to specify the package and launchpad doesn't seem to let me
2007-11-14T21:22:00.000Z	Pici	moonlite	just open those package's pages, click the bugs tab and then search.  If you need any other help ask in #launchpad.
2007-11-14T21:23:00.000Z	moonlite	Pici	ok thanks
