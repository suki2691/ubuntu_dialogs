2010-06-15T18:11:00.000Z	Bjartr		Hi, I sometimes get a bunch of error bells in a row while I'm not doing anything. I (thought) I'd disabled error bells already, how can I determine the source program causing the bells and/or how can I turn them off for good?

2010-06-15T18:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Bjartr	look at the syslog and see if there are any obvious warnings
2010-06-15T18:14:00.000Z	Bjartr	ikonia	nothing that looks like it matches the times I heard the bells
