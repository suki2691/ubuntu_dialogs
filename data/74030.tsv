2010-05-09T03:54:00.000Z	hmw	jthing	130 is way too hot, do not let it run when it gets that hot, you will damage it
2010-05-09T03:56:00.000Z	hmw	jthing	does the box have windows? does it get as hot there? Try to fix cooling, remove and reapply heat paste perhaps
2010-05-09T03:57:00.000Z	hmw	jthing	clean fan and the thing that collects dust (is it named "cooling body")?
