2006-11-05T09:29:00.000Z	dutchy		if i'd like to use the external harddrive im going to buy in both windows or linux, which filesystem should i use, fat32 or ext* (ie. does fat have a better implementation on linux or ext* a better implementation on windows) ?

2006-11-05T09:30:00.000Z	dutchy	rbil	just with my own, i can install any drivers i'd like
2006-11-05T09:31:00.000Z	rbil	dutchy	well then go ext3. much better file system
