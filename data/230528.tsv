2005-10-26T05:38:00.000Z	ryanpg		another noobish question here... I keep reading "no updates except bug fixes" now is that really really true? I mean when gaim 2.0 comes out next month it wont go into ubuntu?  Now that OO.o 2.0 is out ubuntu won't include an updated package? or did I miss something in my reading?
2005-10-26T05:39:00.000Z	dabaR	ryanpg	you did not miss. a released version of ubuntu gets only security updates(bug fixes) and new versions go into the development version, and backports.

2005-10-26T05:45:00.000Z	ryanpg	dabaR	I'm not sure I can live with just security fixes :P how often does backports and development get updated?
