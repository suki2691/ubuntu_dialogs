2010-05-02T03:02:00.000Z	wjazrawi		hi. i've been having trouble installing ubuntu 10.04 from cd onto my laptop. it keeps stalling at various places throughout the installation, from the very beginning when choosing the timezone to somewhere in the installation phase. the most i've got to is around 35%. i've carried out a md5sum on the iso and everything checks out. any help would be appreciated. thanks

2010-05-02T03:04:00.000Z	wjazrawi	RandomTime	it's fairly old, around 6-7 years
2010-05-02T03:06:00.000Z	RandomTime	wjazrawi	ok, still quite odd that it doesn't finish. I havn't tried the live CD, but I remember an older version had a non-live installer as well. If that's the case with 9.10, try thbat
