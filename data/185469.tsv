2006-06-03T10:23:00.000Z	ralphie2006		how do I access a hard drive from a live cd?
2006-06-03T10:24:00.000Z	ralphie2006		I get permission denied when I tried to mount with /dev/hda1 /mnt/hd1
2006-06-03T10:24:00.000Z	gdb	ralphie2006	Are you trying to mount it with root permissions or as your normal user account?
2006-06-03T10:25:00.000Z	gdb	ralphie2006	And which password are you entering? Your own or a root password that you may have set at some other time?
