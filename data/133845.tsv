2007-05-19T15:13:00.000Z	GAPeach		Hi, I have a quick question. I am trying to do a repair install of Windows XP. I started, but when my computer restarted, instead of continuing on to the Windows XP Install screen, it heads back to GRUB. Is there a way I can bypass GRUB so I can finish repairing Windows XP?
