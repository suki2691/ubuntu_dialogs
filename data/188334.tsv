2007-04-20T16:09:00.000Z	mc44	linoleum	nvidia-glx-new
2007-04-20T16:11:00.000Z	linoleum	mc44	tkx. How is it possible that I can see it with an apt-cache search nvidia-glx-new, and I cannot see them in the add/remove appliction, nor in the restricted drivers manager?
2007-04-20T16:12:00.000Z	mc44	linoleum	hmm not sure, I thought retricted manager could cope with that
