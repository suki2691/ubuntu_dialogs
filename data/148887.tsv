2007-02-09T14:09:00.000Z	klimraamkosie		I'm supposed to edit /etc/fstab to get my system going. So I use the alternate disc's recovery mode and then try to edit with gedit like this "sudo gedit /etc/fstab", this doesn't work. Although the ubuntu help pages online tell me I should do it. And I try todo sudo vi /etc/fstab. Vi doesn't want to do anything, or it's a really old version for people who know how to work with it, I don't.
