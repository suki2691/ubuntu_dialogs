2005-12-22T13:33:00.000Z	jnk	Hoxzer	so you download source code in a tar.gz or tar.bz2 file right?
2005-12-22T13:35:00.000Z	jnk	Hoxzer	you should really read the README and INSTALL files if they exist
2005-12-22T13:37:00.000Z	jnk	Hoxzer	I suspect you've downloaded the source code, and this readme file is for the binary ("compiled") version
