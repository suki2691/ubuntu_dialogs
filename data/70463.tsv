2009-08-31T01:47:00.000Z	reggieP123		so anyone have any ideas on differences in wifi performance between karmic and jaunty
2009-08-31T01:47:00.000Z	reggieP123		ahh thank you i'm really new to the ubuntu world thanx for the advice
2009-08-31T01:48:00.000Z	reggieP123		well noticed a wifi issue in 9.04 so before trying out 9.10 want to see if there is a fix
2009-08-31T01:49:00.000Z	kevdog_	reggieP123	 Is this a driver related issue since the ubuntu release shouldn't really matter?
