2009-08-05T21:49:00.000Z	goku12205		i'm running a smtp server on my desktop but i'm on my laptop so i wont to exploit it to secure it i found that port25 is open
2009-08-05T21:50:00.000Z	jrib	goku12205	how does exploiting something secure it?  That makes no sense
2009-08-05T21:54:00.000Z	jrib	goku12205	why do you want a telnet server?  Most people use ssh now
