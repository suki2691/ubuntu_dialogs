2007-10-20T10:57:00.000Z	BlaenkDenum		I'm trying to mount my windows partition but it says I don't have the privilege to do it, what should I do?
2007-10-20T10:58:00.000Z	Sir_Sid	BlaenkDenum	type sudo before you mount
2007-10-20T10:58:00.000Z	Sir_Sid	BlaenkDenum	you may want to edit fstab to auto mount at boot
2007-10-20T10:58:00.000Z	BlaenkDenum	Sir_Sid	I added the line to fstab, what's the command to re-mount or mount the drives?
