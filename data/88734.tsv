2008-06-05T22:00:00.000Z	Jef2		I went to "sudo vi /etc/X11/xorg.conf" to change some stuff, how do i save my changes? If i press "CTRL + X" all i get is this :^X mode (^]^D^E^F^I^K^L^N^O^Ps^U^V^Y)
2008-06-05T22:01:00.000Z	Jef2		okay, i was told to go to that specific one because i couldnt get the others to work right.
2008-06-05T22:02:00.000Z	Jef2		escape then :wq to save changes to vi?
