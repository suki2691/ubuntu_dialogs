2010-11-03T12:09:00.000Z	rhalff		hi I've debootstrapped ubuntu lucid, but I want some packages available in the netbook edition, can I add some apt sources for this ?
2010-11-03T12:10:00.000Z	rhalff		it's meant to be a very minimal install
2010-11-03T12:10:00.000Z	blackshirt	rhalff	yes, exactly you can add repo from that
2010-11-03T12:11:00.000Z	rhalff	blackshirt	you know what is the one ? just netbook instead of lucid ?
