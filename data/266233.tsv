2009-08-16T14:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mrgenericuser	 i have befor.. but i dont see the need for seperate X screens
2009-08-16T14:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mrgenericuser	   You could just disable one screeen  launch game.. then restore it..
2009-08-16T14:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mrgenericuser	 most games ive tried dont have that issue.. only some of the older/badly programmed ones.
