2008-12-31T01:37:00.000Z	nonix4	GillyGilly2	kvm has no problems w/ 64-bit cpus... well, have tried only w/ cpu virtualization support, which most 64-bit cpus do have.
2008-12-31T01:39:00.000Z	nonix4	GillyGilly2	any particular reason for using virtualpc/vmware/whatever-non-stock-vm as opposed to "sudo aptitude install kvm libvirt-bin virt-manager"
