2008-03-06T04:04:00.000Z	Sindacious		Hey, could anyone tell me how I can tell if I have the 64 bit of ubuntu, or the i386 on my machine?
2008-03-06T04:05:00.000Z	Sindacious		i686, that the 64 bit?
2008-03-06T04:06:00.000Z	kenro	Sindacious	 alt, search your pkg mgr for linux-image
2008-03-06T04:06:00.000Z	kenro	Sindacious	uname -a is quicker.
