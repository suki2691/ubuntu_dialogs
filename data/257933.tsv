2007-10-21T03:27:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		is gutsy likely to get OpenOffice.org 2.3.1 when it comes out? 2.3.0 has a really annoying formatting bug :(
2007-10-21T03:27:00.000Z	don-o	Ex-Cyber	you can check by searching for openoffice at packages.ubuntu.com
2007-10-21T03:28:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber	don-o	how can I use that to check the future status of a package version that isn't even released upstream yet?
2007-10-21T03:28:00.000Z	don-o	Ex-Cyber	oh. i thought you were asking about the current version.
