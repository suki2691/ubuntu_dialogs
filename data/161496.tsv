2007-01-08T08:38:00.000Z	atarinox		ok i tried disabling ipv6 in swiftfox...but still slow. Seems like my page-loading is much faster in Epiphany as opposed to Firefox...could it be another config setting?
2007-01-08T08:39:00.000Z	kitche	atarinox	yes ipv6 module that is in ubuntu
2007-01-08T08:41:00.000Z	atarinox	kitche	should these instructions for disabling ipv6 work on xubuntu?
2007-01-08T08:41:00.000Z	kitche	atarinox	yes since xubuntu just uses xfce desktop environment instead of gnome
