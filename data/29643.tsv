2010-10-05T08:56:00.000Z	HaPK_PerCar		I've been wondering... I recently installed the whole Kubuntu desktop, and let kdm to do the user login process. How can I change it back to gdm?
2010-10-05T08:57:00.000Z	Random832	HaPK_PerCar	i think dpkg-reconfigure gdm can do it
2010-10-05T08:58:00.000Z	HaPK_PerCar	Random832	kevdog, I'll try that
