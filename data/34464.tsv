2011-08-16T00:33:00.000Z	n2diy		 I upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10, and i lost some of my system sounds. Thunderbird doesn't beep, or play a .wav when I receive e-mail, xchat-gnome doesn't beep when someone uses my nick, but korganizer's calendar alarm beep works, and I can play .wav files when I double click them, ideas?
2011-08-16T00:35:00.000Z	aj00200	n2diy	is it possible that the sound profile was changed?
2011-08-16T00:36:00.000Z	aj00200	n2diy	I think you get to the sound settings at System > Preferences > Sound
2011-08-16T00:38:00.000Z	n2diy	aj00200	thanks, but I double and triple checked my menu options.
