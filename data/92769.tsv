2008-05-12T08:28:00.000Z	mm_202	fde	Yes, I know.  I would of but my dumb friend ordered a $350 3Com (?) RAID Controller but for PCI-X, not PCI nor PCI-E...

2008-05-12T08:32:00.000Z	mm_202	fde	nothing to do with the BIOS, its a completely different BUS architecture, and he ordered from some dude online.  Anyone need a high-end server hw RAID controller?
