2011-09-18T16:05:00.000Z	madjoe		I can't find "Adobe Flash Plugin" in my Software of Ubuntu 11.10... there's only a specific one for Firefox, not for all the other browsers...

2011-09-18T16:07:00.000Z	madjoe	dr_willis	ok, thanks... I've read some bad comments on that one, so I was hoping there's a better one :)
