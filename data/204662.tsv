2005-12-13T17:04:00.000Z	kandinski		I just installed the ATI binary drivers (Ubuntu Breezy package on an updated Ubuntu Breezy system) on my athlon 1200 with a generic ATI 9200. They work fine for GL.

2005-12-13T17:05:00.000Z	BenUrban	kandinski	i suggest you get some videos that do not depict ass
2005-12-13T17:05:00.000Z	kandinski	BenUrban	you are funny. I got videos showing horse. It still looks like ass.
