2009-03-30T22:37:00.000Z	Dante123		hi all, I have ubuntu installed on a sony vaio laptop fx120.  When I go to shut it down, the orange bar goes down until it is gone but the pc never completely turns off.  I have acpi=off in boot parameters (cause that was the only way I could get the livecd to load up).  Any suggestions?
