2008-12-19T07:46:00.000Z	Philip_		hello I was wondering if some one could tell me how to boot to ubuntu on Vista Home Preium
2008-12-19T07:47:00.000Z	lucent	Philip_	stick cd into drive... reboot?
2008-12-19T07:48:00.000Z	lucent	Philip_	depending on how shady and strange your install was alongside Vista, it may be that the bootloader was not "engaged" properly or that Vista just peed all over it
2008-12-19T07:49:00.000Z	lucent	Philip_	it's a complicated thing to diagnose in one or two sentences, got 10 minutes?  hit me on privmsg we'll walk through it
