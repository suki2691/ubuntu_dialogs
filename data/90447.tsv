2008-05-16T00:37:00.000Z	Nuno_Martins		hey!! I need one "tutorial" for the installation of ubuntu 8.04 Server Edition. Can help me?
2008-05-16T00:38:00.000Z	jrib	Nuno_Martins	you just put in the server cd and boot from it
2008-05-16T00:39:00.000Z	Nuno_Martins	jrib	I never use ubuntu server edition, and I don't know how to install and configure it
2008-05-16T00:39:00.000Z	jrib	Nuno_Martins	I just told you how to install it though.  Here is the server guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/index.html
