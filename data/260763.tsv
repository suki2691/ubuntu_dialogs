2008-06-01T19:09:00.000Z	tjurskallen		hi all. what's the reason a desktop ubuntu kernel does not support over 4 gigs of ram?
2008-06-01T19:10:00.000Z	tjurskallen		32-bit kernels with PAE enabled should support up to 64 gigs of ram no?
2008-06-01T19:12:00.000Z	tjurskallen		just wondering why pae is not enabled by default...
2008-06-01T19:13:00.000Z	jbroome	tjurskallen	because the majority of people don't need it
