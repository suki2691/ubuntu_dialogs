2009-06-09T21:25:00.000Z	znh		I'm using Ubuntu daily on this USB stick.. It's cool but it doesn't keep any changes. Is it possible to keep changes?
2009-06-09T21:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	znh	 there is the usb-disk creator tool in ubuntu that can make a bootable thumbdrive that can keep changes.  but you need to boot ubuntu to use the tool. :)
