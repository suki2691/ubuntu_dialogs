2009-07-08T21:18:00.000Z	stevem		OK I've installed Ubuntu 9.04 on my box (haven't used it since 6.04)... X starts up in blackness with just the little circle timer cursor but doesn't do anything (although I can move the mouse)... any tips? (p.s. Ctrl+Alt+F1 does nothing)
2009-07-08T21:18:00.000Z	stevem		^ see
