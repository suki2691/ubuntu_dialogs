2009-11-26T01:46:00.000Z	tkmsr		i want to remove the first user of ubuntu which is created during installation from the sudoers list and instead add another
2009-11-26T01:47:00.000Z	tkmsr		or rather say I want to change its group
2009-11-26T01:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tkmsr	 add the new user first and be sure they have all the proper sudo  permissions and work properly befor removing the 1st :)    seen a few people do it backwards and have to  fix things
2009-11-26T01:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tkmsr	 thats doable.  I think theres a user admin tool that can do it. but ive rarely messed with it.
