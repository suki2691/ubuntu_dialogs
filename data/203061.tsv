2005-12-28T09:33:00.000Z	richard		Well Ubuntu is like many distros a branch or the offspring of the Debian project. Currently there are just enough differences to make them each seperate distros. I am wondering when they will once ore converge and the differences will no longer prevent interoperability

2005-12-28T09:35:00.000Z	rinzai-shu	richard	i believe Ubuntu and Debian both have two distinctly different stated goals as distributions, and hence, will not "converge" as you put it any time soon.  course i could be wrong, but i doubt it in this case...
