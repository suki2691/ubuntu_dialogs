2010-05-02T08:51:00.000Z	hypetech	moody	look on the left instead of the right?
2010-05-02T08:51:00.000Z	moody	hypetech	Izinucs : no, the whole bar is gone
2010-05-02T08:52:00.000Z	moody	hypetech	when i choose a next one, it changes the theme, but the window manager is still not there.  no bar, no close button, no max button.
