2007-01-30T12:06:00.000Z	Flannel	Jimb00b	what gave you that idea?
2007-01-30T12:07:00.000Z	Flannel	Jimb00b	oh, wait.  didnt see the nt.  Yeah, that's correct.  exes probably need wine (although,technically not all of them)
2007-01-30T12:07:00.000Z	Flannel	Jimb00b	you, having ubuntu desktop, already have a torrent client, albeit a pretty basic one
