2007-12-28T20:38:00.000Z	larson9999	foo25	when that happened to me it was because i removed myself from a group i shouldn't have.  maybe not your problem though
2007-12-28T20:40:00.000Z	larson9999	foo25	by doing what the topic says to do.
2007-12-28T20:42:00.000Z	larson9999	foo25	oh, that wasn't for you.  how did i resolve that?  i found somewhere online that told me the default groups for unbuntu and added myself to those.
