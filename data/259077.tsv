2004-12-04T10:47:00.000Z	awtcmc		after running dvd shrink in wine, i am now unable to open k3b to burn anything.  i receive the following error:
2004-12-04T10:47:00.000Z	awtcmc		kdecore (KIconLoader): WARNING: Icon directory /usr/share/icons/Smokey-Red/ group 48x48/filesystems not valid.
2004-12-04T10:48:00.000Z	Echramath	awtcmc	It's a warning, not an error, right?
2004-12-04T10:49:00.000Z	Echramath	awtcmc	I suppose that the warning doesn't affect the operation of K3B at all, the problem is somewhere else.
