2008-06-18T07:16:00.000Z	theFATMAN		I need some help guys, apparently photobucket.com was hacked today, and if you visited the site you saw a message from the hackers. Well, I thought it was no big deal, but the site also infected everyone with a redirect virus. Now every site I go to, once I click on a link, it redirects to the same site. I am an ubuntu user, that's why I'm asking here. How can I fix this?
