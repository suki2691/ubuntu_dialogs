2008-02-19T04:19:00.000Z	Exershio		hey everyone, can someone help me? I'm using Envy to install my Radeon 9550 drivers, but with the new drivers (8.02 or 8.01) everything goes very slow (70ish fps in glxgears). with the 8.40 drivers, I get like 2200fps in glxgears, however, with 8.40, I can't use compiz
2008-02-19T04:20:00.000Z	Exershio		Well, with the binary drivers from the Restricted Manager, nothing works
2008-02-19T04:20:00.000Z	Exershio		So I had to use Envy
