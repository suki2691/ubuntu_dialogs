2010-09-18T11:37:00.000Z	maestrojed		My computer locked up and now boots to a bunch of errors and ends in a command line called [initramfs]. Following advice I was going to boot from a cd run fsck. But the CD won't boot. It sites on the purple ubuntu splash screen with the dots showing progress. Any help?
