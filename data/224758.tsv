2005-11-09T13:28:00.000Z	ekimus	FarrisG	none of the amd processors are true 64 bit they still got a 32 bit compatibilty mode, if you want true 64bit you need something like a sparc or similiar
2005-11-09T13:29:00.000Z	FarrisG	ekimus	All I'm really getting at is that I need to know whether it will address ram 64bit wide, and allow single 64bit processes to access greater than 4gb of RAM
2005-11-09T13:30:00.000Z	ekimus	FarrisG	it will, afaik
