2009-03-04T17:42:00.000Z	rhsanbor1		Can anyone recommend the best filesystem to get the most performance out of Samba? I currently have an external hard drive to hold music shares for the house and my laptop backups and it's so slow as to be unusable for that purpose (4.4Mb/s)
2009-03-04T17:42:00.000Z	rhsanbor1		It's going over wireless, but good signals all around, theoretical 54Mb/s, should get at least 20-40Mb/s
2009-03-04T17:43:00.000Z	ziroday	rhsanbor1	so the server is connected via wireless to the router to the wireless computer?
