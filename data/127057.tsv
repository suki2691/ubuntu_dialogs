2011-01-10T02:02:00.000Z	Clockwerks77		Does anyone else have troubles with Vuze not performing a correct search?
2011-01-10T02:03:00.000Z	Clockwerks77		Can anyone help an Ubuntu newb on how to install a tar.bz2 file?
2011-01-10T02:05:00.000Z	vocx	Clockwerks77	a tar.bz2 is not an installable file, it's just an archive (tar) that is compressed (bz2) If you are a newb, you should have no need for it, and you are most probably doing something awkward. What are you doing?
