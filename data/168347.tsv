2006-09-05T13:17:00.000Z	pep100		I am new to this chat thing. If I am doing something wrong please advise. I am trying to configure Dapper on my hp TC1100 tablet. I have the pen working but I cannot get wifi, modem, side buttons, or screen rotation to work?

2006-09-05T13:18:00.000Z	Warbo	pep100	You can do step 1 by looking through "lspci"
2006-09-05T13:20:00.000Z	pep100	Warbo	already done that. the wifi adapter (intel ipw2100 3B) is not listed.
