2008-08-09T04:53:00.000Z	Blaqlight		can I set my nickname to only accept PM's from registered nicks?
2008-08-09T04:54:00.000Z	_jason	Blaqlight	that's default
2008-08-09T04:56:00.000Z	_jason	Blaqlight	if you type '/msg nickserv help' and poke around, you'll find the setting
2008-08-09T04:56:00.000Z	Blaqlight	_jason	if its default then I don't need to mess with it.
