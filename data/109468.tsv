2008-06-16T23:44:00.000Z	snmpee	jrib	oh I do indeed have the ability to read, but if you are going to have a support channel for ubuntu maybe it should be #ubuntu-support and everything offtopic should be in #ubuntu
2008-06-16T23:45:00.000Z	jrib	snmpee	no, and we're offtopic now
2008-06-16T23:45:00.000Z	snmpee	jrib	you're saying i would need to talk about this channel in another channel?
