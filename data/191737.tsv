2009-03-27T08:23:00.000Z	Dei		Hey, I had a question regarding DNS...
2009-03-27T08:24:00.000Z	Dei		I was trying to run a DNS Server to host information for domains I've purchased. Someone told me that it is not allowed to make updates to the Root DNS Records - or something along these lines - and that I shouldn't be doing it this way.
2009-03-27T08:26:00.000Z	Dei		is anyone familiar with BIND that I could speak with?
