2011-10-14T15:00:00.000Z	pureevol		is it possible to switch back to 11.04? or do i have to uninstall ubuntu completely and start completely over?
2011-10-14T15:02:00.000Z	pureevol		im new to ubuntu, only been using it for about a month. by chance did ubuntu make an auto back up and if so how do i find it to revert back to 11.04?
