2007-03-05T14:17:00.000Z	Chocobo		I have a friend who accidently just rm'd his .tex thesis.   Does Ububtu have any tools for inode revocery?
2007-03-05T14:18:00.000Z	ompaul	Chocobo	boot with a live CD and use "the coroners toolkit" that is all the advice one can give
2007-03-05T14:18:00.000Z	Chocobo	ompaul	the Ubuntu live CD?  Does that come with "The coroners toolkit"?
2007-03-05T14:19:00.000Z	ompaul	Chocobo	no idea if it is on there - but it can be downloaded
