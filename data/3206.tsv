2012-05-07T20:16:00.000Z	ano123		i tried unetbootin for installing xubuntu to my netbook, but didnt have much success. first: installation didnt recognize my network (only wifi). secondly it failed and couldnt install after it had made partitions..
2012-05-07T20:17:00.000Z	ano123		i tried using 12 alternate install iso for it
2012-05-07T20:18:00.000Z	ano123		unetbootin doesnt seem to have options for 12LTS, is this issue?
2012-05-07T20:19:00.000Z	u12	ano123	i always check the iso with md5 and use dd to write to the usb , dding is simple
