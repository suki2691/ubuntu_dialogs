2009-04-18T15:00:00.000Z	lstarnes	jelly12gen	some people still use 32-bit processors descended from the x86 family
2009-04-18T15:01:00.000Z	jelly12gen	lstarnes	yeah but they have to upgrade
2009-04-18T15:02:00.000Z	lstarnes	jelly12gen	upgrading is expensive and often not necessary except for some new functionaliy that may not be required for many tasks
