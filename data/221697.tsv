2005-10-29T15:35:00.000Z	frank23	yaaar	I use the mediaplayerconnectivity extension
2005-10-29T15:36:00.000Z	yaaar	frank23	do i install that through synaptic, or go to 'get more extensions' in firefox? also, do you think it'll fight with the totem plugin?
2005-10-29T15:37:00.000Z	frank23	yaaar	in get more extensions. If it doesn't work the first time, reload the page. It doesn't seem to fight with the totem plugin
