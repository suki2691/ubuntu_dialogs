2005-11-03T06:54:00.000Z	BeGu		I have problem adding repositories... I've searched for many sources.list with google but none of them has worked properly....
2005-11-03T06:55:00.000Z	kent	BeGu	how do you meen search for sources.list? use the one you have from default and perhaps add universe and multiverse. Thats all most would ever need..
2005-11-03T06:57:00.000Z	kent	BeGu	then follow this http://help.ubuntu.com/starterguide/C/ch02.html#addinguniverse
2005-11-03T06:57:00.000Z	BeGu	kent	ok, i'll try.. thanks
