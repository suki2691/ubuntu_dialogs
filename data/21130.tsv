2010-12-30T18:09:00.000Z	shn^		I'm completely new at this, but.. I just installed ubuntu server, and a teamspeak server at that. Everything works like a charm; the problem is, and this is probably the most newbie-ish question ever.. How do I return to the commandline without shutting down the server? CTRL+C completely quits teamspeak.

2010-12-30T18:12:00.000Z	shn^	icarus-c	Would you recommend tmux over screen?
