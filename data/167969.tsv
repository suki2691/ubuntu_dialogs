2006-09-16T15:09:00.000Z	slimz		hi i just installed ubuntu in vmware on my windows machine, wich is a pentium 4 3.0 with 512 megs ddr400, and its running really slow, is this because of vmware?
2006-09-16T15:10:00.000Z	Andrew67	slimz	the 2 times i tried vmware, yes it was really slow
2006-09-16T15:10:00.000Z	slimz	Andrew67	: so if i install ubuntu, and then install windows xp in vmware on ubuntu, will i still have the same slow speeds?
2006-09-16T15:11:00.000Z	Andrew67	slimz	probably, im using qemu + kqemu instead, perhaps i just configured vmware wrong, who knows
