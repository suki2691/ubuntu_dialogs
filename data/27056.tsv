2010-10-11T09:24:00.000Z	shig		Hello, Ctrl+Alt+D is not working anymore in Ubuntu 10.10. How can I enable this shortcut again?
2010-10-11T09:25:00.000Z	netcitizen	shig	I configured the keyboard shortcuts with the super button( win key in my laptop) it works like charm
2010-10-11T09:26:00.000Z	shig	netcitizen	whoa, it seems they changed to Super+D as default... good to know, thanks!
