2008-05-21T13:22:00.000Z	HappyHater		I need some help, I'm trying to extract an archive, I keep getting errors telling me I need to start at a previous volume, but I tried the .r00 file and it gives the same error
2008-05-21T13:24:00.000Z	Slart	HappyHater	start at the .rar volume if there is one of those
2008-05-21T13:25:00.000Z	Slart	HappyHater	then you need to ask the person that created the archive
2008-05-21T13:25:00.000Z	Slart	HappyHater	there isn't a sfv-file?
