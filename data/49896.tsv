2009-08-22T18:11:00.000Z	joaopinto	tjc	I have an atheros, I am using ath5k from the backports package, I can randomly connect :P
2009-08-22T18:15:00.000Z	joaopinto	tjc	did you search on launchpad for bugreports ? Sometimes you can find workarounds there
2009-08-22T18:16:00.000Z	tjc	joaopinto	yes, the only hint i found was to change the timeout variable in /etc/wpa_supplicant/functions.sh ( i've changed it to rather high - 60s ), it's apparently worked for somebody.
