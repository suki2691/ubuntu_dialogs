2008-06-03T03:45:00.000Z	STSX	Noxix	That's great! So what was the "silver bullet" that got it going?
2008-06-03T03:46:00.000Z	Noxix	STSX	I thought you gave me a link with a very good tutorial on how to get the card working. Or maybe I found that later. Eitherway, i have a great link that has the info on how to make it happen. Takes for ever though.
2008-06-03T03:47:00.000Z	STSX	Noxix	Well as long as it's working, that's all that matters. :)
