2008-02-06T00:25:00.000Z	Codenut		I just tried to upgrade from fiesty to gutsy and it told me I have not enabled ¨universe¨ to get 3rd party files. How do I enable them.
2008-02-06T00:27:00.000Z	Codenut		Could it be unsupport updates, also called fiesty backports?

2008-02-06T00:28:00.000Z	danand_	Codenut	- synaptics is probably easier way
