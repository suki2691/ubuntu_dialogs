2007-08-06T06:00:00.000Z	ryaren		pls help! When I install nvidia 9639 driver and I reboot the system it loads 7184 Nvidia kernel module and my X doesn't start!! But I don't understand why!?
2007-08-06T06:01:00.000Z	opop	ryaren	because you're using the nvidia installer package instead of the supported version
2007-08-06T06:02:00.000Z	opop		i'm thinking about reinstalling gentoo
2007-08-06T06:03:00.000Z	ryaren	opop	I don't understand you. In the past I successfully installed this nvidia driver from *.runpackage
