2010-05-24T22:45:00.000Z	NightlyUser	livingdaylight	i use a lexmark printer and i needed to install libstdc++5 which isn't in 10.04 repos
2010-05-24T22:45:00.000Z	livingdaylight		is anyone aware of Lucid Lynx requiring certain packages to be installed for printers to be detected like it used to?
2010-05-24T22:46:00.000Z	livingdaylight	NightlyUser	my old epson 425 has been detected and installed on many ubuntu releases. Lucid Lynx is the first release nto to detect and install the drivers
2010-05-24T22:47:00.000Z	NightlyUser	livingdaylight	then i suggest you find out why by checking what it requires in the openprinting site
