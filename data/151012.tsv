2007-01-26T10:21:00.000Z	nrdb		I am trying to compile blender, it says I am missing GL/gl.h, I believe this is to do with opengl, does any know which package I need to install to get this file ?

2007-01-26T10:24:00.000Z	nrdb	ardchoille42	the package didn't run correctly, I thought I would go for the source to see if I had better luck.
2007-01-26T10:24:00.000Z	ardchoille42	nrdb	Ah, yeah, ok
