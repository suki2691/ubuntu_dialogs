2007-01-03T13:51:00.000Z	Wavesonics		thanks toulouse
2007-01-03T13:52:00.000Z	Wavesonics		I got Beryl working before, but when I installed my FireGL drivers, I started using dual head display, and now Beryl crashes
2007-01-03T13:53:00.000Z	Polysics	Wavesonics	my personal opinion is that compiz-freedesktop is far superior to beryl
