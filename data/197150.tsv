2008-07-07T03:16:00.000Z	bobertdos	mister7292	a little bit, what do you need?
2008-07-07T03:18:00.000Z	bobertdos	mister7292	Were you using XP drivers?
2008-07-07T03:25:00.000Z	bobertdos	mister7292	Yes, switching kernels could have very well caused problems. For future wireless NIC installations, I would use ndis-gtk. It streamlines the process quite a bit. For the time being though, I'd say the system probably isn't liking having two sets of drivers installed on top of each other. I don't know of a way to remove old versions.
