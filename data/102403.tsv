2010-02-04T09:13:00.000Z	james_		here's a random one... when you right click on a picture and choose "set as background", where does that picture get saved to?
2010-02-04T09:14:00.000Z	james_		sorry, picture from the internet
2010-02-04T09:15:00.000Z	rww	james_	I just tried it, looks like it ended up in "Firefox_wallpaper.png" in my home folder
