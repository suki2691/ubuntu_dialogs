2007-05-01T10:22:00.000Z	Tormentor		Sorry, PC crashed.
2007-05-01T10:24:00.000Z	Tormentor		Question was, on Ubu 6.10 I had my 2nd HD mounted by editing my etc/fstab file, and it worked properly (Mount point and such) now on 7.04 it just shows a "11.8 GB Volume" on the "Computer" Window. How can I solve that and change it to the way it was on 6.10?
