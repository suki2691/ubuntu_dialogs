2011-12-31T02:36:00.000Z	Melissa2012		<iceroot> Melissa2012: 32bit supports 4gb memory  <--- can someone confirm this please?  because I was told 32bit Ubuntu or 32 bit Windows cannot use the full 4GB ram
2011-12-31T02:37:00.000Z	Melissa2012		so if thats the case, then why do I need the 64bit Ubuntu seeing I only have 4GB ram?
2011-12-31T02:38:00.000Z	AlanBell	Melissa2012	both will work fine, if I were you I would go for 64 bit
2011-12-31T02:39:00.000Z	Melissa2012	AlanBell	but I only have 4GB ram, so installing the 64bit Ubuntu over 32bit apparently wont make a difference
