2007-12-23T21:47:00.000Z	vleon		im out of ideas, i installed the latest catalyst driver, ad 7.11 wich worked fine with a good xorg.conf (my manual configuration) and both composite and aiglx worked, now i removed it and installed all the latest kernel updates and on them the catalys 7.12 and it doesnt recognize my resolution 1680x1050 and compiz doesnt seem to work
2007-12-23T21:48:00.000Z	bazhang	vleon	that only works with red hat and suse
2007-12-23T21:54:00.000Z	bazhang	vleon	the 7.12 does not work with ubuntu iirc
2007-12-23T21:54:00.000Z	bazhang	vleon	7.11 worked right? stick with it then
