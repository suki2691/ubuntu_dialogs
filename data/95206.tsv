2010-05-21T07:38:00.000Z	coldboot|home		I just installed Ubuntu 10.4, and in addition to it not booting, just like every other time I've upgrade Ubuntu, it's now hiding the "hibernate" and "suspend" options, without any explanation.
2010-05-21T07:38:00.000Z	coldboot|home		Does anyone know how to re-enable them.
2010-05-21T07:38:00.000Z	coldboot|home		I really like Ubuntu, but making my system unbootable for the last 5 upgrades is retarded...
2010-05-21T07:40:00.000Z	eugene__	coldboot|home	: i agree with you .
