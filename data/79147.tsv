2008-09-26T23:42:00.000Z	darkip		I'm having a problem with running uTorrent in wine, randomly, utorrent suddenly decides it's not going to accept any more connections on the port it's listening on, even though netstat -pl shows the program as still listening on the port. I've asked both the wine and utorrent people and it seems like it must be a ubuntu problem rather than a utorrent/wine one as no-one else seems to be suffering from this problem.
