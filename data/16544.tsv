2011-04-23T23:09:00.000Z	sridhar_		Hi .. I have installed ubuntu  10.10  32bit version on my  laptop .. is this possible to upgrade to 63bit ubuntu without reformatting harddisk and preserve old data ?
2011-04-23T23:10:00.000Z	sridhar_		so i have to download 64bit and install freshly ?

2011-04-23T23:14:00.000Z	HyperShock	sridhar_	I would, because of the pae support in 32bit and also because 64bit libraries can run along side them too
