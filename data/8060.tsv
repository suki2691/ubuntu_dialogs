2011-11-06T23:14:00.000Z	Xeneth		I got a interesting questing.  Writing a paper and trying to think of a way to describe the /dev folder.  Would it be accurate to compare it to Windows device manager?
2011-11-06T23:14:00.000Z	EvilResistance	Xeneth	 no it wouldnt.
2011-11-06T23:15:00.000Z	Xeneth	EvilResistance	then how should it be described?  I only have a mild understanding and the paper is a comparison of Windows and Linux
