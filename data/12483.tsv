2011-10-24T05:06:00.000Z	vivid		is there an environment variable for a users full name? i know $USER for the short login name, but im looking for the full extended name
2011-10-24T05:08:00.000Z	zykotick9	vivid	both $USER and $USERNAME are the same short name... good luck.
2011-10-24T05:09:00.000Z	zykotick9	vivid	perhaps you could get fancy and copy the info out of /etc/passwd?
