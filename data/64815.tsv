2010-03-03T11:09:00.000Z	Filled-Void		Hi all Im on an Ubuntu 9.10 and my Home partition is sort of filling up and I noticed a folder taking 14.4 gb of space. It is under .local/share/gvfs-metadata Im guessing that I should not be deleting this to reclaim space or would it be ok to delete this folder at all ?

2010-03-03T11:13:00.000Z	Filled-Void	ZykoticK9	Thanks Im checking the community wiki and seeing if its ok to remove at the moment :D . I find it odd that one file would take up 14 gb though
2010-03-03T11:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Filled-Void	actually I'm guessing it's 100s or 1000s of files actually
