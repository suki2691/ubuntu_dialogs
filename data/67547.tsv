2009-05-19T08:58:00.000Z	Zombie_Gaz		Anyone have any idea how to remove the "0*$ shell" from the bottom left of my screen profile?
2009-05-19T08:59:00.000Z	cast|lir	Zombie_Gaz	what does the .screenrc line look like?
2009-05-19T09:01:00.000Z	Zombie_Gaz	cast|lir	Er... empty.
2009-05-19T09:02:00.000Z	Zombie_Gaz	cast|lir	I have a .screen-profile directory with a profile file in it.
