If not, what's the simplest way to get a phpmyadmin, mysql, php, apache server set up?  Security is NOT important, its for personal site testing on my LAN.

2007-12-15T05:29:00.000Z	dylan_	macogw	should my `sudo tasksel install lamp-server` be sitting still at 100% progress of installing php5-mysql on a 300KB/s connection with an AMD64 CPU?
