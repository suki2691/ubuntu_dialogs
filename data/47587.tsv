2012-02-27T00:16:00.000Z	wildcard		Yo people, have a very odd question, but here goes.
2012-02-27T00:17:00.000Z	wildcard		My hard drive failed a while back, and I have installed Ubuntu 11.10 on a flash drive for a temporary fix.  I now have a new hard drive, and lost my install disk.  Is tehre  a way I can partition/install Ubuntu from the flash drive?
2012-02-27T00:17:00.000Z	wildcard		Can I use Gparted to reformat the Hard drive from the flash drive?
