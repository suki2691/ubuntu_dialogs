2006-06-04T12:11:00.000Z	avr		hi guys..  i have a flash mp3 player i want to use in ubuntu. i tried mount -t vfat /dev/sda <somedir> and mount -t ntfs, both dont work
2006-06-04T12:11:00.000Z	wastrel	avr	 flash is fat32 isn't it?
2006-06-04T12:12:00.000Z	avr	wastrel	i dont think there's a fat32 option for mount...
2006-06-04T12:12:00.000Z	avr	wastrel	it works in windows though (and properties shows it as 'FAT')
