2007-08-02T13:48:00.000Z	midori		how about, whats the standard size for any linux distro installed on a hard drive?  how much it takes up just on first installl?  (I mainly want to compare ubuntu to fedora install size.  I don't got much spaces. I heard, they say 10 gigs for / partition, well.  i don't got that much.  how big is their install size?)
