2006-08-14T10:30:00.000Z	urmom		sorry but i have never really used ubuntu (fedora user) but what is the reason that everyone likes ubuntu so much as opposed to other distros?
2006-08-14T10:31:00.000Z	urmom		hmm ive been really happy with fedora but as long as ubuntu users are happy then it helps the linux community :P
2006-08-14T10:31:00.000Z	ardchoille	urmom	Ubuntu doesn't make me update so oftem, apt-get blows yum away, I feel Ubuntu is more stable and secure.. but, those are just my opinions (I switched from FC4 to Ubuntu)
