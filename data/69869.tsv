2009-07-11T14:47:00.000Z	nsadmin	diddy	that's the "any address"
2009-07-11T14:48:00.000Z	diddy	nsadmin	What does any address mean? How can I have any address. Isn't that always 127.0.0.1?
2009-07-11T14:48:00.000Z	nsadmin	diddy	for example in some servers you tell it to listen with address 0.0.0.0 and it will hear all addresses bound to the interface
