2009-05-05T03:45:00.000Z	histo	mib_104um42x	if you install using wubi inside of windows or if you dual boot you can still get to windows
2009-05-05T03:49:00.000Z	histo	mib_104um42x	you have the option when yous tart the machine to load ubuntu or windows
2009-05-05T03:50:00.000Z	histo	mib_104um42x	with wubi you don't have to mess with partitioning etc... Then you can remove it later if you don't want it anymore.
