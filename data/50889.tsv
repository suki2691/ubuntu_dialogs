2009-08-07T15:54:00.000Z	HenkdeVries		Is anyone else having mayor issues installing software on a hardy 64 bits system?  I get lots of bzip2 errors when updating. I've cleared the /var/cache/apt dir and also tried with aptitude. I've tried many combinations of sources list lines but it seems the update system is completely corrupt
