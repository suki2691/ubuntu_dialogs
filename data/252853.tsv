2007-09-19T07:54:00.000Z	limp		what is wrong with my command? sudo apt-get php5 --with-gd
2007-09-19T07:54:00.000Z	limp		oh..
2007-09-19T07:54:00.000Z	wastrel	limp	 apt-get install <packagename>     and --with-gd  seems to be a configure option :] 
2007-09-19T07:59:00.000Z	wastrel	limp	 --with-gd  is a configure option, not an apt-get option
