2006-11-11T08:39:00.000Z	rogue780		does anyone know how thunderbird stores e-mail messages? is it in a directory or a database of some sort?
2006-11-11T08:41:00.000Z	rogue780		I'm trying to figure out how to import e-mail messages from another hard drive that used thunderbird to my current setup
2006-11-11T08:41:00.000Z	rogue780		I can still boot the other hard drive, so if anyone knows how to export/import thunderbird messages, that'd be great too.
