2009-05-14T18:35:00.000Z	icedwater	TheLinx	try man curl? There should be some sort of dump option.
2009-05-14T18:35:00.000Z	TheLinx	icedwater	I mean save what the program outputs to a variable
2009-05-14T18:36:00.000Z	icedwater	TheLinx	with that much output, I guess you might want to put it into a file first..
