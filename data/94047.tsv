2008-05-17T20:33:00.000Z	saltedlight		hi. i have a problem with inkscape on ubuntu 8.04. after i have instaled it with add/remove, like usual, it was started only once by another user on this system. now the problem is that _no one_ can start inkscape again on this system, even with root privileges (had to try to be sure). what may be the reason? any sugestions to get it working? please...

Also you can try moving your ~/.inkscape  settings folder to ~/.inkscape.backup to see if that is the problem
