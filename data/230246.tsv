2005-06-29T13:02:00.000Z	Mauve		Hi, I'm having trouble booting from the Hoary Install CD, I keep getting GRUB Error 15 all the time and it will not boot; I have only seen this error when my 250GB disk has been connected... Does anybody have a clue?
2005-06-29T13:04:00.000Z	Seveas	Mauve	weird, are the CD drive and 250GB disk perhaps both SATA?
2005-06-29T13:05:00.000Z	Seveas	Mauve	sounds like a bug in the installer, please make a deatailed report and file it at bugzilla.ubuntu.com
