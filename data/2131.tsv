2012-07-04T12:49:00.000Z	josef__		Hi I hesitate between ubuntu 12.04 and linuxmint 13 cinnamon. It's the same thing for me but which of them is more complete and customizable (for you) ?
2012-07-04T12:49:00.000Z	massdivide	josef__	go with 12.04
2012-07-04T12:52:00.000Z	josef__	massdivide	: what are the positives that mint13 doesn't have ?
2012-07-04T12:53:00.000Z	massdivide	josef__	it what it does have that makes it the problem. Gnome 3 is garbage. Unity while it has its faults, its far superior. personally I dropped them both and just use cairo-dock. but ubuntu has better support and can auto-update.
