2009-05-13T16:10:00.000Z	bullgard4	sacarlson	dmesg shows a line "usbcore: registered new interface driver usbfs" but lsmod does not list usbcore nor usbfs. What is wrong in my thoughts?
2009-05-18T13:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	bullgard4	is it better than ekiga?  does it have video?
2009-05-18T13:41:00.000Z	bullgard4	sacarlson	I do not know yet. I just had a first unsuccessful test using Empathy with another guy.
2011-01-15T09:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	bullgard4	on mine service network restart returns network: unrecognized service ,  but normaly service I think runs the script found in /etc/init.d/network  so if you have that file there you can read what's in it to find out what it does
