2008-02-02T04:53:00.000Z	Sakkath	Sciri	i'm not installing on vmware, i only used it to see if the integrity of the CD was ok. i'm trying to dual boot on my windows system which has the 'bios raid' (i guess that's another form of sw raid?) with nvraid--raid0, can i view my windows files from ubuntu & can i install ok? the main problem is the gfx at the moment
