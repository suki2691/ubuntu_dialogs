2007-09-26T07:51:00.000Z	Vadi		How can I see what kernels do I have installed?
2007-09-26T07:52:00.000Z	murkyMurk	Vadi	read them off the boot list
2007-09-26T07:53:00.000Z	murkyMurk	Vadi	check contents of /usr/src/  beyond that, dunno
2007-09-26T07:54:00.000Z	murkyMurk	Vadi	uname tells u the kernel you are currently using
