2011-01-12T06:23:00.000Z	Haunt_House	bastidrazor	nope, wont work. I guess this works with the bookmarks, But my nautilus doesn't show them. It show file system and home folder only
2011-01-12T06:26:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Haunt_House	right, it does work with the bookmarks .. i don't know how to add them to where you're wanting.
