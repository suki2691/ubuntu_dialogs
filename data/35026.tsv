2010-09-12T20:20:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	Emanon	what do you mean by "jink"?
2010-09-12T20:23:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	Emanon	I'm not sure what you mean. What game updates?
2010-09-12T20:24:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	Emanon	oh those. I turned off facebook on gwibber because I didn't ind it useful enough, but I think you'd have to turn those off on the facebook site
