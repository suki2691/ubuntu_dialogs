2006-01-14T09:55:00.000Z	Ng		but as mika0800 says, almost unsupported, so seriously not worth using
2006-01-14T09:56:00.000Z	Ng		you can't tell your users to use 2.6.10 and an old Gnome ;)
2006-01-14T09:58:00.000Z	mika0800	Ng	exactly. I am a long time Delphi user, so now IO want to use Kylix with Linux. And, with 2.6.10 kernel (or older) and IceWm that seems perfectly possible.
