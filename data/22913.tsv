2010-11-08T20:08:00.000Z	ProblemFTL	FishFace	 ok, ill take chromium from the USC, but it says it wont get updated?
2010-11-08T20:08:00.000Z	FishFace	ProblemFTL	Thats cause it is open source. Chrome is from Google and you get what they give you
2010-11-08T20:09:00.000Z	ProblemFTL	FishFace	 so if i want a newer chromium, ill have to wait till 11.04?
