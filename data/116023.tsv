2008-03-19T04:01:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	antz123	Is vista and ubuntu already installed?
2008-03-19T04:02:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	antz123	Most likely not. But Vista SP1 is still new and I haven't seen or heard much of ubuntu users upgrading.
2008-03-19T04:02:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	antz123	I want to do that myself though... has it been released through microsoft update yet?
