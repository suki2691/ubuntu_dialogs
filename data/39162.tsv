2010-01-16T02:14:00.000Z	acicula	Ostlian_Bryffelk	its possible i guess, but youd have to merge old and new passwd/shadow files and preserve guid/uid
2010-01-16T02:15:00.000Z	acicula	Ostlian_Bryffelk	at least im not aware of an autmated tool for it, so just manual work
2010-01-16T02:15:00.000Z	Ostlian_Bryffelk	acicula	Okay. :/
