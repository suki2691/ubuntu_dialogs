2009-08-31T07:20:00.000Z	jhouse		Are there any special considerations for getting DSL working with ubuntu?  In the past, when I had DSL, I had to install special software with windows.
2009-08-31T07:21:00.000Z	linux	jhouse	are you refering to ATT?

2009-08-31T07:21:00.000Z	linux	jhouse	ATT requires a windows computer to register DSL, then after that, linux works fine, don't know about Verizon (most software is optional for DSl working though on Windows)
