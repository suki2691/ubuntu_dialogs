2008-05-28T21:36:00.000Z	Chuggst3r_		I'm still trying to figure out my graphics issue, where the video card doesn't get recognized anymore...and I'm flipping through the error logs and find this: May 28 00:46:58 nick-desktop kernel: [ 2065.529190] nvidia: module license 'NVIDIA' taints kernel.
2008-05-28T21:36:00.000Z	Chuggst3r_		What exactly does taints kernel mean?
