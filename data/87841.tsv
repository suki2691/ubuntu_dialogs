2008-06-12T10:09:00.000Z	keithclark		Why do I get this error when running gnome-system-monitor via ssh?  SELinux was found but is not enabled.
2008-06-12T10:09:00.000Z	Ketsueki	keithclark	Maybe, because SELinux is installed, but really isn't actually enabled?
2008-06-12T10:10:00.000Z	Ketsueki	keithclark	No idea how to enable it though
2008-06-12T10:10:00.000Z	keithclark	Ketsueki	got you, I'll keep searching
