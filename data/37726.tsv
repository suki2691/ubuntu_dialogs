2011-04-04T22:29:00.000Z	ohsix	maheanuu	you have a mime type problem
2011-04-04T22:29:00.000Z	ohsix	maheanuu	you picked "folder" to only open with media player, you can do it again and set it back to nautilus
2011-04-04T22:30:00.000Z	ohsix	maheanuu	theres also a file you can edit but i can't remember the name
