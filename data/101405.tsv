2008-02-19T00:27:00.000Z	LUISLO_		My intention is not to start a flame war... but rather get arguments against suse (coz I have so many but I want to hear more)... one of my strongest is a dependencies hell! but why is ubuntu better than suse?
2008-02-19T00:29:00.000Z	LUISLO_		Odd-rationale... I guess I've been used to rpm... but like i said is a "dependencies hell"
2008-02-19T00:30:00.000Z	Lettuc3	LUISLO_	the only way to find out what distro you feel more at ease using, is to try them out, that's fairly easy these days, becauase they all have liveCDs... however, you probably do need a decent internet connection.
2008-02-19T00:34:00.000Z	Lettuc3	LUISLO_	im not entirely sure, but i think pclinuxos uses synaptic with rpm. i dont know if that resolves your dependency problems though. this is a little offtopic, though, if you want to carry on, you should probably consider #ubuntu-offtopic.
