2005-12-11T10:04:00.000Z	cratuki		For some reason my ls order is different under ubuntu than on my debian stable host
2005-12-11T10:05:00.000Z	cratuki		Does anyone know what causes ls to order like that?
2005-12-11T10:06:00.000Z	bimberi	cratuki	is ls aliased with some additional options? try "alias ls" to see
2005-12-11T10:07:00.000Z	bimberi	cratuki	check on debain too :)
