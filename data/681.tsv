2012-10-25T03:53:00.000Z	h6w		Hi.  How do I report an ubuntu bug now?   Clicking on "report a bug" on launchpad keeps sending me to a "Bug reporting etiquette" page on ubuntu.com
2012-10-25T03:55:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	h6w	is this the page you get sent to? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs If so, the steps are near the bottom.
2012-10-25T03:56:00.000Z	h6w	trism	Yeah.  This is an upgrading bug, tho.  So what package would that be?
2012-10-25T03:57:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	h6w	if it has a window that you can open, use ubuntu-bug -w and pick that window.
