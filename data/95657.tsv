2008-04-13T01:15:00.000Z	binarical-app	didy	: you will run into conflicts if you apt-get you kde system from ubuntu
2008-04-13T01:16:00.000Z	binarical-app	didy	even if you folow the ubuntu forums to remove gnome based ... apps, your system will bug up
2008-04-13T01:17:00.000Z	binarical-app	didy	i really would sujest getting the kubuntu cd and either upgrading your current system or, reinstalling it after backing up your "want to save" files
