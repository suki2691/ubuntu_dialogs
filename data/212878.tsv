2006-01-16T07:37:00.000Z	gnomefreak	afonit	more than likely they are using suse
2006-01-16T07:38:00.000Z	afonit	gnomefreak	 they have the ubuntu logo next to 'applications' on the menu
2006-01-16T07:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	afonit	ok than maybe they are :) now you know ubuntu is better than suse if suse users are using ubuntu :))
