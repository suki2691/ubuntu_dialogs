2004-09-29T07:41:00.000Z	Robar		I have a question about root access, anyone around?
2004-09-29T07:43:00.000Z	Robar		Just wondering... I noticed I never setup a root password during the install. I know I can do 'sudo passwd root' to set one, but is this okay to do? Or is there a reason that the Ubuntu devs decided to leave that out?
2004-09-29T07:43:00.000Z	Robar		I don't really understand the distinction...
2004-09-29T07:43:00.000Z	mdz	Robar	that's perfectly fine to do if you want
