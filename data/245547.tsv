2005-08-10T09:51:00.000Z	sproingie	ChurcH_of_FoamY	yes, it will be busted until release
2005-08-10T09:51:00.000Z	sproingie	ChurcH_of_FoamY	that's development for you.  even breezy debs don't track every package on breezy, just whatever they work on
2005-08-10T09:52:00.000Z	sproingie	ChurcH_of_FoamY	actually i can't speak for breezy devs, but that does describe DD's
