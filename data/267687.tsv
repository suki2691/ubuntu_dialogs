2005-09-17T06:29:00.000Z	nickv111		Maybe I should use 5.04 then
2005-09-17T06:29:00.000Z	xTina	nickv111	I consider it stable :)
2005-09-17T06:30:00.000Z	xTina	nickv111	It's been working a lot better for me than hoary. But I'm the person who managed to hit any bug that was there in hoary in the past few weeks ;)
