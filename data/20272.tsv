2011-01-16T21:34:00.000Z	drahx_	merma	did you select it in Preferences>Sound?
2011-01-16T21:35:00.000Z	merma	drahx_	It is not appearing in the output devices available
2011-01-16T21:36:00.000Z	drahx_	merma	Mine showed up after installing the drivers from ATI"s website, did you try the drivers from Nvidia, or are you using the ones from "Additional Drivers"?
