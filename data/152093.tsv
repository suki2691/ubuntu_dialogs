2008-02-09T10:47:00.000Z	adorablepuppy		I've had this problem since Feisty and still have it in Gutsy. My Templates aren't registering in the "Create New" context menu. I'm not imagining it, I've got a document in there, but it still tells me I've got no templates installed. Anyone have any idea what would cause it?
