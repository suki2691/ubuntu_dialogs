2008-01-10T00:02:00.000Z	KlrSpz	silverphoenix	no.. it's just a kernel and a userspace; you build the packages by hand or implement your own package manager of choice
2008-01-10T00:03:00.000Z	silverphoenix	KlrSpz	ok, does it have a support channel?
2008-01-10T00:03:00.000Z	KlrSpz	silverphoenix	umm.. dunno... never looked :S
