2010-07-07T19:07:00.000Z	mleger		Hello all, I was wondering if anyone can recommend a good backup utility so that I may backup my system automatically on a schedule to an external HD. Something along the lines of ghosting utilities or time capsule would be great!

2010-07-07T19:08:00.000Z	mleger	ve2dmn	I'll take a look at that as well, thank you! Does anyone have a program that they currently use and recommend?
