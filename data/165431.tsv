2006-10-04T16:24:00.000Z	ReservoirGods		Hello all, I am trying to get a tv tuner card to work, forums helped just about enough to get the tuner working. can see a very good picture. but no sound.

2006-10-04T16:28:00.000Z	rockerichtig	ReservoirGods	maybe the soundcard inline is muted or your TV tool uses to wrong engine
2006-10-04T16:29:00.000Z	ReservoirGods	rockerichtig	see for yourself. I cant understand much of the dmesg output. but i suspect something about the audio is missing here :S
