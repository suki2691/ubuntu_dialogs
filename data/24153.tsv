2012-02-28T09:53:00.000Z	stiltzkin	KM0201	me? Trying to mount an encrypted LUKS partition properly. It's not really a big deal now since I already have Nautilus running the copy as root. I just didn't want to resort to that.
2012-02-28T09:53:00.000Z	KM0201	stiltzkin	hmm, yeah, and running nautilus as root is kinda nasty anyway
2012-02-28T09:54:00.000Z	stiltzkin	KM0201	sacarlson, don't worry about it, as long as I can back my data up this installation is getting nuked anyway.
