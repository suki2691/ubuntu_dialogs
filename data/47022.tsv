2009-09-24T23:25:00.000Z	sburwood		I use Ubuntu 8.10.  I use Thunderbird as an e-mail client.  While Thunderbird worked in the past correctly, now, each and every time I use it, it asks me for the e-mail addresses, etc.  Why?
2009-09-24T23:25:00.000Z	sburwood		and what to do?
2009-09-24T23:27:00.000Z	sburwood		anyone wanna help me?
