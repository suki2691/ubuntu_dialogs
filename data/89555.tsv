2008-05-27T00:07:00.000Z	prash81		Hey all, I'm trying to install ubuntu, and I have Windows XP already installed.  Does the Ubuntu install disk allow us to format the Hard Drive, or is there anything I have to do?

2008-05-27T00:08:00.000Z	prash81	BCM43	I tried to install, but it just locks up, does it auto format?
2008-05-27T00:08:00.000Z	BCM43	prash81	yes
