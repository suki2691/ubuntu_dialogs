2007-08-20T08:23:00.000Z	oompaloompa	xubu	u might get away with mounting it with the force option
2007-08-20T08:23:00.000Z	oompaloompa	xubu	sudo mount -f /dev/blahblah
2007-08-20T08:24:00.000Z	oompaloompa	xubu	if it won't then u just have to boot into windows, let it rucn chkdisk, when it is done, reboot into windows, it will mark the filesystem as clean, then it should be ok
