2008-09-18T02:22:00.000Z	kabads	tonyyarusso	this device automounts - how would I change it?
2008-09-18T02:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	kabads	hrm...  Well, if need be you could umount it and remount manually, or create an fstab entry
2008-09-18T02:24:00.000Z	kabads	tonyyarusso	thanks - I suppose that will help debug
