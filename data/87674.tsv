2008-06-27T23:40:00.000Z	asmo[B]	david123	the only way it would get onto the windows machine is if you didn't have a good anti-virus for the windows machine... it's not going to run in unbuntu so it's not really going to be able to do what it does to spread unless you move it to that windows machine really...
