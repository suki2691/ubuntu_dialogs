2009-06-01T16:27:00.000Z	felix__	koshari	G_A_C it has a legacy driver. one free and one privative, from nvidia site, i tryed but hw manager didnt recognise neither
2009-06-01T16:27:00.000Z	koshari	felix__	you would have to manually install that package i suspect
2009-06-01T16:29:00.000Z	felix__	koshari	i did. it is nvidia*71* or smthing like that. i installed all packages that includes a 71 but hw manager stillsaying that no hw is found and so i cant enable the use of privativa. lshw detects the card
