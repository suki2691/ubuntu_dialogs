2010-05-10T01:12:00.000Z	TannerF		What does it do?
2010-05-10T01:12:00.000Z	guntbert	TannerF	no, wubi is for installing ubuntu in "file" in windows, dual boot means you choose upon booting what OS to use
2010-05-10T01:14:00.000Z	guntbert	TannerF	many supporters here do advise to not use wubi - I have no experience with it
