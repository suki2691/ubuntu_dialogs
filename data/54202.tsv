2009-08-21T16:48:00.000Z	zetheroo1		I have an external USB HDD and a friend wants to borrow it to copy some stuff off of it ... I would like to make it so that he can only access the one folder and not the others .... is there a way to do that?

2009-08-21T16:51:00.000Z	zetheroo1	Draglor	I have heard of it ... but thought it was more for encrypting volumes ... can it lock a folder?
