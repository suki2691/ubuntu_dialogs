2010-07-12T11:05:00.000Z	mltngclk		im having trouble installing flash 10 in ubuntu 8.04. ive tried the tar file, the deb...no luck, it will say it installs and will even list itself as installed such as synaptic, but no flash, and in firefox it doesnt list it in about:plugins....im considering going back to 9, but I can't find a link for that package
2010-07-12T11:06:00.000Z	Catwoman	mltngclk	try adobe site or gnash
2010-07-12T11:08:00.000Z	Catwoman	mltngclk	gnash mixed experiences...adobe 9 may be the answer
2010-07-12T11:09:00.000Z	mltngclk	Catwoman	hopefully so
