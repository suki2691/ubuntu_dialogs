2007-06-12T09:45:00.000Z	reanjr	eggs	over what size?
2007-06-12T09:48:00.000Z	reanjr	eggs	you could use du -h | grep "^[0-9] [0-9] [0-9] M" followed by du -h | grep "^...G"  probably a better way but that would work
2007-06-12T09:50:00.000Z	reanjr	eggs	actually that second part is wrong: ... | grep "^[^ ] G"
