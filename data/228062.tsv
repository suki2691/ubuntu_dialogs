2005-07-20T12:11:00.000Z	Heimdall_linux		oh okay
2005-07-20T12:11:00.000Z	Heimdall_linux		looks like I won't find help in here :-/
2005-07-20T12:12:00.000Z	crimsun	Heimdall_linux	you'll probably have better luck in a gnuplot-specific channel
2005-07-20T12:13:00.000Z	Heimdall_linux	crimsun	yeah it was part of my first question, 'is there a channel for gnuplot ?' but it looks like there is no channel...
