2010-01-09T02:00:00.000Z	scott_ino2	night_fox1	if you do cd /etc/modprobe.d and then type ls it should tell you what you have in there, if it's not in there then im guessing you nee something else
2010-01-09T02:02:00.000Z	night_fox1	scott_ino2	Its not there. I'm guessing theres some equivalent somewhere?
