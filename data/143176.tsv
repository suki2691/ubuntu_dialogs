2007-10-31T15:22:00.000Z	gerro		I have this huge 1gb file with a random name and no clue what it is, how can I find out? I don't want to open the entire thing in a hex editor maybe just the header
2007-10-31T15:22:00.000Z	cast	gerro	file randomname
2007-10-31T15:22:00.000Z	gerro	cast	thanks forgot about that
2007-10-31T15:23:00.000Z	cast	gerro	you don't have to open the whole thing anyway, you can just look at the first few hundred bytes with head
