I can't get beryl to startup automatically with sessions, I can't get quicktime or one other kind of internet stream to work (wma? or something) though I did get flash to work and that made me proud, and I still can't enable and disable my touchpad at will despite adding the line to xorg.conf that was supposed to allow me to do that
2007-04-16T14:27:00.000Z	__hase		uh, so should I get feisty instead of edgy?  I hadn't used Linux in three years when I got my own computer again, edgy seemed the way to go
2007-04-16T14:27:00.000Z	__hase		hmm
