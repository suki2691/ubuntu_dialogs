2011-10-28T12:48:00.000Z	warm		Hi, I am using Update Manager to install updates, but there is 2 lib-like packages not found on the source server, and it would't install those software not related to the missing packages. How to install them?
2011-10-28T12:50:00.000Z	gucki	warm	did you try doing a "sudo apt-get -f install"?
2011-10-28T12:51:00.000Z	warm	gucki	it doesn't work either
2011-10-28T12:52:00.000Z	warm	gucki	I mean to install those already downloaded packages. almost 90
