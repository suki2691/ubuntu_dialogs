2006-03-28T13:17:00.000Z	toxic_	crimsun	hehe np :P By the way, you wouldn't have a clue why I can't get acpi to trigger on events (I've modprobed most of the modules in .../kernel/drivers). Events worked fresh from the box, but then I had a kernelupdate to 2.6.12.10 and it seemed that it stopped working somewhere along that time.

2006-03-28T13:21:00.000Z	toxic_	crimsun	ok thx anyway
