By default, asoundconf's configuration file is ~/.asoundrc.asoundconf and must be included in ~/.asoundrc. Open this file to make sure it is!" I don't understand what it wants me to do?

2009-04-11T13:10:00.000Z	BlackDalek	bluejeans	I looked at that file and .asoundrc.asoundconf is not mentioned anywhere. I don't know what it wants me to type into the file.
