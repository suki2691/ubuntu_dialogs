2007-05-26T13:21:00.000Z	Click64bit		anyone wanna help a linux newb figure some things out?
2007-05-26T13:21:00.000Z	Click64bit		well I need to install flash plug in, but it says it doesn't support 64bit
2007-05-26T13:22:00.000Z	Click64bit		also I have 2 monitors, I want to run dual screens - at startup it comes on both, now only one one - I am using the nvidia "restricted driver"
