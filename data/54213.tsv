2009-06-25T08:36:00.000Z	lf4	mdg	Thanks I just figured it out that I set the keybindings to none in the .screen-prfiles/keybindings file.
2009-06-25T08:38:00.000Z	mdg	lf4	cool.  How did you set that bindkey up? (out of curiosity)
2009-06-25T08:39:00.000Z	lf4	mdg	I was messing around with the menu and noticed there was a section to disable all bind keys which is what I wanted. I am not use to screen having bind keys besides the standard ^ ones.
