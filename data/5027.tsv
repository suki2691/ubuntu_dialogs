2012-03-02T09:33:00.000Z	Rakyth		Is there a way to get gparted on a Windows machine without the boot disk?
2012-03-02T09:34:00.000Z	Rakyth		Also; how would I make a dual boot setup with Ubuntu 11.04 and Windows 7? I'm assuming I just setup a seperate partition for each and install each OS into those.
