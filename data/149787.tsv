2008-04-24T22:56:00.000Z	Wyleyrabbit		I have an Athlon64 X2 CPU with ~ 3.25 GB of RAM. Should I be using the AMD64 version of Ubuntu? Will I get better performance?
2008-04-24T22:57:00.000Z	Wyleyrabbit		will I have problems with the AMD64 version with a lack of available packages, etc? Or is that issue pretty much solved?
2008-04-24T22:58:00.000Z	Pici	Wyleyrabbit	There are still some issues, such as java and wine
2008-04-24T23:04:00.000Z	Pici	Wyleyrabbit	Only if you have the alternate CD
