2008-07-29T21:32:00.000Z	Hexxeh		Hello
2008-07-29T21:32:00.000Z	Hexxeh		I installed 8.04 last night on a fairly old box, and upon booting it up again this morning, GRUB threw me an error 18. So I reinstalled grub, shut down the box, and just started it up again, and it's reappeared.
2008-07-29T21:33:00.000Z	Hexxeh		How can I permanantly fix this error?
2008-07-29T21:33:00.000Z	DRebellion	Hexxeh	I think a good start would be to figure out what "error 18" corresponds to.
