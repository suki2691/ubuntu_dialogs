2008-01-12T16:09:00.000Z	Emof		I just installed KDE 4 on my Ubuntu 7.10 and it seems very "buggy". Everything is kind of slow, and the background doesn't load by itself, and the fonts are kind of hard to read. I usually run compiz-fusion/gnome without any trouble so I'm wondering if I might have done something wrong. But since installing it was just a matter of apt-get install kde4-core I'm not sure what could have gone wrong
2008-01-12T16:09:00.000Z	Emof		I just wanted to try it out

2008-01-12T16:11:00.000Z	a4ndr3c	Emof	oh.. sorry but still is very new, maybe it need perfomance tweaks, wait and try it later :P
