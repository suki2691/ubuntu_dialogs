2005-02-27T07:13:00.000Z	setite		can someone help me share my entire PC
2005-02-27T07:13:00.000Z	setite		nothing you would want... basic windows and linux with some mp3s
2005-02-27T07:13:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	setite	I'd rethink about doing that, really
2005-02-27T07:15:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	setite	can't help you there. I'd think it's faster to just walk copy the harddisk and place the harddisk in the other pc.
