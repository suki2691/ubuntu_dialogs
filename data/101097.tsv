2008-02-15T16:21:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	maximilion	good point... a regular user like me couldn't see the use for 9 buttons though =p
2008-02-15T16:22:00.000Z	maximilion	speedhunt3r	well those mice rock in browsers too... 2-directional scroll wheel, home/end to go all the way up and down, middle click to open link in new tab, one button to save link as... the options are endless
