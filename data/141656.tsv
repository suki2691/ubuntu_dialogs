2007-04-20T15:10:00.000Z	vimalg2		Can anyone tell me if there is a command-line switch or some hack/workaround that allows APT-GET to resume broken downloads? I cannot stress this enough because my ISP only provides dial-up in my area. I've been trying to download Eclipse from the repositories for a very long time. Please help!
