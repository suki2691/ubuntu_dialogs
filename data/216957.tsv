2006-03-20T09:03:00.000Z	jadaz87_		should i enable all of them that are for my ubuntu edition?
2006-03-20T09:03:00.000Z	_jason	jadaz87_	main restricted universe multiverse are typical
2006-03-20T09:04:00.000Z	_jason	jadaz87_	making a new /etc/apt/sources.list with that link the bot gave you is the easiest way imo
