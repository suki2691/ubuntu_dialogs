2008-11-02T23:11:00.000Z	pozican	MnemonicPunk	hrm, if I use X -configure to generate one, will I be able to enable nvidia via the gui? I really don't feel like figuring video card drivers out today
2008-11-02T23:12:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	pozican	If you get X running, you should be able to install it with the GUI, yes. Seems to be a bit buggy for some nvidia cards right now, though.
