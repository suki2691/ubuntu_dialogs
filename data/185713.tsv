2006-07-19T14:56:00.000Z	WhatTheDeuce		Hello.  Is there any tool I could use inside Ubuntu to shrink another partition on the hard drive (my Windows partition) without loosing data?

2006-07-19T15:03:00.000Z	WhatTheDeuce	Warbo	gparted isn't letting me do anything to the Windows partition except delete it.  What could cause this?
