2007-10-04T13:34:00.000Z	duffyd		hi, I've just updated my kernel for my edgy distro to 2.6.17-12 and I'm having problems with my ipw3945 interface
2007-10-04T13:34:00.000Z	duffyd		anyone else experienced problems with the ipw3945?
2007-10-04T13:35:00.000Z	duffyd		basically it seems to associate with the AP fine but then as traffic starts to pass through the interface it de-associates (if there is such a word ;)
2007-10-04T13:36:00.000Z	it-linux	duffyd	| I try on search in my ubuntu, there's no such thing like ipw3945?
