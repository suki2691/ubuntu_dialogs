2005-09-27T08:41:00.000Z	Tomcat_	shtron	In /etc/modules? Afaik you need to blacklist it in the hotplug config
2005-09-27T08:42:00.000Z	Tomcat_	shtron	I'm not sure how exactly you blacklist something in /etc/modules, but there's a file and directory /etc/hotplug/blacklist*
2005-09-27T08:42:00.000Z	Tomcat_	shtron	Yes but how did you blacklist it?
