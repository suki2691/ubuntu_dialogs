2008-10-01T21:42:00.000Z	Revan		Ok...I have read through the rsync man page...Any other tips? Like for instance, should I put a bunch of rsync commands in a script file and schedule it to be run every day? Or is there another tool I should use with it? (This is with regards to performing reliable backups of data)
