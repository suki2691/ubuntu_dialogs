2007-04-17T09:02:00.000Z	Anunnaki		Hey guys, I tried Ubuntu for the first time earlier on a live CD and I was having problems with the display; I'm on a laptop right now and have a separate monitor hooked up to it. When Ubuntu booted up, the edges were all messed up (text looked squished and some went beyond the border) even though the monitor was aligned correctly. Does anyone know what was wrong?
