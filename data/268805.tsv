2005-07-26T11:22:00.000Z	Shicaca		Question: I have a laptop (Gateway Solo 1450 if you're interested) that has ACPI fans. I found a "script" that can turn the fans on and off. It gives me the code but what do I write the code in? Is there a program? I'm so freaking green with Linux it's not even funny, but before I can install it on my laptop for real (I was using Live) I have to get the fans to turn off/on.
