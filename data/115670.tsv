2008-09-07T12:48:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest		Hi! I have a NVIDIA 8800 GTS but Im hjaving problems with refreshrates! My monitor runs @ 60 HZ but the NVIDIA-card @ 59.95 and that looks pretty bad.... but can I fix this?
2008-09-07T12:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	NorthByNorthWest	 how are you even telling these rates?  I got an 8800gtsxxx and have no issues.  I thought the 60 was just a rounded up #
2008-09-07T12:50:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	dr_willis	my monitor meny says 60 Hz, NVIDIA X server setup says 59.95 Hz, and dragging windows aroud gives nasty scanlines
2008-09-07T12:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	NorthByNorthWest	 Im thinking you may be looking at the wrong place for your problems..  You may want to check the forums.  it could be some other config issue.
