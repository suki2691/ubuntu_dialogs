2011-06-26T14:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	leo_	 try making a new user, see if the issue affects them as well.
2011-06-26T14:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	leo_	 use the terminal...    wine /path/to/whatever.exe   is the easy way to get around that
2011-06-26T14:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	leo_	 or copy the file to your home dir. and make it 'executable'
