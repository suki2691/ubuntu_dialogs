2007-06-17T07:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Toshibi	 ive never seven SEEN a sata optical drive.  the makers just dont seem to want to put a lot of them ouyt in stores yet.
2007-06-17T07:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Toshibi	 sounds very cutting edge. :) may be so new that it dident follow some standards.  What brand is this anyway?
