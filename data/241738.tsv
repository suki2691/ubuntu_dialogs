2005-04-17T12:44:00.000Z	airco_		i'm trying to get my windows partitions mounted under ubuntu but i keep getting 'mount: /dev/hda1 already mounted or /mnt/windows busy', though i'm very sure the device isn't mounted and the dir isn't busy.  does anyone have any ideas what could be going on, or pointers to where i might find more info?
