2010-09-24T11:32:00.000Z	Samual		I have an issue with Compiz Fusion --- After about two hours after running it, it becomes extremely slow (To the point of like 1 frame per second) making it almost useless/unresponsive
2010-09-24T11:32:00.000Z	Samual		The time seems random
2010-09-24T11:34:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Samual	try running  top  in a console and use  <  and   >  to change which columns to sort by. look for what's using all the cpu
2010-09-24T11:34:00.000Z	Samual	Seven_Six_Two	i've already watched it with htop a lot -- Nothing changes
