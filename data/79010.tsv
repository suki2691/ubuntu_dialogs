2008-09-18T08:00:00.000Z	Dragondef	bobertdos	Well, I have been able to move a java development onto another drive, and I was hoping that I could do the same. I am just running out of hard drive (2g) and have a 250g External
2008-09-18T08:02:00.000Z	bobertdos	Dragondef	Well, if you did it with the JDK, I guess you already know how careful you have to be. Just know that not all programs (and more importantly, they're dependencies) are as easily relocated.
