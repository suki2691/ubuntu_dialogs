2012-05-26T19:31:00.000Z	ubuntuuser1110		Hi, I'm running Ubuntu 11.10 and for some reason 12.04 doesn't show up in Update Manager.  I have the settings set to notify me of all updates.
2012-05-26T19:33:00.000Z	ubuntuuser1110		I didn't see this under known issues.
2012-05-26T19:33:00.000Z	theixle	ubuntuuser1110	Have you tried running update-manager -d ?
2012-05-26T19:34:00.000Z	ubuntuuser1110	theixle	update-manager -d did it.  Thanks!
