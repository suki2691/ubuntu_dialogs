2011-09-13T09:57:00.000Z	maheanuu		I have a question about wifi routers and don't know where to ask
2011-09-13T09:59:00.000Z	maheanuu		I have my router set up and I have 2 young school age children who have access and I need to limit their access speeds as they are taking all my bandwidth

2011-09-13T10:01:00.000Z	maheanuu	Besogon	  What I would like to do is limit them to about 50Kbps as it is I only have 270K here and they are syphoning all of it
