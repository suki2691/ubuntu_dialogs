2007-02-11T16:04:00.000Z	VividHazE		hey can anyone help me its really simple but i'm stupid. I'm trying to change permissions on my scanner so I can use it, its already setup, I found instructions to find out what number to put at the end of this: sudo chmod a+w /dev/bus/usb/001/002 but it was for Ubuntu not Kubuntu which I have and I can't figure it out
2007-02-11T16:04:00.000Z	VividHazE		is there a command I can put in to find out, or someone tell me the menu in kubuntu to go to?
