All CPUs are made in specific form factors to fit into different sockets. Most Pentium 4 processors were made for Socket 478 or 478B sockets, which mean they have 478 pins on a chip roughly an inch and a quarter square. The high number of pins allow more signals and data to be passed simultaneously to the motherboard, one way the sp

The lesser number of pins were aligned in six concentric rows with a blank central square. Pentium II and even older Celerons used Socket 7 and any of a half dozen other schemes and were often put on daughtercards to make them somewhat interchangeable. It would be like trying to put a square peg in a round
