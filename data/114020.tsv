2007-11-27T01:27:00.000Z	Andycass1		How to I make my apache server public, right now I can access it only via LAN ip, i cant access it even with" localhost"
2007-11-27T01:28:00.000Z	Andycass1		Ive forwarded the ports and have the dns set up, it was working fine with 8008 port, but when i put it back at 80, it just didnt want to work anymore
2007-11-27T01:28:00.000Z	DShepherd	Andycass1	maybe something else is running on port 80?
2007-11-27T01:29:00.000Z	Andycass1	DShepherd	No, i dont think so....
