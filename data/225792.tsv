2011-05-03T18:52:00.000Z	rob_p	Jessica175	I've had great success with vmware server on some of the older Ubuntu LTS's.
2011-05-03T18:52:00.000Z	rob_p	Jessica175	I also run vmware fusion on my Macs and it's a dream!
2011-05-03T18:53:00.000Z	rob_p	Jessica175	So my opinion is that vmware is quite good!
