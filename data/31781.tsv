2012-10-04T01:27:00.000Z	FireStorms		Hi I've got a question about ubuntu apacghe web server
2012-10-04T01:29:00.000Z	FireStorms		I'm wondering if it would be very difficult for a person with no experience with running an ubuntu apache web server except on localhost. I'm a PHP, MySQL, Javascript develop so I've got a lot on my plate already but my Web hosting company are unreliable so I'd prefer to run my own server. Is it very time consuming, require lots of maintenance?
