2005-11-18T17:38:00.000Z	Orborde	twisted_maple	AFAIK it's because MIDI is not set up by default on Ubuntu. Go searching the wiki/forums.
2005-11-18T17:38:00.000Z	twisted_maple	Orborde	-- got all the sound card set.  Timidity works find... trying to get the EMU-8000 to kick in.  Mods are all loaded.  Devices (sequencer) is created.
