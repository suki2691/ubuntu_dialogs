2006-04-26T14:55:00.000Z	JediMaster		hi all, I'm having a few problems with cups, I've added a network printer, and it says it's printing, but nothing comes out and the jobs never go, plus I'm getting errors in the cups logs about local authentication certificate not found
2006-04-26T07:53:00.000Z	JediMaster		hey all, I'm having some problems with dhcp, it appears to be ignoring the lease times, on boot it doesn't get an IP, I have to ifdown/up it, and it seems to get a new lease/ip every hour or two, even through it says it will be (roughly) 10 hours, and when it does, it breaks the smbmounts and causes havock =/
