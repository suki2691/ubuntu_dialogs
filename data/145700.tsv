2009-02-10T13:08:00.000Z	jla		I'm trying Ubuntu 8.10 on a Dell Inspiion 1200 (1.2Ghz 256MiB). I know it's not the recommended spec, but it's far from the low end. Everything is really slow. Accessing menus. programs starting (like yelp), synaptic searches. it all crawls. Where should I look to speed things up?
