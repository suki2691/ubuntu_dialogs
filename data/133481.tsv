2007-05-21T07:30:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Heptofite2	there's no 686 kernel anymore - there's a module gets autoloaded
2007-05-21T07:30:00.000Z	Heptofite2	Frogzoo	assuming an older version of the distro, what would the command be?
2007-05-21T07:31:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Heptofite2	sudo apt-get install linux-image-686
