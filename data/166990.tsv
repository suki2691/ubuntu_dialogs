2008-01-31T19:44:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	filthpig	you are even more incorrect if yyou had said gpl
2008-01-31T19:46:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	filthpig	if a codec were gpl'd, it would be free. but not all free formats are gpl'd
2008-01-31T19:48:00.000Z	filthpig	devilsadvocate	maybe not exactly, but some other, similar licence
