2005-04-08T12:32:00.000Z	robitaille	caffinated	 is there a big delay getting updates from a ca sources instead of the uk default one?
2005-04-08T12:32:00.000Z	caffinated	robitaille	i can't say, i don't live in the uk.
2005-04-08T12:33:00.000Z	robitaille	caffinated	 I guess I could try to swtich mine to the ca source; I never bothered until now; I guess it would be nicer for the nwtwork bandwith
