2011-09-18T02:47:00.000Z	BarkingFish		you'll probably have to move up to one of the later releases
2011-09-18T02:47:00.000Z	waiguoren	BarkingFish	what if I install the next release of network manger, say i have 9.03 and i install 9.04
2011-09-18T02:49:00.000Z	BarkingFish	waiguoren	you can try by all means, but I think you're looking at moving up to the next full release.  Others here may correct me on that, but I don't think you can upgrade component parts without upgrading what supports them.
