2006-07-10T09:48:00.000Z	OneSeventeen		I'm going to do a 15 minute review of Ubuntu in my next podcast, what key points should I cover?
2006-07-10T09:50:00.000Z	ardchoille	OneSeventeen	Yeah, I'd say ease of use. I have an 8 year old niece who uses Ubuntu exclusively on her computer and she loves it. If an 8 year old girl can use it..  :)
2006-07-10T09:55:00.000Z	OneSeventeen	ardchoille	my wife uses Ubuntu on my laptop too, and considering she doesn't even blink when switching between ubuntu and xp makes me think it is pretty user friendly as well
2006-07-10T09:57:00.000Z	ardchoille	OneSeventeen	Ubuntu is awesome. I have tried 17 distros in the last 5 years (been 100% Windows free) and Ubuntu has been.. well, just amazing.
