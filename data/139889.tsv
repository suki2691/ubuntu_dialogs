2007-05-03T06:16:00.000Z	kadakas		Is it a bug or a feature that when I copy or cut some text from a window and close that window - all the text copied is lost?
2007-05-03T06:17:00.000Z	soundray	kadakas	oh, I find that so annoying. Previously I used klipper in KDE and that made the CopyPaste-mess easier to deal with. I don't know if gnome has something like it.

2007-05-03T06:19:00.000Z	soundray	kadakas	I didn't know about that one. Installing it now...
