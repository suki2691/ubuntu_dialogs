2007-03-27T16:01:00.000Z	ctw		Hi! Since my last upgrade (I'm running Feisty) I cannot use my NVidia driver anymore. I get the following error message: Failed to load module "wfb" (module does not exist, 0)
2007-03-27T16:01:00.000Z	ctw		Is there anything I can do on my end to fix this, or do I have to wait for a fix in Ubuntu?
2007-03-27T16:02:00.000Z	Flannel	ctw	#ubuntu+1 for Feisty support, thanks
2007-03-27T16:02:00.000Z	ctw	Flannel	thanks!
