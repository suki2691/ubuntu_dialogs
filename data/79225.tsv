2010-09-20T05:23:00.000Z	KyleHughes		Can I bother someone for help with wget? :/
2010-09-20T05:23:00.000Z	Monotoko	KyleHughes	whats up?
2010-09-20T05:26:00.000Z	Monotoko	KyleHughes	for that you would need more than wget...you would need a full script and im not even sure if bash likes csv's
2010-09-20T05:27:00.000Z	Monotoko	KyleHughes	PHP is my speciality...could you not run a PHP script under localhost?
