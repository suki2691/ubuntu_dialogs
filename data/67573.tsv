2009-07-27T05:30:00.000Z	Firefishe	Drknezz	Had a compositing issue with kde4 (4.2.4 in my case) giving me an error saying compositing was too slow.  When it gets this testy, I just reboot in recovery mode, do a nice little fsck from the recovery mode ncurses screen, and boot from there.  Works nice that way at times ;)
