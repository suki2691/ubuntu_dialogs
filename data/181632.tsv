2006-06-17T12:37:00.000Z	j3g		anyone know when the next version of ubuntu is due?
2006-06-17T12:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	j3g	not until October, probably - the new version was only just released on June 1st
2006-06-17T12:39:00.000Z	j3g	Madpilot	it is said that the next version will support installing on dmraid (fake raid) disks... i don't want to try to install 6.06 as it doesn't have that support
2006-06-17T12:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	j3g	fair enough - what the next version will support is anyone's guess, though - development has barely begun
