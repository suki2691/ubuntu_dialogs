2006-03-15T17:23:00.000Z	CrazyOne		i have a fujifilm camera, and when I try to mount it to take images I am getting an error about etc/fstab
2006-03-15T17:24:00.000Z	CrazyOne		anybody know what the problem could be?  exact error "Warning: device /dev/sdf1 is already handled by /etc/fstab"
2006-03-15T17:24:00.000Z	me2win	CrazyOne	are you trying to mount something that has already been mounted?
2006-03-15T17:24:00.000Z	CrazyOne	me2win	I dont think so, all I did was connect my camera, switch it on and I get that
