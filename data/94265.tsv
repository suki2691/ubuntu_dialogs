2009-05-19T14:05:00.000Z	ShishKabab		Hello. When I'm SSHed into a remote machine, is there any way to easily copy files back to the local machine? Or is the scp command from the local machine the only option?

2009-05-19T14:09:00.000Z	ShishKabab	Flannel	It's just that if you're doing something on the remote machine via SSH, you'd have to logout or create another tab to copy a file, which isn't very handy...
