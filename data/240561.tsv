2007-06-02T12:37:00.000Z	blue|palm		Hi there, can anybody reccomend a good linux distro for C/C++ development of Linux applications? Ive heard that gentoo is supposedly good for that...
2007-06-02T12:37:00.000Z	blue|palm		lol i know what channel i am in... Im using ubuntu right now
2007-06-02T12:38:00.000Z	blue|palm		The problem is that ubuntu doesnt always have the latest stuff in the repos...
2007-06-02T12:38:00.000Z	qman	blue|palm	if you want bleeding edge, then gentoo will have it, but ubuntu is reasonably up to date
