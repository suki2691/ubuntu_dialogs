2012-07-30T07:18:00.000Z	EyesVAOnly		I have a question about drivers? Is that the right term? Or kernel modules? It has been a while since i did research into the basics of linux. Anywho, I have a wireless xbox 360 controller, and a hacked reciever from an xbox 360. I was wondering if anybody knew how to get it working in ubuntu off the top of their head
