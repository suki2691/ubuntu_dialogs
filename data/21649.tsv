2011-05-02T01:45:00.000Z	Inphernal		Hey all, trying to upgrade 10.10 64bit to 11.04, but I get "E:Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages." at "setting new software channels" step. No packages held
2011-05-02T01:46:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Inphernal	any 3rd party ppas and such?
2011-05-02T01:47:00.000Z	Inphernal	brontosaurusrex	Yeah, but they are disabled at the beginning of the upgrade? (Or so it says)
2011-05-02T01:47:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Inphernal	ok, i was just guessing
