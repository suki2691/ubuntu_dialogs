2006-04-01T15:52:00.000Z	Wolever		Would anyone know how to get the import command working on Ubuntu?  I'm trying to take a screenshot of the GDM login screen with very little success...\

2006-04-01T15:53:00.000Z	Wolever	mwe	Ya, I'm doing that now.... But I wanted to figure out why `import` wasen't there =\
2006-04-01T15:54:00.000Z	mwe	Wolever	because you need to install imagemagick I guess
