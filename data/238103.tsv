2007-12-22T06:48:00.000Z	ekim|dt-linux		I always wondered what the "sl"package did
2007-12-22T06:48:00.000Z	ekim|dt-linux		what is the difference between reiser ans ext3 ?
2007-12-22T06:48:00.000Z	stefano	ekim|dt-linux	both are linux file systems. if you're unsure what to use, choose ext3, it is more stable. raiserfs is a bit faster though
