2012-04-02T21:57:00.000Z	LinuxApprentice		was i supposed to install all updates for 10.10 before i upgraded to 11.04?
2012-04-02T21:59:00.000Z	auronandace	LinuxApprentice	that would be wise yes
2012-04-02T21:59:00.000Z	LinuxApprentice	auronandace	i didn't.....and it's already installing after clicking 'upgrade' so will it be a problem?
2012-04-02T22:00:00.000Z	auronandace	LinuxApprentice	i'm not sure, i usually fresh install (less to go wrong that way)
