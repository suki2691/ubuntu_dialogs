2010-04-06T14:36:00.000Z	Tom22		Hey. Does anyone know how to fix a segmentation fault? Kiba-dock fails to open due to a segmentation fault when not run in root... Any ideas?
2010-04-06T14:37:00.000Z	soreau	Tom22	kiba-dock is currently unmaintained
2010-04-06T14:38:00.000Z	Tom22	soreau	I've had this problem before, not with Kiba, with other apps, like Tilda and Yakuake...
2010-04-06T14:38:00.000Z	Tom22	soreau	must be an ubuntu problem :(
