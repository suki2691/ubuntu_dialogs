2006-06-13T08:22:00.000Z	Fjodor	Astinus-	I think it is hit or miss on a machine to machine basis. Works fine on my laptop
2006-06-13T08:22:00.000Z	Astinus-	Fjodor	i see no progress or resume information when hibernating or restoring from it
2006-06-13T08:23:00.000Z	Fjodor	Astinus-	Haven't got much experience other than for my laptop, it works :-/
