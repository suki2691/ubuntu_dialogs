2008-04-23T02:32:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	djzn	becuase in the old days, the boot partition needed to be first...
2008-04-23T02:32:00.000Z	djzn	Odd-rationale	that means, it is no no longer required... just like the "rule of thumb" which says swap should be 2*RAM
2008-04-23T02:33:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	djzn	the second is still a good rule if you plan to suspend to disk...
