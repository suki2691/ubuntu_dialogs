2007-05-15T10:51:00.000Z	albert		hi, i got a problem concerning the permissions to my mp3-player. i mounted it in ~/mp3 and ran xfe as root. changing permissions to this folder doesn't change them
2007-05-15T10:52:00.000Z	shatrat	albert	so are you talking about like a portable mp3 player?  maybe the filesystem on it doesnt support unix style permissions?
2007-05-15T10:53:00.000Z	albert	shatrat	i vfat, as far as xfe tells me
2007-05-15T10:53:00.000Z	albert	shatrat	as root i am able to copy data to it (it's a portable mp3-player). am i able to mount it with write-permissions to everybody?
