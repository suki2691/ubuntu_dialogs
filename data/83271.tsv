2008-08-09T14:47:00.000Z	rustychicken	Grobvok	i would just like to as: why do you need to know?
2008-08-09T14:47:00.000Z	Grobvok	rustychicken	Because I have partially downloaded a big package and I want to remove it.
2008-08-09T14:49:00.000Z	rustychicken	Grobvok	My suggestion would be to use Synaptic (System > Administration > Synaptic Package manager), i think it will clear out any of those things automatically
