2010-10-06T09:47:00.000Z	prince_jammys	SporkWitch	if you started X "by hand" from the console (without a gui login), i think it wouldn't run as root.
2010-10-06T09:47:00.000Z	SporkWitch	prince_jammys	that's correct
2010-10-06T09:49:00.000Z	prince_jammys	SporkWitch	mm, no the X server still runs as root with 'startx'
