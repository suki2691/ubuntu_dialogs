2011-09-23T18:21:00.000Z	laos		morning everyone - anyone here know why ubuntu server's apache2 server is having a hard time after having an internal ip change? (from 192.168.1.7 to 192.168.1.10)
2011-09-23T18:22:00.000Z	laos		dynamic dns isn't working anymore as a result
2011-09-23T18:23:00.000Z	mk1342	laos	might want to try #ubuntu-server
2011-09-23T18:23:00.000Z	laos	mk1342	thanks
