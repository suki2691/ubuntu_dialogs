2012-05-29T06:19:00.000Z	MrMalak		I have a little bit of an issue, I have tried to install Slackware and Fedora off of CD and both times my laptop wouldn't recognize them as bootable CD's even though my desktop would. I am trying an ubuntu CD next, but if it wont recognize it does any one have advice on what to do? I managed to get a slackware 13 cd to be recognized and installed but I would like somthing that has Gnome for a desktop option.

2012-05-29T06:21:00.000Z	bazhang	MrMalak	the alternate cd is the text-based one, it works when the live sometimes fails
2012-05-29T13:35:00.000Z	bazhang	MrMalak	choose from the login window
