2009-03-28T01:49:00.000Z	rogle	Jeruvy	There is nothing in gparted that says anything is read only. Is there somewhere specific I look in gparted to find that?
2009-03-28T01:50:00.000Z	Jeruvy	rogle	no, just wondered what filesystem, did you chmod anything?
2009-03-28T01:50:00.000Z	Jeruvy	rogle	or mount it as read-only?
