2009-12-23T00:58:00.000Z	Hydrosis		Is there a way to set a window to Never On Top?  I know you can set a window to Always On Top, but I need the opposite.
2009-12-23T00:59:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Hydrosis	Untick Always On Top -- That's the opposite.
2009-12-23T00:59:00.000Z	Hydrosis	kinja-sheep	you dont understand.  That is not the opposite.  I one window to NEVER be on top.  What you propose does not do that.
