2008-10-07T23:23:00.000Z	etesla		Hey, guys. I'm running into a problem with my Ubuntu install (Hardy Heron 8.04, I believe) in which the GUI side works fine, but when I try to ctrl-alt-F1 out to console, it goes schizo - I get half a screen of garbled partial white characters on black, and they flicker. Ctrl-alt-F7 brings me back to the UI side just fine, but I'd really love to get the console side working properly. Any thoughts?

2008-10-07T23:24:00.000Z	etesla	talntid	I'm not certain - let me look. (This is on a Sylvania g Netbook - I replaced the gOS Escape Pod OS that was originally on it.)
