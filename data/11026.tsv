2011-08-07T01:40:00.000Z	peepsalot		how do i switch from nvidia drivers to nouveau?  i used the "additional drivers" GUI tool or whatever it's called to disable nvidia but now i just can't get into X, it seems to still be looking for nvidia drivers on boot

2011-08-07T01:47:00.000Z	peepsalot	bregma	thanks, got into X  again
