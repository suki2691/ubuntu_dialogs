2006-05-10T15:06:00.000Z	Cliffb53		I'm setting up Ubuntu for dual-screen and I already have it working. yet, there's something I'm finding awfully annoying that is the fact that when I open a new window for some application, it starts on the most difficult monitor to use (i'm on a laptop and the external monitor is at my left)
2006-05-10T15:07:00.000Z	Cliffb53		I was wondering if it is possible to setup a main screen so that applications always start in the main screen
