2006-05-27T05:31:00.000Z	lobstu	rencrash	: type 'which samba'
2006-05-27T05:32:00.000Z	rencrash	lobstu	samba is installed as default on a ubuntu installation how do you find it to use it then?
2006-05-27T05:33:00.000Z	lobstu	rencrash	i know that one executes '/etc/init.d/samba restart' to restart the service, and that the config files are in /etc/samba/
