2010-08-23T07:33:00.000Z	twobitsprite		I tried going to the rdesktop website to find documentation, but it just says the documentation comes with it... but being as I'm stuck on my windows system, I can't get to the docs on my linux box
2010-08-23T07:35:00.000Z	twobitsprite		actually... ctrl-alt-enter leaves the fullscreen mode
2010-08-23T07:36:00.000Z	zzzed	twobitsprite	 how about ctrl+alt+F2, login, then sudo kill <pid>
