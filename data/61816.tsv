2009-08-01T17:09:00.000Z	hmw		I was trying to get the file name TO the clipboard by hitting F2 (rename file) and copying the file name to the c.b., but I accidentially pasted something instead ("/media/myssd/somefolder") and I hit enter, now the file is gone. ("renamed from /media/myssd/somefolder/xy.exe to /media/myssd/somefolder") - [sorry for spamming, just wanted to post one clear question and windows pidgin acts strangely]
2009-08-01T17:10:00.000Z	grawity	hmw	it is not possible to rename a file to a directory if it exists.
2009-08-01T17:10:00.000Z	hmw	grawity	well, it disappeared
2009-08-01T17:16:00.000Z	hmw	grawity	strange, i tried to reproduce and got an error message. After updatedb i tried to find the file, but it seems to be gone. What could I possibly have done??
