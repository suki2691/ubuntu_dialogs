2011-08-03T17:08:00.000Z	bhearsum		is it possible to have my network connections maintained by something other than the Network Manager *GUI*. ideally, i'd like to continue using nm-applet as a frontend, but have my connections not die when it dies, or when X shuts down, or i log out...
2011-08-03T17:09:00.000Z	bhearsum		boo :(
2011-08-03T17:09:00.000Z	bhearsum		any idea if there is plans to change this?
2011-08-03T17:09:00.000Z	phnord	bhearsum	just remove networkmanager and use /etc/network/interfaces
