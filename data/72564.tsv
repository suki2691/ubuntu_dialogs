2008-12-24T02:33:00.000Z	punzada		quick question, when using sed if i would pipe it through a command to eliminate a phrase like normal i know the syntax is s/expression/replacement, but i'm having trouble when the expression is a directory name and i have to replace the entire name say /tux/ in the file, I basically need to remove one or the other of the / to make the directory in the line stay intact
2008-12-24T02:33:00.000Z	punzada		anyone know the correct syntax for that?
2008-12-24T02:34:00.000Z	punzada		i tried using \ before one of the / but it didn't work any :(
