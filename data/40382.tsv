2011-01-14T21:12:00.000Z	dnivra		I am running Ubuntu 10.10. When I boot my computer, gdm does not start. I am able to login using tty1, start/stop/restart gdm but no gui is shown when I switch to tty7. what could possibly be wrong? running startx from tty1 doesn't prove successful either. i also tried booting to recovery mode and run "fail safe" mode but nothing happens. it just says "standby one minute while the display restarts" but does nothing.

2011-01-14T21:14:00.000Z	dnivra	Pici	was that for me? add -exec mv?
2011-01-14T21:14:00.000Z	Pici	dnivra	No, sorry. Mistab.
