2007-05-20T06:40:00.000Z	Newbish	Paddy_EIRE	Are you on KDE or GNOME?
2007-05-20T06:40:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Newbish	gnome, but its not the network manager applet that needs configing yet
2007-05-20T06:41:00.000Z	Newbish	Paddy_EIRE	In the terminal type ifconfig x.x.x.x where x.x.x.x = your prospective IP address.
