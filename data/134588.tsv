2007-05-16T06:41:00.000Z	tikka	Lacrymology	using a jabber client and connecting to google talk network
2007-05-16T06:52:00.000Z	Lacrymology	tikka	thanks, that was stupid.. but what server should I use? gmail.com, I guess since it goes like user@server but gaim stays put at "connecting" and I don't see my contacts..
2007-05-16T06:53:00.000Z	tikka	Lacrymology	i honestly don't know but gtalk site does have some details on the settings you would require. I have no idea if they are gaim specific. I am sorry I couldnt be more help.
