2005-09-16T05:46:00.000Z	BirdyKiller		I wanted to ask if anyone can explain or link me to an explanation of how to disable my laptop's touchpad?  I already have a USB mouse connected, and hate this damned touchpad
2005-09-16T05:47:00.000Z	f00li5h	BirdyKiller	perhaps you can disable it in bios?
2005-09-16T05:48:00.000Z	BirdyKiller	f00li5h	I'd have to check again to be sure, but if I remember right I tried that a while ago and no such luck...
