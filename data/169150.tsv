2006-09-01T10:16:00.000Z	ocelot_		 I have installed ndiswrapper with the right drivers for my card, typed modprobe ndiswrapper and it still does not work---what could be possibly wrong?????
2006-09-01T10:17:00.000Z	kitche	ocelot_	does ndiswrapper say driver present hardware present
2006-09-01T10:17:00.000Z	ocelot_	kitche	yes it does when I type ndiswrapper -l, that's why I don't understand why its not working
2006-09-01T10:19:00.000Z	kitche	ocelot_	well it won't say anything
