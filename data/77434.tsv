2008-10-11T03:21:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	damiji1	"failed" - I'd recommend solving that issue, since that points to some system issues, before installing a non-standard package and possibly interfering with system packages
2008-10-11T03:23:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	damiji1	also, have you considered Eclipse as a possible alternative to netbeans?
2008-10-11T03:25:00.000Z	damiji1	IntuitiveNipple	I have, and I use it on Windows, but right now I'm trying to learn OpenOffice extensions, and it integrates with NetBeans
