2007-10-28T21:37:00.000Z	CodenameKT	tone	whoah you talking about overclocking cause that different channel
2007-10-28T21:38:00.000Z	tone	CodenameKT	no not overclock, i have a 1.86ghz proc that is running at 1ghz but throttles to 1.86ghz under pressure. I want it to always run at 1.86ghz like it was intended to; not overclocking.
2007-10-28T21:39:00.000Z	CodenameKT	tone	sorry i don't know what could cause that but it sounds like it isn't somehting that should be messed with if it is running like that seems fine
