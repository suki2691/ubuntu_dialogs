2007-01-29T10:06:00.000Z	Jimboob		Im planing to switch from windows to linux but i really use this puter for multimedia development, ie. music, videos, and burning cd's/dvd's will this be a problem with ubuntu?

2007-01-29T10:11:00.000Z	whaq	Jimboob	those are considered to be 'basic' multimedia functions.. should be no problem.
