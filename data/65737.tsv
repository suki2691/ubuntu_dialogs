2009-11-27T20:02:00.000Z	EpicDyo		I have a problem with downloading packages. I'm running Ubuntu Release 9.10. Kernel Linux 2.6.31-14-generic and GNOME 2.28.1. Whenever I try and download a package, it says it's broken.

2009-11-27T20:04:00.000Z	noren	EpicDyo	open console >> sudo apt-get update >> do this
