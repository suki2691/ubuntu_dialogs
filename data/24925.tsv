2010-10-04T22:34:00.000Z	popcalent		does somebody know if it's possible to clone a 32GB HD into a 16GB pendrive with DD? I'm only using about 5GB in the 32GB HD. I would like to have a bootable pendrive with exactly the same I have in my HD. But I need to know if it's possible to clone 32GB>16GB before buying the pendrive. Thanks!

2010-10-04T22:36:00.000Z	popcalent	susanowo	but can I do this into a 16GB pendrive?
