2009-05-04T18:39:00.000Z	histo	sriramoman	isnt' the ffmpeg in ubuntu crippled or did they resolve that?
2009-05-04T18:39:00.000Z	sriramoman	histo	oh is it coz it is crippled eh? in hardy it worked perfectly so i thought it'd work
2009-05-04T18:40:00.000Z	histo	sriramoman	hrm... shouldn't be much different from hardy's version. You can see if medibuntu has a ffmpeg that will be uncrippled definately
