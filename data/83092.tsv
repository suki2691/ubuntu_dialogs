2008-08-10T05:17:00.000Z	lordfdisk		May I ask what is the best way to add myself to the vboxusers groups. in Ubuntu 8.04?
2008-08-10T05:17:00.000Z	zcat[1]	lordfdisk	sudo nano /etc/groups  and I can't remember if you put your name after the vboxuser group or vboxusers after your name.. one of those
2008-08-10T05:36:00.000Z	lordfdisk	zcat[1]	when I did sudo nano /etc/groups  there no list I'm I doing something wrong?
2008-08-10T05:36:00.000Z	zcat[1]	lordfdisk	yes. /etc/group -- no 's'
