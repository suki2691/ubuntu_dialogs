2009-04-16T13:16:00.000Z	jetftwi		Ubuntu guys I am a computer engineering undergraduate and I am now currently 50% 50% about studying either linux   or windows  in detail I opt linux for I think of nothing but looking for advice from you what do you think I am doing ,
2009-04-16T13:17:00.000Z	jscinoz_	jetftwi	linux, no question, its much more flexible, and linux sysadmins are more useful than windows sysadmins
2009-04-16T13:17:00.000Z	jscinoz_	jetftwi	yeah ext2ifs hasnt been updated in a long time, a while ago the default inode size was set to 256
2009-04-16T13:18:00.000Z	jscinoz_	jetftwi	so basically unless you recreate the  ext3 partition with a smaller inode size (destroying all data), you wont be able to read it with that ext2ifs driver for windows
