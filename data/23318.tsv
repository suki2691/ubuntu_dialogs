2010-11-01T22:34:00.000Z	sdk		Quick question.. Trying to connect from my desktop to a remote server (both running 10.10) with vncviewer.  I'm trying to log in with a username that is different from the logged in local user.  The command vncviewer -user USERID IPADDRESS:1 fails with no message, just the 'short help'.  Does anyone have any ideas? I can log in as the local user via vnc with no problem.
