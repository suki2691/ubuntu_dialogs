2007-07-24T08:20:00.000Z	Vlet	wbadger	There are no swap files in linux - they are swap partitions
2007-07-24T08:21:00.000Z	wbadger	Vlet	vim tells me it found a swap file (I was probably editing when the computer crashed)
2007-07-24T08:22:00.000Z	wbadger	Vlet	it says: "[you should recover the file with :recover]  [..]  If you did this already, delete the swap file ".family_locate.c.swp"
