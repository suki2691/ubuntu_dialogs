2006-12-09T09:01:00.000Z	mrMister		Hey, guys. I just installed Ubuntu following the FakeRaidHowto. Ubuntu is behaving a bit strangely. I can't log in through gdm most of the time. I just get a clear screen. just the backgroundimage and nothing more.
2006-12-09T09:02:00.000Z	mrMister		have any of you had this problem?
