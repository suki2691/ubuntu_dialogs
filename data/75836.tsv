2010-10-16T12:46:00.000Z	hardwired	airtonix	good idea, I never thought about SSH
2010-10-16T12:48:00.000Z	airtonix	hardwired	just remember though that if you run an application that is normally launched with parameters to give you sane defaults (like nautilus) then you will need to provide those parameters...(ie without --no-desktop nautilus will render a desktop plane for itself)
