2005-11-20T11:39:00.000Z	lingoist		is it really so difficult?
2005-11-20T11:39:00.000Z	NoUse	lingoist	does your monitor support that resolution?
2005-11-20T11:46:00.000Z	NoUse	lingoist	try running 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' from a terminal and see if you can enable that resolution from there
