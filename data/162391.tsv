2006-10-26T13:09:00.000Z	GhostFreeman		What's the command to upgrade to Edgy?
2006-10-26T13:09:00.000Z	GhostFreeman		I got it, thanks
2006-10-26T13:11:00.000Z	GhostFreeman		Will I need to reinstall ATI flgrx drivers when this finishes?
2006-10-26T13:12:00.000Z	exclude	GhostFreeman	I am not sure, but I am in here because my ATI did not work any longer after the upgrade :)
