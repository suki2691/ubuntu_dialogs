2012-10-04T01:22:00.000Z	Nick__		When I try to install Ubuntu 64 bit Desktop, I get the the first menu okay, but using any of the options just brings up a screen with lines.  I tried it on two different PC's.  Can anyone help me out?

2012-10-04T01:25:00.000Z	Nick__	TJ-	I didn't but I burned the image twice.  Attempting to use the check media button in the installer also brings up the same lines.
