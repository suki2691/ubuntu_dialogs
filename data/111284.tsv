2010-06-01T09:12:00.000Z	JC		A common misconception is that 64-bit architectures are no better than 32-bit architectures unless the computer has more than 4 GB of main memory. This is not entirely true:
2010-06-01T09:12:00.000Z	JC		System architecture on Intel x86/32-bit architecture limits virtual memory space to 3 GB, not 4 GB, due to much of the 3â€“4 GB region being reserved for hardware addressing; see 3 GB barrier. This is not present in 64-bit architectures, which can use 4 GB of memory and more. However x86 processors from the Pentium II onwards allow for a 36-bit physical memory address space, using Physical Address Extension, which gives a 64 GB physical address r
