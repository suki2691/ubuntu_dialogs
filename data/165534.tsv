2006-11-04T06:32:00.000Z	his_dudnes	cobelloy	: try mencoder
2006-11-04T06:33:00.000Z	his_dudnes	cobelloy	: i dont know if it does this particular conversion but it does most of the multimedia conversions possible
2006-11-04T06:34:00.000Z	his_dudnes	cobelloy	batch and gui are not ment to be together in my opinion...
