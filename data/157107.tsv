2007-11-02T18:12:00.000Z	ideasman42_		is it possible to make ubuntu a server for ical on the mac?
2007-11-02T18:13:00.000Z	ideasman42_		evolution-data-server says it supports icalendar but I cant see how to set it up
2007-11-02T18:15:00.000Z	MasterShrek	ideasman42_	probably not since ical is (im assuming) a mac program
