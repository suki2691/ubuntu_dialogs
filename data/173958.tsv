2006-07-23T13:06:00.000Z	euly		still looking for info on how to set the screen resolution to 1280x1024.
2006-07-23T13:06:00.000Z	PacketScan	euly	xorg.conf?
2006-07-23T13:07:00.000Z	euly		One question before I continue with the resolution thingy: how do I disable these "so and so has joined #ubuntu" lines in irssi?
2006-07-23T13:08:00.000Z	euly	PacketScan	BioVorE: Yes, I already put "1280" in the modes lines, but that didnt help :(
