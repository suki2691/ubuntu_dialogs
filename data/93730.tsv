2008-05-01T00:02:00.000Z	AzizLight	nibsa1242b	hoe can I verify what is the max temperature the hd/cpu should get?
2008-05-01T00:04:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	AzizLight	you need to know the exact processor model # and look it up on the manufacturer's website -- most laptop hds are somewhere between 50-65C, and processors are somewhere between 75-95C if relatively modern equipment
