2010-02-06T08:34:00.000Z	Shazam		I just found a bunch of data I thought I lost, important to me. I realize that I'm running with effectively *no* backups of about 100 GB of critical data
2010-02-06T08:34:00.000Z	Shazam		what's an effective backup mechanism?
2010-02-06T08:35:00.000Z	koshari	Shazam	i like to use rsync
2010-02-06T08:36:00.000Z	Shazam	koshari	reading previous comment, and looking into rsync as well.
