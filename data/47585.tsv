2011-10-10T10:12:00.000Z	ptl		no word about showmount nfs4 problem? I've read that showmount does not work with nfs4, but I've found no alternative
2011-10-10T10:13:00.000Z	theadmin	ptl	Does the ordinary "mount" command or "cat /etc/mtab" show it?
2011-10-10T10:14:00.000Z	ptl	theadmin	no, showmount is supposed to list the clients from the NFS server
2011-10-10T10:14:00.000Z	ptl	theadmin	I want to know, from the server, which clients are mounting its filesystems
