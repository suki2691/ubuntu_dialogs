2011-07-09T13:24:00.000Z	_W_		if I haven't updated my remote server from Jaunty, is there now any hope of updating it, without a reinstall?
2011-07-09T13:24:00.000Z	Barnabas	_W_	apt-get dist upgrade
2011-07-09T13:33:00.000Z	Barnabas	_W_	how about downloading the relevant isos to the server, and mounting the iso for an update from that media
2011-07-09T13:33:00.000Z	_W_	Barnabas	yeah I guess that could work
