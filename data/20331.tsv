2011-11-04T18:22:00.000Z	Muphrid	_Rod2k	you can choose during the login screen (lightdm) clicking in the engine next to the name

2011-11-04T18:25:00.000Z	Muphrid	_Rod2k	no, they coexist peacefully, just choose between them during the login screen, in the worst case it will break only if you remove the unity package
