2007-06-19T09:14:00.000Z	kravlin		hey. my friend switched over to ubuntu but he's having problems with his graphics card. its anvidia FX 5500 and whenever he loads the drivers it always screws up xwindows to the point of no return. Any ideas?
2007-06-19T09:15:00.000Z	notgod	kravlin	can you be more clear about what "screws up xwindows" means?
2007-06-19T09:15:00.000Z	notgod	kravlin	are you using the binary driver?
2007-06-19T09:16:00.000Z	notgod	kravlin	System->administration->restricted drivers manager ?
