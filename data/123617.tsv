2008-09-17T14:29:00.000Z	airtonix	Ziroday	envy is about dirvers yeah? so if he just ran the driver installer then surely to get the Xserver to use  it a restart of the Xserver is order
2008-09-17T14:30:00.000Z	Ziroday	airtonix	yes however the effects dialoge in appearance iirc checks to see if the drivers are installed. Since envy installs them manually they appear uninstalled
