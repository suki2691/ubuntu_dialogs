2007-01-22T15:28:00.000Z	Draconicus		Hey, I'm trying to create a fat16 partition with the text-based parition editor (in the alternate install) nd it's failing every time. I'm not even trying to mount it as anything. Can anyone help?
2007-01-22T15:29:00.000Z	Draconicus		Kind of an experiment.

2007-01-22T15:31:00.000Z	Draconicus	HymnToLife	Well, even so, it's a good, reliable partitioner.
