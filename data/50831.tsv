2009-08-09T00:39:00.000Z	tbi		Sup guys? Does anybody here know how to go about changing the 'distribution name'? As in what is listed in the System Monitor? Is there a config file somewhere that I should know about because Google has found me no answers.
2009-08-09T00:39:00.000Z	jm2	tbi	look at /etc/motd
2009-08-09T00:42:00.000Z	jm2	tbi	 are you trying to change the name using telnet or ftp?
2009-08-09T00:44:00.000Z	jm2	tbi	sorry. no clue. I was thinking it was login message.
