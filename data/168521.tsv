2006-09-03T10:51:00.000Z	Clawfinger		Hey, I managed to get my Linux working properly, configured router, everything is good so far. But I'm a complete Linux newbie and I'm trying to install AMSN.. I'm in the root terminal with the apt-get install.. but it's saying package can't be found. Every time.
2006-09-03T10:51:00.000Z	sethk	Clawfinger	sudo apt-get update

2006-09-03T10:52:00.000Z	Clawfinger	sethk	I don't think I have synaptic..
