2009-01-04T17:11:00.000Z	J-_		After a break from the server(ubuntu 8.04), I turned it back on and I found that sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart doesn't work. So, I cd /etc/init.d/ and networking isn't there. Is there a way to reconfigure the system to bring it back? My server still works both locally(with internal IP), and people say my website is working. Though, I can't access it through my LAN with either WAN IP, or domain name.

2009-01-04T17:15:00.000Z	b00ley	J-_	you delete that?
