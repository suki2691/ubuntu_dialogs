2011-07-14T13:26:00.000Z	unop	buggyer	you can use a loop device on pretty much any of the standard filesystems..  I'd think this might do.     mount -o loop -t ext3 your_ext3_file /path/to/directory
2011-07-14T13:27:00.000Z	buggyer	unop	is it possible to give the loopback device a specific size? if i crate a 500GB big file, would the loopback device then also have 500gb of size?
