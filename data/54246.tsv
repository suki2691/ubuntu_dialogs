2009-06-26T02:06:00.000Z	Flannel	wheatthin	What does it say?
2009-06-26T02:10:00.000Z	Flannel	wheatthin	Yes.  Can you please pastebin the output of this command: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2009-06-26T02:11:00.000Z	wheatthin	Flannel	as I said, pastebin claims it's a spam, it wont' allow me to use it
