2009-08-13T14:17:00.000Z	chrisfs		Hi, I'm a newbie,. I just started Ubuntu last week coming from Windows. I'm trying to install Adobe Flash plugin. I went to Applications and clicked on Add and it seems the Flash plugin installer is already installed, but I can't seem to find an icon for it, so that I can run the installer. I figure it's something basic I don't know about  Can someone help tell me what that is ?
