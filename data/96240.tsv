2008-03-29T14:29:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	Yazan-	depends of your router. Try gateway ip: http://...
2008-03-29T14:30:00.000Z	Yazan-	mmm4m5m	I've tried all the IP's I've got from ipconfig and they all don't work. I think I am going to call the DSL-provider and ask them
2008-03-29T14:32:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	Yazan-	better read router docs. What is your router? Usual IP could be is 192.168.1.2 (192.168.1.?), usual router IP have to be 192.168.1.1
