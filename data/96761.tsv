2008-08-10T12:42:00.000Z	DistroJockey	DeFirence	how much RAM have you got and do you need suspend/hibernate?
2008-08-10T12:42:00.000Z	DeFirence	DistroJockey	i probably wont use hibernate, maybe suspend?
2008-08-10T12:43:00.000Z	DistroJockey	DeFirence	swap needs to be same size as RAM or a little bigger for hibernate/suspend
