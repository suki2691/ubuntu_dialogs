2011-08-14T04:15:00.000Z	luigi	C_Smith	Probably some implementation of x264 for video, and faac for audio.
2011-08-14T04:16:00.000Z	luigi	C_Smith	ubuntu-restricted-extras usually does the trick.
2011-08-14T04:17:00.000Z	luigi	C_Smith	Look for ffmpeg as well. That might be used for the video blitter. I'm not good with banshee with video, so I can't help much past that.
