2005-06-20T10:49:00.000Z	madsen		Why the hell does Xorg.0.log tell me that COMPOSITE is loaded, when xcompmgr tells me it's not?!?
2005-06-20T10:50:00.000Z	seth_k	madsen	maybe it tries to load and fails?
2005-06-20T10:50:00.000Z	madsen	seth_k	It doesn't show anything about failing in the log.
2005-06-20T10:51:00.000Z	madsen	seth_k	Only error I get is about PreInit failing for "Synaptics Touchpad" which I don't even have...
