2010-01-06T00:05:00.000Z	acicula	Misantropo	change the mirror in software-sources so it points to whereever your local mirror resides?
2010-01-06T00:06:00.000Z	Misantropo	acicula	i'll try that
2010-01-06T00:08:00.000Z	Misantropo	acicula	i've just tried what you said and my mirror is not found on the list, also there is no option to add a custom mirror
