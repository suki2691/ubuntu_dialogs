2007-09-22T15:00:00.000Z	ShiftyPowers		hey all, quick question...i want to upgrade my HTPC from edgy to feisty
2007-09-22T15:01:00.000Z	ShiftyPowers		is the best way to do it via update-manager?
2007-09-22T15:01:00.000Z	ShiftyPowers		i don't want to fresh install because i have a lot of things already set up
2007-09-22T15:01:00.000Z	macd	ShiftyPowers	yes that is the best way.
