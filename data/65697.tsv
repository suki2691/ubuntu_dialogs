2009-05-13T12:18:00.000Z	Vesayth	losher	I upgraded my firmware so that I could put a stop to the maximum bandwidth usage my roommates use for limewire
2009-05-13T12:18:00.000Z	Vesayth	losher	Unfortunately, the linksys firmware does not allow me to do that without blocking it alltogether
2009-05-13T12:20:00.000Z	losher	vesayth	sorry, but it doesn't sound like a Ubuntu problem. Try a different version of the firmware? Yours sounds broken. Port forwarding should just work, it's pretty damn basic
2009-05-13T12:20:00.000Z	Vesayth	losher	I'll try that. Do you know of any rooms that I can join for specific help with this stuff?
