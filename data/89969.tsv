2009-02-03T15:22:00.000Z	Akiv1		How can I make a website address like such: 425.245.245.245/~user/ act like a top level domain, meaning rewrite it so that doing a $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] includes /~user?
2009-02-03T15:23:00.000Z	Akiv1		This is new ground for me, but there must be a way... Reason I ask is that I have to setup a test server right now and before I point the name servers over, I need to thoroughly test... But the code is not at all portable and I want to fix some of the global variables they use

2009-02-03T15:24:00.000Z	Akiv1	ActionParsnip	I couldn't agree more, but right now thatis not the point
