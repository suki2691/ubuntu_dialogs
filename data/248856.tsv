2005-06-02T09:37:00.000Z	Tsingi		Looking for a new distro to put on my laptop for development.  I have been using fc2 and am familiar with (not lately) slackware and mandrake, all of which I have also installed on laptops.
2005-06-02T09:37:00.000Z	Tsingi		looking for some feedback on ubunto for a possibility
