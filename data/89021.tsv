2008-06-05T13:59:00.000Z	^root1		could someone tell me what does: tar cvzf /home/user2/backup.tar.gz /home/user2/test &> /dev/null do?
2008-06-05T14:00:00.000Z	neil_d	^root1	creates an archive of /home/user2/test
2008-06-05T14:01:00.000Z	^root1	neil_d	and that's all? does it delete the dir that it made backup of?
2008-06-05T14:02:00.000Z	neil_d	^root1	I don't think tar can delete files. so no
