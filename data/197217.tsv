2010-04-10T16:36:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Fudge	depends on how big the memory is available on the one that hard locked
2010-04-10T16:39:00.000Z	Fudge	psycho_oreos	 this machine is quadcore intel with 4gig cosair but when ever i try moving 6, 9, 12 gig files etc to the other sata drive after a bit it just freezes
2010-04-10T16:40:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Fudge	generally no but I could be wrong, setup swap file and see
