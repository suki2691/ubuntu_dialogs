2006-01-09T12:01:00.000Z	IRON_FART		Does anyone have any clue why Ubuntu would artifact and crash after boot? Happened on 5.04 and 5.10
2006-01-09T12:03:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	IRON_FART	yes... you have hardware issues... i would bank on it esp. if you use the default install
2006-01-09T12:07:00.000Z	IRON_FART	nomasteryoda	What do you mean 'bank' on it?
2006-01-09T12:07:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	IRON_FART	 2 separate versions of Ubuntu and you still have crashed it on install
