2011-06-08T13:56:00.000Z	c-c-m		hello, I have installed ubuntu 11.04 into a HP dv500 and it doesn't detect the wifi card, even though I activated the restricted drivers that ubuntu detected
2011-06-08T13:56:00.000Z	c-c-m		is there any way to solve this problem?
2011-06-08T13:56:00.000Z	c-c-m		the laptop is a little bit old right now
2011-06-08T13:56:00.000Z	cordiceps	c-c-m	try a different distro.
