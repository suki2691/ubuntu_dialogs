2007-05-30T08:20:00.000Z	nikosapi		Hello, I deleted the root user account and I would like to add it back. I've booted off a live cd and am about to do it. Any pointers, recommendations?

2007-05-30T08:31:00.000Z	nikosapi	MISTERTibbs	I just fixed it, and yes you can delete the root account and it will still work perfectly fine except you can't do any admin stuff.
