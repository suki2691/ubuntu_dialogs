I still want to install Ubuntu but I continually get an error after the partition selection that the swap partition fales to mount. I've tried 2 different drives and both using my own partition setup and a full disk setup and still
2011-09-18T09:20:00.000Z	rocknblogger		 nothing. Any suggestions?
2011-09-18T09:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rocknblogger	What is the exact error message Ubuntu gives you and when (during install, first boot after install...)?
2011-09-18T09:23:00.000Z	rocknblogger	Jordan_U	The attempt to mount a file system with type swap in SCSI (0,1,0) partition#5 (sda) at none failed.
