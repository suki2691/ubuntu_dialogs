2011-05-12T00:29:00.000Z	Dobuntu		I have created a virtual host on a remote server as well as the dir for the logs a www docs.  Now I  normally, on my local I would go to the, network settings -> hosts tab to configure dns routing.  What should I study to learn how to do this on a remote?  Search terms or a link would be greatly appreciated!  PS: I am new to managing a server...
