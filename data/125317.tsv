2010-07-13T12:35:00.000Z	pizzle		Hello, I'm on Ubuntu 10.04. I disconnected a USB sata connection from a 1.5 TB drive on my system and replaced it with a 160 Gb drive without unmounting the first drive. The 160 Gb drive now shows the geometry and label of the 1.5 TB drive and cannot be read. I have tried testdisk and have not been able to get the drive to work properly yet. Any help?

2010-07-13T12:40:00.000Z	pizzle	bullgard4	I neglected to use the umount and now have the wrong geometry and label on one of the drives. I'm trying to see if I can get that fixed or if I've just lost my data
