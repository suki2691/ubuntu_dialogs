2008-02-07T05:39:00.000Z	h-town		i've done a dual boot with vista and ubuntu before, but I was wondering if there is a way to configure my partition so that ubuntu has like 75% of my drive and vista has 25% or even less?
2008-02-07T05:40:00.000Z	h-town		i've done that and I had massive problems, ubuntu won't recognize the old vista partition, even though i've used gparted to format it properly
2008-02-07T05:41:00.000Z	h-town		would my best bet be to install ubuntu, and then vista?
2008-02-07T05:41:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubunti	h-town	vista then ubuntu
