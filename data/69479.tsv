2009-01-07T00:16:00.000Z	lorenzosu	vigo	No. What's that?
2009-01-07T00:18:00.000Z	vigo	lorenzosu	I seem to remember it is in the Edit or Tools, then there is an Advanced section, then there is Keyboard shortcuts, I just re-installed this Ubuntu so have not set up T-Bird yet, but I do have Sea Monkey
2009-01-07T00:19:00.000Z	lorenzosu	vigo	Can't find that entry :/
