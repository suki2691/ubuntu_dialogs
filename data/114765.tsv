2007-11-02T20:48:00.000Z	mkz		ok, I've just had my system hang for the third time in as many days.  I need to know what log files I can look at to help me figure out why this is happening.  I'm running on a freshly installed copy of kubuntu gutsy.  Any suggestions?
2007-11-02T20:50:00.000Z	achadwick	mkz	including Magic SysRq keys (google) and Ctrl+Alt+F1 ?
2007-11-02T20:52:00.000Z	mkz	achadwick	yes to ctrl-alt-f1.  I don't think I have a sysrq key defined.  I'm using an older Type M (101) keyboard which does have a SysRq key, but I never defined it.
2007-11-02T20:53:00.000Z	mkz	achadwick	I see that the sysrq key is actually a key combo.  let me print the page for future reference
