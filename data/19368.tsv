2011-09-09T22:14:00.000Z	thunsucker	ThinkT510	good thinking, i think typing "sudo vi" is hard programmed into me now lol
2011-09-09T22:14:00.000Z	ThinkT510	thunsucker	no worries, i'm not that advanced myself (nano suit me best)
2011-09-09T22:15:00.000Z	thunsucker	ThinkT510	vi makes me angry at times but it's an old friend now don't think I'll ever be able to change
