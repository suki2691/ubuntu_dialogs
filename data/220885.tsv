2005-09-11T14:01:00.000Z	drrakn	GioSico	if you decide to go that route -- start with "man mdadm". It'll be a bit time consuming, but not too painful.

2005-09-11T14:10:00.000Z	GioSico		is mdadm the software raid utility?
2005-09-11T14:11:00.000Z	drrakn	GioSico	unison/rsync are userland mirroring sync utilities and they can work over a network (or locally)
