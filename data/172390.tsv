2006-08-04T08:46:00.000Z	LogicalDash		The entry for WinXP in my Grub menu seems to have been overwritten with the most recent Ubuntu update. How do I put it back?
2006-08-04T08:46:00.000Z	scrappy_	LogicalDash	there should still be a commented out example for xp
2006-08-04T08:48:00.000Z	scrappy_	LogicalDash	what is the partition? hda1 or hda2?
