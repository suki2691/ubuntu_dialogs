2009-02-10T08:26:00.000Z	tavius		anyone here know how I can set up my computer to route my other computer through it to the net... both are ubuntu, and I have them talking to each other... but the other one won't reach the net
2009-02-10T08:27:00.000Z	tavius		anyone familiar enough with networking and using a computer as a router to answer that?
