2008-01-07T06:56:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Eagle2160	put windows cd in cd-rom drive, reboot and reinstall?
2008-01-07T06:56:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Eagle2160	or if you installed ubuntu without overwriting windows, just go to a recovery console and type fixmbr
2008-01-07T07:06:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Eagle2160	I already explained to you both of your options for putting windows back on your machine, why do you keep asking?
