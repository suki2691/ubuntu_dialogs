2007-07-29T10:50:00.000Z	dirk_		Could someone help me? I have an partition /media/daten. Today I installed ubuntu new. I wanted to copy my music to this partition. No rights to write. SO I changed the right under root with chmod 777 /media/daten. Now I can write on this partiton. But now then I want to open a file for example in my home directory is it light grey int the background an I can't open it. If I use the shell, e.g. with apt-get install file. I get the message that the file is
