2012-02-14T03:39:00.000Z	jbbarnes		My ubuntu server is in bad shape. A rebuilt can't wait until 12.04 is released. Can I install the current 12.04 build and run an update once it is officially released?
2012-02-14T03:40:00.000Z	cfhowlett	jbbarnes	if you're comfortable with an alpha?
2012-02-14T03:41:00.000Z	jbbarnes	cfhowlett	I could install the alpha, but would I be able to upgrade it to the release version later, or am I stuck in alphaland forever?
2012-02-14T03:41:00.000Z	cfhowlett	jbbarnes	pretty sure the best practices path would be a clean install...
