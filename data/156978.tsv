2009-05-29T21:43:00.000Z	IHS_Intern		I got some olf P4s, and just processors... which is going to be a better idea to use, a 2.4ghz with 512kb l2 cache, or 2.8ghz with 128kb cache..the 2.4 is branded as a P4, the 2.8 as a celeron.
2009-05-29T21:44:00.000Z	thiebaude	IHS_Intern	i second that
2009-05-29T21:45:00.000Z	IHS_Intern	erUSUL	thanks, I was wondering if the .4ghz could make up for it.
2009-05-29T21:45:00.000Z	thiebaude	IHS_Intern	its not much difference
