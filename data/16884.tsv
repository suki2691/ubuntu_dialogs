2011-03-15T21:56:00.000Z	eviljames		Is there perhaps a Ubuntu advanced channel of sorts?
2011-03-15T21:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_TCL	eviljames	 not that ive ever noticed.
2011-03-15T21:57:00.000Z	eviljames	Dr_Willis_TCL	This is unfortunate.  Know anyone who knows anything about lvm/ubuntu combinations?
2011-03-15T21:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_TCL	eviljames	 nope. i dont use lvm, or raid. to many hassles.
