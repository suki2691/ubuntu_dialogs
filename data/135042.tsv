2007-08-03T09:15:00.000Z	kandrews		my friend is having a little trouble running a program in his home directory. It needs python to work and he has it in his path. Yet, the program keeps complaining there is no python. I'm running the program just fine with python2.5 so I don't think it is a python version issue. Anyone know anything I could try?

2007-08-03T09:17:00.000Z	kandrews	kitche	bruenig: he runs a bash script which then calls python.
