2011-12-25T01:11:00.000Z	philpem	trism	I figured that'd be one option
2011-12-25T01:12:00.000Z	philpem	trism	what I'd like to know is which commands the gutenprint dev team use to make the release tarballs from CVS
2011-12-25T01:12:00.000Z	philpem	trism	if I had a rel tarball it'd presumably have the docs prebuilt, thus making it far easier to package
