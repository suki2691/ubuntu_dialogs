2011-12-06T02:21:00.000Z	KettleCooked	xangua	thanks. I'm using Ubuntu on my 2nd monitor to the right and have the menu on the left is really problematic that way
2011-12-06T02:22:00.000Z	xangua	KettleCooked	ooh you mean to MOVE the launcher between monitorsÂ¿ i don't think you can do that....for now
2011-12-06T02:26:00.000Z	KettleCooked	xangua	no kinda what jespers link hinted at, I'm half into the first link you posted though
