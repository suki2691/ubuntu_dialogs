2011-04-22T17:30:00.000Z	bibic682		Hello, How do I tell if I am running a 32 or 64 bit version of 10.10
2011-04-22T17:31:00.000Z	davro	bibic682	uname -m
2011-04-22T17:33:00.000Z	davro		!ask
2011-04-22T17:33:00.000Z	bibic682	davro	Thanx   looks like 64....It must have installed that version by default since I have an Athlon 64 proc.
