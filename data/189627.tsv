2006-10-05T08:35:00.000Z	baxter_kylie	SpComb	Excellent. So at that point I'd only need to have the raid config file and use a mkraid, right?
2006-10-05T08:36:00.000Z	SpComb	baxter_kylie	you shouldn't even need the raid config file, although I think it does have some effect on detecting arrays on system startup
