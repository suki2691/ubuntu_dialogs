2009-12-16T03:39:00.000Z	georgij_		Is there any WINDOW MANAGER that uses bitmaps and pngs for the titlebar and corners etc? Like I can do in Compiz with emerald?
2009-12-16T03:40:00.000Z	soreau	georgij_	Why not use compiz and emerald?
2009-12-16T03:40:00.000Z	georgij_	soreau	because they are a pain and so much memory and stuff
