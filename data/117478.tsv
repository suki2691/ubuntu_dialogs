2008-07-14T21:43:00.000Z	keanu		I'm having problems playing music from my DNS-323 (NAS).  I've tried playing both FLAC and MP3 on Amarok, VLC, Totem, and xine, and all four act like they're starting to play, but don't.  skipping to the next track causes each to freeze.  I've rebooted both this laptop and the DNS-323 with no fix.  Same music plays fine on the windows laptop.  Ideas?
2008-07-14T21:44:00.000Z	Seveas	keanu	does it play when you first copy the music to a local disk?
2008-07-14T21:49:00.000Z	Seveas	keanu	that could be a codec problem. Install mplayer/ffmpeg/w32codecs and try with mplayer
