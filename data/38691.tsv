2011-04-29T14:39:00.000Z	petey	mbrochh	no probs - obviously unity doesn't work so well unless you fullscreen it unless you disable the auto-hide
2011-04-29T14:57:00.000Z	petey	mbrochh	I had some similar problems I think when switching out of seamless mode, changing to the scale mode a few times seemed to sort it out
