2008-08-26T07:22:00.000Z	misteralexander		I'm trying to 'mount' an internal hard drive in ' / ' and having a hell of time.  I've tried WIKI's and the Ubuntu Help site. How do you do this? I'm using UBUNTU LINUX - Hardy

2008-08-26T07:26:00.000Z	_Zeus_	misteralexander	congrats
2008-08-26T07:31:00.000Z	_Zeus_	misteralexander	please don't put [] around the username; it's much better to just put the username and a : like everyone else
