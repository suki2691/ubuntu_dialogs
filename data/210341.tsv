2011-07-25T22:39:00.000Z	Pyraine		3 days in a row nobody has been able to help me :(, does noone at all know about sound cards?
2011-07-25T22:40:00.000Z	linxeh	Pyraine	what soundcard, and what problem?
2011-07-25T22:41:00.000Z	Pyraine	linxeh	I'm not sure, I've tweaked around in pulseaudio and alsamixer and nothing seems to be muted.
2011-07-25T22:43:00.000Z	Pyraine	linxeh	but in Windows, the sound preferences seems to detect the sub woofer and stereo speakers as two separate devices and I can only run one at a time, I don't mind losing the sub woofer, but I can't even do that on Ubuntu
