2011-09-18T16:13:00.000Z	codemagician		how I setup my bash shell so that directories I create have no other permissions by default?
2011-09-18T16:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	codemagician	 they always have some permissions and owner.. what permission do you want totm to have.
2011-09-18T16:15:00.000Z	codemagician	dr_willis	I'd like my directories to be drwxrwx---
2011-09-18T16:15:00.000Z	codemagician	dr_willis	in other words, the group and me can access them by default
