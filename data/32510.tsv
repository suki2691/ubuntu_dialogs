2010-05-05T03:16:00.000Z	Bravo		So, I installed windows 7 onto a partition after Ubuntu, I normally do it the other way around and so the Ubuntu loader takes over. However, this time the Windows 7 loader took over and Ubuntu isn't an option. What's the best way to go about getting the grub loader back?
