2012-01-22T01:09:00.000Z	mercury_	LjL	well, I already have a pxe server I use to install ubuntu with.  works great.  What I need is a network troubleshooter. I need to boot ubuntu from the network as a liveCD, instead of from a flash disk
2012-01-22T01:09:00.000Z	mercury_	LjL	RIP linux does this, but ubuntu doesn't. I'm trying to find out where I should go to find someone who knows how to make it do that.
