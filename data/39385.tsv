2010-04-05T03:21:00.000Z	brous-kee		i tried to install Ubuntu 9.1 with an existing Fedora 11, am not quite successful yet.. 9.1 requires ext4 too like fedora or not?
2010-04-05T03:22:00.000Z	wgrant	brous-kee	Ubuntu 9.10 defaults to ext4, but it will run on just about anything.
2010-04-05T03:23:00.000Z	wgrant	brous-kee	I wouldn't advise sharing /home between different distros, but it should probablymostly work.
2010-04-05T03:24:00.000Z	brous-kee	wgrant	i tried the install with sharing /home, and yep it messed up the existing fedora, somehow i ended up with that deleted ICEauthority file,
