2007-03-01T06:13:00.000Z	linuxnewbie756		I have over 700 .RST files in a folder i would like renamed to .txt files, how would i do that?
2007-03-01T06:14:00.000Z	Archville	linuxnewbie756	mv *.RST{,.txt)
2007-03-01T06:14:00.000Z	Archville		but i'm not sure it will work, so try it before with a few files
2007-03-01T06:15:00.000Z	linuxnewbie756	Archville	I don't understand, the folder path is /home/matt/Desktop/Here, so what exactly would i type in in terminal?
