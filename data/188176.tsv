2006-10-30T06:10:00.000Z	Jen20		Trying to download the directory shortcut ftp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/edgy/ubuntu-6.10-alternate-i386.iso in FTP client gives "550 Failed to change directory. Could not retrieve directory listing". Anyone know of the location of the alt *file* to download via FTP?
2006-10-30T06:11:00.000Z	frying_fish	Jen20	try wget

2006-10-30T06:13:00.000Z	frying_fish	Jen20	oh, well in that case, try another client is all I can suggest really
