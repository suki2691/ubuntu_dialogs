2006-02-26T08:57:00.000Z	phor2zero		I'm looking for a good linux dist to install on a 566Mhz celeron...  the ubuntu live-cd is TOO-SLOW.  Will it work if I install it?
2006-02-26T08:57:00.000Z	ohgood	phor2zero	livecd's are inherently slow. installed is always faster
2006-02-26T08:58:00.000Z	phor2zero	ohgood	 would you expect ubuntu to run okay on an old 566Celeron w/178MB Ram?.. or is there another dist that would work better?
2006-02-26T08:59:00.000Z	ohgood	phor2zero	it would be fine. i would likely use fluxbox for a windowmanager though
