2009-08-24T22:46:00.000Z	carrie_555		Can someone help me with DynDNS? I have a domain from dyndns. The problem is that I always have to login to the dyndns in order to refresh the ip. I believe that I should install something in my ubuntu to "tell" dyndns which is my current ip.. Does anyone know what should I do? If i have to install a program, which one should I install and how to configure it?
