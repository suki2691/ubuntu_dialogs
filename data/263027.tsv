2006-09-08T16:39:00.000Z	mjr	jay_	no fundamental difference; different libraries are available by default, some of which may be available as separate installs for the other too (and some not)
2006-09-08T08:01:00.000Z	mjr	jay_	yeah, what erUSUL said. For the bulk of any practical purposes, GNU/Linux is an Unix OS though.
2006-09-18T10:11:00.000Z	mjr	jay_	likely not
