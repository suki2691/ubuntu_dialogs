2004-11-11T16:51:00.000Z	Aard	sander	what about getting all those names from apt-cache search and piping it to apt-get install?
2004-11-11T16:51:00.000Z	sander	Aard	that might be a good one!
2004-11-11T16:53:00.000Z	Aard	sander	you can find out what's installed with apt-cache and/or apt-show-versions ;)
