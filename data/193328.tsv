2008-01-18T06:04:00.000Z	Humanzy		Hey guys, Feisty has seriously destroyed my whole system, I had flash worked, it now crashs all the time, and doesn't play audio at all.  Azereus doesn't work anymore, and whenever I try moving files around in the graphical display for too long the whole thing fails and I can't view the contents of any folders or open any file because linux can no longer recognize the file type
2008-01-18T06:05:00.000Z	Humanzy		i'm seriously considering just installing xp again
