2010-10-04T02:43:00.000Z	unknown		hi,  currently i am using ubuntu 10.04 - karmic,  but i would like to use some packet (which is newer version) from maverick, can i do that?
2010-10-04T02:44:00.000Z	glebihan	unknown	that is possible but not recommended
2010-10-04T02:44:00.000Z	unknown	glebihan	well i would like to install just this packet form maverick repository, then i would change it back
2010-10-04T02:45:00.000Z	glebihan	unknown	well you can try it, but you'll probably get some dependencies issues
