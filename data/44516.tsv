2009-11-26T03:28:00.000Z	MackRider		Anyway.  I set up and installed a fresh copy of UBUNTU 9.10 with hopes of running it as a web server for some of my local pet projects.  I figured I would install LAMP, however in the software center LAMP is not listed.  How do I install PHP, MySQL, etc. so that I can set this up as a web server?
