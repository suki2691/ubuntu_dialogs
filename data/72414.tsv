2010-06-01T06:04:00.000Z	loddon		Isn't acroread the package for Adobe Reader? It is in the search list but when I try to install, the msg says "Package acroread is not available, but is referred to by another package. This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source "
