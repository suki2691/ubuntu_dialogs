2007-07-02T05:58:00.000Z	Bogaurd		I just tried to compile a kernel... but for some reason the directory ended up being around 3gb. any ideas why?
2007-07-02T05:59:00.000Z	PriceChild	Bogaurd	we don't really support custom kernels
2007-07-02T05:59:00.000Z	Bogaurd	PriceChild	yeah... I know :-(
2007-07-02T05:59:00.000Z	Bogaurd	PriceChild	I really dont want to compile it, but I need IFB support, which is not in the ubuntu kernel otherwise..
