2008-05-27T02:37:00.000Z	gwern		ok, since no one has any useful advice for me, I have a general question. why does ubuntu by default make filesystems mount read-only on error, if X and everything else utterly fails when / is read-only?
2008-05-27T02:38:00.000Z	gwern		I mean, wouldn't it make sense to at least mount /tmp in ram, so you could do *something*? livecds manage just fine without a writable disk
2008-05-27T02:39:00.000Z	crimsun	gwern	feel free to propose it via brainstorm/blueprint
2008-05-27T02:39:00.000Z	gwern	crimsun	I suppose I'll do that... if I get my system working again
