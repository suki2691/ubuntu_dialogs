2012-10-25T17:13:00.000Z	carl__		I updated last night and after doing so I could not access my Folders from file manager
2012-10-25T17:14:00.000Z	carl__		can anyone help?
2012-10-25T17:16:00.000Z	carl__		When I open file manager I see the folders but when I try to open one the screen goes dim and file manager closes after a long deley.
2012-10-25T17:18:00.000Z	kunji	carl__	that's not good... the file manager is crashing, I've got no idea why though (offhand) and I need to go to class, hopefully someone else can help further, good luck.
