2011-01-11T17:40:00.000Z	Ileden		Any idea why I can open a connection via network manager GUI, but trying to open it via CLI using "nmcli con up uuid [UUID]" only says: "Error: No suitable device found: no device found for connection 'Dna Default'." ? Once opened via GUI, dropping the connection with "nmcli con down uuid [UUID]" does work.
