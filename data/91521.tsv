2011-10-01T03:26:00.000Z	excelsior		so I'm converting an office from windows to ubuntu with the director's blessings. I'm starting by switching to dual booting. A couple of issues: some computers are using a wireless USB NIC, and they don't want to connect even with a direct line of sight with the wireless router. Should static IPs be an issue?
2011-10-01T03:27:00.000Z	rhizmoe	excelsior	don't dual boot. cutover with the most skilled first and work your way down so that there's plenty of people to help answer questions when the least skilled get their boxes. don't drag it out, tho.

2011-10-01T03:32:00.000Z	rhizmoe	excelsior	well, are they even getting detected? dmesg
