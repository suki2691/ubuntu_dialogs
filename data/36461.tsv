2010-03-01T14:48:00.000Z	Zus	arand	are they specifically personal pgp keys or would  a "specific" team have one how do they work?
2010-03-01T14:56:00.000Z	arand	Zus	Not completely sure, but I think everyone has a personal key, and if say, a team creates a ppa which has another associated key, the LP system will automatically accept all team-members' keys and re-sign with the ppa-key when any one of the mebers upload to the PPA (not sure, but I think that's how it works..)
