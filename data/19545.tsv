2011-02-20T09:18:00.000Z	GMH		is there a way for me to check my system info in ubuntu?
2011-02-20T09:20:00.000Z	GMH		was just thinking, in general, like, if there's something akin to how windows can tell me that, say, i'm running on a whatever processor with what speed and how much RAM total
2011-02-20T09:20:00.000Z	GMH		and some other info
2011-02-20T09:21:00.000Z	Starminn	GMH	Run in Terminal "uname -a" (typo'd your name the first time) -- if you want a GUI go to System->Administration->System Monitor
