2012-09-01T02:34:00.000Z	elvano		Alright, I reinstalled my Luibuntu and it still gives me "There is no such partition." and the grub resque commandline. Please help me out here

2012-09-01T02:41:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	elvano	there is a bootscript that can be run that will really tell us what we need to know, down load and run it and post the text in a pastebin. http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/
