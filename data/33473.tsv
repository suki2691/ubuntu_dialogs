2010-09-17T13:58:00.000Z	vaibhav1		I have installed Ubuntu 10.04 and now I wanted to install ubuntu 8.10 as dual boot.. Does it will install normally or do I have to make chages in grub??
2010-09-17T13:59:00.000Z	bazhang	vaibhav1	8.10 is end of life and unsupported
2010-09-17T14:02:00.000Z	bazhang	vaibhav1	8.10 is unsupported. choose another more recent version
2010-09-17T14:11:00.000Z	vaibhav1	bazhang	But the issue is only of Grub i guess, so normally if i reinstall grub from 10.04, it should work.
