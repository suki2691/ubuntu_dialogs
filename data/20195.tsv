2011-01-17T15:29:00.000Z	ryanf_109	akagi82	use sudo
2011-01-17T15:30:00.000Z	ryanf_109	akagi82	once I've installed I usually set a password for root by command "pswd root" and then use "su root" to use root.
2011-01-17T15:31:00.000Z	ryanf_109	akagi82	just be aware that unless you really have to I usually don't do anything with root since it has permissions to do a lot more and can really mess up things.
