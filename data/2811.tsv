2012-05-28T14:38:00.000Z	vladivar		i just installed 12.04 to my laptop and the cpu-battery performance is really horrible. usage is constantly jumping around 20-90 percents. what could be the reason? this machine perfomed really well on speed and battery sustain on win7.
2012-05-28T14:38:00.000Z	dr__willis	vladivar	 id check the forums and askubuntu.com for your exact make of laptop. there may be some known issues and work arounds.
2012-05-28T14:40:00.000Z	vladivar	dr__willis	will give it a shot. do you agree that its abnormal to have 20-90 percent of cpu usage on an idle machine with clean installation?
2012-05-28T14:41:00.000Z	dr__willis	vladivar	 theres been issues in the kernel/power saveing features with laptops for the last 2 releases or so. 12.04 fixed a lot of them. but new laptops keep comming out that the fixs dont work on.
