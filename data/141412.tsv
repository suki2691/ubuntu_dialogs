2008-06-16T05:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Zaiden	 i recall specific tools for Windows - that could uninstall DX9.. but err.. this is a Linux channel. :)
2008-06-16T05:24:00.000Z	Zaiden	Dr_Willis	I used a guide to install directx 9 in wine to see if it would fix a problem, but sadly it didn't, so now I'm wondering why my other applications won't run like they did before : /
2008-06-16T05:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Zaiden	 i would have to say it may be time to start over with a new .wine directory. last i tried somthing similer. it iddent work too good.  the Wine Channel may have better suggestions
