2008-09-08T02:37:00.000Z	jacklake		I'm back... and... the cd is right... I think it's some trouble with the distro (ubuntu 8.4.1 64 bits)
2008-09-08T02:39:00.000Z	jacklake		for exemple - at the documentation of help, it tell me to go system>Preferencies>Hardware info - I dont have this Hardware something option :(
2008-09-08T02:40:00.000Z	jacklake		the path is - System>Preferencies>hardware something (I can't quite remember) but there's nothing even close to it :(
2008-09-08T02:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	jacklake	some docs are outdated :(
