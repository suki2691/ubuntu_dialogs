2007-03-25T10:38:00.000Z	pike_	evolipel	you can see access points but not obtain an ip?
2007-03-25T10:40:00.000Z	pike_	evolipel	yeah make sure the switch is on so you can transmit.   what does 'sudo iwconfig eth1 essid whateverAPname; sudo dhclient eth1' say?   where eth1 is whatever your device name is.
