2007-10-20T00:57:00.000Z	bro		hi guys. i was wondering, is there any way to make filenames shorter in ubuntu [gutsy]? they seem too long for me, 2-3 lines. something with (...) just like on xp would be awsome.
2007-10-20T00:57:00.000Z	Dan2552	bro	what filenames?
2007-10-20T00:58:00.000Z	bro	Dan2552	the names of the files/folders. sorry, i probably said that wrong. my english is not that good.
2007-10-20T00:59:00.000Z	Dan2552	bro	maybe there's a ubuntu channel for your own country?
