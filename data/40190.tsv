2012-02-25T00:14:00.000Z	kenyabob		I sieged my server, and now I've been blocked. I can remote in, but I'm not sure what is doing the blocking. I flushed my iptables and I'm not sure what to try next
2012-02-25T00:14:00.000Z	martian	kenyabob	check your /etc/hosts.deny
2012-02-25T00:15:00.000Z	kenyabob	martian	and my ip would be added into that file? it looks like its still default to me
2012-02-25T00:16:00.000Z	martian	kenyabob	yeah, that would be the case. I guess that's not it. then :-/
