2010-02-06T20:55:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar		how can I get Gnome terminal or Terminator to open with, say, 100 lines in the window vs. the default?  Can't seem to see a preference for that
2010-02-06T20:56:00.000Z	tarzeau	k0d3g3ar	indeed, xterm can do it though
2010-02-06T20:56:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	tarzeau	 are you saying that Gnome terminal and/or Terminator can't do that?
2010-02-06T20:56:00.000Z	tarzeau	k0d3g3ar	i'm just saying i couldn't find an option for it in gnome terminal. no idea about terminator
