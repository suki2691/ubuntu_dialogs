2010-02-23T09:44:00.000Z	ZachF		hi folks, i moved from ubuntu to ArchLinux a few months ago and have greatly enjoyed the extra speed my system has gained by loosing the bloat, but not being a hugley *nix savvey user, i'm really starting to miss apt-* and the vast software repo's of ubuntu/debian. is there a way i can speed up my system using ubuntu, without loosing the usability?
2010-02-23T09:46:00.000Z	Sarrasine	ZachF	I'm in the same boat - Ubuntu is just too bloated for me as it ships. Just do like I do and simply open up Synaptic and cut everything you don't want/need.
2010-02-23T09:48:00.000Z	ZachF	Sarrasine	i would much rather it be the other way around! i have toyed with minimal (command line) installs, but desktop intergration never seems to work quite right that way.. i was wondering if there is a way to install the core ubuntu OS without any extra software (all the editors and misc apps etc)
