2011-04-20T12:25:00.000Z	LLStarks		anyone? i have zero tty access and can only boot to x.
2011-04-20T12:26:00.000Z	stimpie	LLStarks	I had something similar
2011-04-20T12:27:00.000Z	stimpie	LLStarks	I had to install startup manager and change the boot display resolution
2011-04-20T12:28:00.000Z	stimpie	LLStarks	ofcours that could be solved without startup manager (but I dont know  how exactly)
