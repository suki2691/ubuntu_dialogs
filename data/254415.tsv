2005-03-16T12:27:00.000Z	monoxide	Hikaru79	i believe there is a driver on sourceforge that allows that, but out of the box, no.
2005-03-16T12:27:00.000Z	Hikaru79	monoxide	allows which one? Both?
2005-03-16T12:28:00.000Z	monoxide	Hikaru79	tell me if you find something. i wanna run a ubuntu/XP dualboot on here.
