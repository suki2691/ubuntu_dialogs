2006-12-20T08:13:00.000Z	lavid		where can i get the patchfile applied to the vanilla kernel to make it the 64bit kernel? I'm looking for the patchfile and not the patched sources. Thanks.

2006-12-20T08:15:00.000Z	lavid	kitche	i'm looking to compile a kernel that doesn't have certain parts removed that seem to be removed in the 64bit ubuntu kernel
