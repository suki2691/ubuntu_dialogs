2011-09-16T22:18:00.000Z	toumbo		Hi people!Is anyone available to solve together my little issue?
2011-09-16T22:20:00.000Z	toumbo		Ok here is my question again: how to intergrate gnome player with my chromium?It says "missing plugin" although I installed it!
2011-09-16T22:22:00.000Z	ben_unity	toumbo	in firefox there is something to define what it does with files, you could look up 'chromium setting file uses' or something along those lines
2011-09-16T22:23:00.000Z	toumbo	ben_unity	okay I'll try it!Thanks for the response!
