2009-07-07T14:34:00.000Z	andenw_	shruggar	the PHP packages in the main 9.04 repositories will not be updated to newer versions. Perhaps someone are backporting them though
2009-07-07T14:35:00.000Z	shruggar	andenw_	I wouldn't expect the packages to be "updated", since 5.3 isn't backwards-compatible. I meant when are there going to be /new/ packages added
2009-07-07T14:36:00.000Z	andenw_	shruggar	new packages aren't added to released ubuntu releases.
