I did try few things peaple on this channel told me to try like reconfiguring my xserver-xorg but no luck. system just hangs  just before it would startx. I see quite few errors at the beginning but dont know where to look

2006-03-05T17:25:00.000Z	djkrikke		are you sure you have chosen the right options
2006-03-05T17:29:00.000Z	xukun	djkrikke	soundray there is no errors that I can see in /var/log/Xorg.0.log. Its also not possible to startx becoouse the system hangs before it should startx. I can only boot with recovery mode
