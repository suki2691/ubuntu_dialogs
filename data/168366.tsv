2007-10-23T03:46:00.000Z	gumby600m	Reng	 look in /etc/fstab and make sure you have permissions to write to the drive
2007-10-23T03:50:00.000Z	gumby600m	Reng	 I think the "umask=XXX" gives you the permissions...  I know that "umask=007" is read-only
2007-10-23T03:50:00.000Z	gumby600m	Reng	 I would try googling "/etc/fstab umask write permissions" or something like that
