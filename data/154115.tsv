2007-11-06T21:31:00.000Z	Codenut		I am having a terrible time creating a boot cd from the 7.04 iso. I downloaded it and it is all there.
2007-11-06T21:33:00.000Z	Codenut		Can I just upgrade my copy of Debian Sarge all the way to ubuntu 7.04?
2007-11-06T21:34:00.000Z	b1f30_w0rk	Codenut	yes - but you'll probably have to google for the HOWTO
