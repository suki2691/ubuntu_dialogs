2011-08-10T13:00:00.000Z	HazLT	farciarz84	i think u have in mind ubuntu 11.04. U can do it by loging off and loging in as a Ubuntu Classic session
2011-08-10T13:00:00.000Z	HazLT		i have a problem: when connecting to the internet with wireless adapter (D-Link DWA-125) i connect to the internet with no problem, i can browse, but after 10-15 minutes connection lost. Even then i restart my pc, i can't connect anymore. The only solution is to restart a router. So i guess the problem is in router. P.S. there is no problem on Windows 7 and everything fine then i connect through ethernet connection. I have Ubuntu 11.04. Can someone
2011-08-10T13:01:00.000Z	farciarz84	HazLT	no I have in mind 11.10 cause 11.04 doesn't support my sandy bridge machine with integrated intel sandy bridge GPU
