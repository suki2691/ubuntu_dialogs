2012-02-02T21:54:00.000Z	Bonaparte		I'm unable to start MySQL service on Ubuntu 11.1. `service mysql start` gives error: start: Job failed to start
2012-02-02T21:56:00.000Z	Bonaparte		How can I fix my MySQL issue? It's a local box with no important data. I also tried removing and installing. There are some errors in dpkg
2012-02-02T21:57:00.000Z	Bonaparte		http://paste2.org/p/1892043  - these are the errors
