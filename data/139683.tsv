2009-04-05T21:07:00.000Z	YixilTesiphon		stupid question: how do I find out what my wireless card is within ubuntu 9.04?
2009-04-05T21:07:00.000Z	YixilTesiphon		I know it is some kind of atheros, which is a whole other problem, but obviously I need to find out waht it is before researching
2009-04-05T21:08:00.000Z	YixilTesiphon		it has already suggested using the madwifi driver, though, so I know it can find the wireless card
