2007-07-22T08:48:00.000Z	arpegius		is there a standard list of dev packages to install when building items from source?
2007-07-22T08:48:00.000Z	arpegius		gcc, etc....
2007-07-22T08:48:00.000Z	arpegius		i ask because i don't yet have them installed and i'm looking for a solid list that will take care of most dependencies
