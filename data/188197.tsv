2006-06-12T10:31:00.000Z	Snurf		If I log into SSH and wget a file that is very big and will take awhile, can I close the SSH window and will the server keep getting the file?

2006-06-12T10:31:00.000Z	sparkleytone	Snurf	such as "screen wget blahblah"
2006-06-12T10:31:00.000Z	sparkleytone	Snurf	then you detach the screen using ctrl-d
