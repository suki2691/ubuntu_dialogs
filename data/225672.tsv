2006-10-28T15:58:00.000Z	levander	puff	not if you didn't change the hardware under the kernel you don't
2007-06-08T10:59:00.000Z	levander	puff	you've looked at the discs, and they are clean?  could try a dvd cleaner (not a disc cleaner) - a dvd cleaner is a disc you put in your drive to clean it
2007-06-08T11:00:00.000Z	puff	levander	The disks are brand new, so yeah.  I could see a dvd cleaner helping.  I haven't really used my CD/DVD reader/writer hardly at all, but the laptop is 1.5 years old.
