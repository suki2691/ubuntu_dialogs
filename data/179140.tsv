2011-01-13T23:50:00.000Z	saxon		hello all, I'm new to ubuntu and currently have the 10.10 32bit installed. However I want to install the 64bit so that I can run Win7 64bit in Virtualbox. Is the 64bit Ubuntu more or less the same as the 32bit in terms of drivers etc?
2011-01-13T23:50:00.000Z	jrib	saxon	are you sure you need 64bit ubuntu?  Did you ask vbox?
