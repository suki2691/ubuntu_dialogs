2005-07-18T10:19:00.000Z	jasoncohen		i see an ip from russia in last -d. it appears this person logged into my machine but the only port i have open that would allow remote access is ssh and that isn't accessible from the internet - plus it's public key only
2005-07-18T10:19:00.000Z	jasoncohen		does last -d mean a successful login attempt was made?
