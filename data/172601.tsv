2006-08-01T06:40:00.000Z	Zambezi		I need help from a really skilled person now. I can't make a folder i mnt without sudo. I know I'm not suposed to change the right in home, so what can I do?
2006-08-01T06:42:00.000Z	MaxL	Zambezi	I beleive MSN works in Wine or Cedega?
2006-08-01T06:43:00.000Z	Zambezi	MaxL	I'm not sure about that, but why use Windowsapplications when there is Linuxversion. Games is another point, there is Cedega or Wine the only options.
2006-08-01T06:44:00.000Z	Zambezi	MaxL	I use Gaim so I can't help you with that.
