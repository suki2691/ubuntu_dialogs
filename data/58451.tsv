2009-07-28T12:32:00.000Z	Innxis		Hello! I have a problem with my keyboard. If I press CTRL, ALT or SHIFT, the keyboard signals sent to the computer doesn't work. For example, if I press CTRL, I hear a bios sound and if I start typing, nothing happens. Also, the mouse gets affected as well, left click having the same action as right click.

2009-07-28T12:34:00.000Z	Innxis		Some help on my topic, please?
