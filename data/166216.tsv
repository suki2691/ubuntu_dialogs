2007-12-13T21:23:00.000Z	ethercrap		I have a little big problem with my ethernet adapter and the latest ubuntu distros -including feisty and gutsy-... I can resolve domain names, I can ping them but I CANNOT connect with any website... I wish to know if anyone here had this problem...thanks for advance.
2007-12-13T21:23:00.000Z	ethercrap		By the other hand, I can connect to the Internet when I running any kernel on recovery mode....
