2008-05-31T13:25:00.000Z	somedude		but is it better to get 64 bit?
2008-05-31T13:25:00.000Z	badkitty	somedude	32 would be fine.. you could use 64 if you want
2008-05-31T13:27:00.000Z	badkitty	somedude	I just got a new quad core and used the same amd64 disc from the old install. Im sure it would be fine, but I doubt you'll notice a difference with 64 compared to 33
