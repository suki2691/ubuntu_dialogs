2011-05-23T03:48:00.000Z	wonginator1221		I think there's a memory leak somewhere

2011-05-23T03:53:00.000Z	wonginator1221	escott	I'm currently using 8 gigs of ram (I don't have a swap partition) and I caught nautilus using over 850MBs of ram the other day.  It ran me into a situation where I was getting memory allocation errors (no more memory available).  I restarted nautilus and the problem seemed to subside, but it seemed really odd that nautilus was using more ram than firefox with 15 tabs open.
