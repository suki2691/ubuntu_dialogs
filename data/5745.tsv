2012-02-08T00:29:00.000Z	doolly		Hey i'm at the ubuntu repositories. I'm a bit dissapointed that i have to manually dl dependencies for some packages. I'm doing this away from my linux desktop and I can't check to see if I have all the dependencies. Anywho, is there a way I can accumulate all packages i need and dl it all at once?
