2010-10-30T16:10:00.000Z	redsandro	sinisterstuf	I thought I'd create one big volume out of my old small annoying disks, for my media center. It's okay if one disk dies and I lose the contents on that disk. But if I lose the entire volume, and PhotoRec leaves me with a thousand nameless files, it's too much risk/trouble.
2010-10-30T16:10:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	redsandro	are your disks likely to fail?
2010-10-30T16:11:00.000Z	redsandro	sinisterstuf	Well at least they are prone to fail. Two are okay and two have a nice collection of reallocated sectors
