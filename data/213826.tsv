2007-04-19T11:59:00.000Z	`ph8		hey guys! i've recently updated to the latest feisty (been using feisty for quite some time, so this was just a routine dist-upgrade) and suddenly ever dialog doesn't have a titlebar anymore! sounds weird i know.. so i can resize windows but not move them or close them with the X (because there's no titlebar)
2007-04-19T11:59:00.000Z	`ph8		any idea what could be wrong?
2007-04-19T11:59:00.000Z	`ph8		i've tried a backup tried-and-proven xorg.conf to no avail
