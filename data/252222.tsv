2005-01-24T17:30:00.000Z	katharine		Howdy. I'm in the midst of rescuing a dead laptop harddrive -- using an ubuntu (warty) system to rescue a dead ubuntu (hoary) system. I've just copied over my .phoenix directory. However, starting up doesn't get me my information. Furthermore, calling firefox with the SelectProfile option doesn't do anything. Any ideas?
