2011-01-23T21:35:00.000Z	Vinck		Hey, new switcher: Trying to boot the live CD on my macbook pro, using refit and following numerous guides, can't get the CD to boot at all. I see the ubuntu logo and a loading animation, and when I hit esc to see what's going on, I am spammed with error messages of varying degree (unable to read, etc). Any ideas?

2011-01-23T21:38:00.000Z	PeterNL	Vinck	you could definately try from usb, it even might be faster, cheaper and produce less noise :)
2011-01-23T21:38:00.000Z	Vinck	PeterNL	Cheers, haha. I'll go off and play with that for a bit. Hopefully you wont see me again
