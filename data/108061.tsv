2007-12-31T04:24:00.000Z	Mikeee		is anybody else having problems getting Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG working on "latest" 7.10?
2007-12-31T04:25:00.000Z	theatrus	Mikeee	no problems with it, in a Thinkpad T60
2007-12-31T04:26:00.000Z	Mikeee	theatrus	I got it to work a few times, but now I've tried pretty much all the stuff I can think of - to no avail
2007-12-31T04:27:00.000Z	Mikeee	theatrus	I'm running WPA2/TKIP... are you also using encryption, and if so, WPA2 as well?
