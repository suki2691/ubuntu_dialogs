2010-05-17T03:02:00.000Z	twbst		Hello, this is my first time using this software so please be patient with me. I am also sort of new with Ubuntu. My problem is that I cannot upgrade to 10.04. The upgrade didn't work for me and I made 2 CDs and neither of them worked either. Does any one have potential solutions?
2010-05-17T03:03:00.000Z	twbst		I get errors when I try to upgrade and the CDs won't install. My PC ignores the cd
2010-05-17T03:03:00.000Z	twbst		Yes, from 9.1
2010-05-17T03:03:00.000Z	kjele	twbst	Desktop cd's?
