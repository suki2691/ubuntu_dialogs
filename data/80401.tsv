2008-12-08T13:01:00.000Z	ddoom		somehow i've managed to disable the network when the comp restarts, anyone know how to fix this? (ubuntu 8.04 server)
2008-12-08T13:02:00.000Z	_2	ddoom	you mean like sudo ifup eth0  ???
2008-12-08T13:03:00.000Z	ddoom	_2	yes thats what I have to do everytime the comp restarts, I want the network to be enabled without having to do that
