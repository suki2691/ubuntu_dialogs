2012-07-26T15:25:00.000Z	fidel_	Guest89896	have you checked if thunar exists/is installed on your box?
2012-07-26T15:29:00.000Z	fidel_	Guest89896	as answered before  - have you checked if thunar itself exists on your computer?
2012-07-26T15:30:00.000Z	fidel_	Guest89896	and it should be most likely /usr/bin/thunar not Thunar
