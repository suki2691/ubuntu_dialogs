2007-11-29T05:55:00.000Z	zanzer7	jrib	sorry, I changed my nick from zacharias - but I still have a problem running xflock4
2007-11-29T05:56:00.000Z	jrib	zanzer7	I don't know what xflock4 is
2007-11-29T05:56:00.000Z	zanzer7	jrib	actually no, my problem "magically disappeared" when I uninstalled xscreensaver - suddenly xflock4 (a sort of xlock, for xfce) recognises gnome-screensaver. Thanks!
