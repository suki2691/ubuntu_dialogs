2010-01-14T21:14:00.000Z	Yanick_		hi. I just tried to change my Ubuntu server 9.10 network settings from DHCP to static, and no the server won,t boot. It's stuck at "init: network-interface (eth0) post-stop process (662) terminated with status 1" ... same thing in recovery mode... how can I boot my server and fix this?
2010-01-14T21:16:00.000Z	Yanick_		anyone?
2010-01-14T21:16:00.000Z	rougedemon	Yanick_	Can you boot from a CD and edit the /etc/network/interfaces files manually?
