2007-12-02T04:22:00.000Z	k4k	dfwlinuxguy	I believe it does as long as your user has the ability to use a modem
2007-12-02T04:24:00.000Z	k4k	dfwlinuxguy	I agree, but I don't know how to do it with gnome-network-manager because I have never used a ppp connection
2007-12-02T04:26:00.000Z	k4k	dfwlinuxguy	actually, I just went over to my server and looked, it does allow you to setup a modem connection
