2011-02-08T11:26:00.000Z	watermaster		help, I installed 10.04 64-bit.  Firefox was really slow on it.  I successfully installed FF4 beta, hoping it would speed up.  I can run FF4, but it is just as slow.  Chromium is fast, though.  should I switch to 32-bit FF?
2011-02-08T11:27:00.000Z	wildbat	watermaster	no FF IS slow....:<
2011-02-08T11:28:00.000Z	watermaster		no, but its slower in on this 'puter than it is on other Linux boxen or Windows.... this is not normal, I use FF all the time across many systems, this is aberrant
