2006-11-05T17:22:00.000Z	Michae1		hello is there a specific channel for wireless networking support or should I just ask in here?
2006-11-05T17:23:00.000Z	Michae1		Ok I checked the forums already. I am just trying to find out which encryption is best supported (if any) in Ubuntu Edgy.  I would like to use at least WEP but even with that I don't seem to be able to connect.

2006-11-05T17:24:00.000Z	Michae1	crimsun	yes wifi. Ok my chipset is likely quite old. :-/
