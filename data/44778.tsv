2010-03-30T11:02:00.000Z	mouse		I'm dual booting ubuntu 9.10 and windows vista.  How difficult is it to shrink the windows partition and increase ubuntu's?  If I shrink the windows partition, will ubuntu's automatically increase to fill the gap?
2010-03-30T11:03:00.000Z	knoppies	mouse	you using the gparted gui?
2010-03-30T11:03:00.000Z	mouse	knoppies	I don't believe so.
2010-03-30T11:06:00.000Z	mouse	knoppies	What I was thinking of doing was shrinking windows through their partition shrink tool then reboot into ubuntu.  Would gparted handle both partitions?
