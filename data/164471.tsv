2006-10-13T09:31:00.000Z	Refoyl		Hello all.  I have a compaq laptop with the ATI Radeon express 200M card.  If I boot (Dapper) with a monitor or projector attached to the VGA port, the port is live and clones the screen, which is what I want.  If I boot with nothing connected to the VGA port, the port is dead and nothing I do (fn-f4, for instance) seems to raise it, whether I am in X-Windows or in plain terminal mode.  Must I always reboot, or is there some way to restart this

2006-10-13T09:32:00.000Z	Refoyl	kmaynard	thanks; I guess I can try playing with the BIOS.
