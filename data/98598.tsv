2010-08-21T21:34:00.000Z	jaybee		I've just realised my host has done this, wtf do I want a 400+GB home for on a server?
2010-08-21T21:34:00.000Z	jaybee		but only a 4GB var?
2010-08-21T21:34:00.000Z	dios_mio	jaybee	well the only advantage is that when you install a new system, you will keep your home files
