2012-08-08T08:53:00.000Z	phonebook_		is there a step by step tutorial for ubuntu? i beyond basic command line and basic gui stuff
2012-08-08T08:53:00.000Z	zamn	phonebook_	what do you mean? you want to learn more about command line utilities/
2012-08-08T08:55:00.000Z	zamn	phonebook_	so you just want to learn more about linux in general..not specifically ubuntu
2012-08-08T08:56:00.000Z	zamn	phonebook_	it is an easy process. sudo apt-get upgrade sun-java7-openjdk (or whateer the package is called)
