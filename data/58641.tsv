2009-05-01T19:48:00.000Z	Phisbut		The upgrade manager says installing the upgrade can take several hours, yet a fresh install takes less than 30 minutes... is an upgrade really that much longer than an install?
2009-05-01T19:49:00.000Z	rjune	Phisbut	upgrade has to download everything
2009-05-01T19:49:00.000Z	Phisbut	rjune	if I upgrade from the alternate CD, is it still that long?
2009-05-01T19:49:00.000Z	rjune	Phisbut	probably not.
