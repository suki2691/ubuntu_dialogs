I used to have a WEP network but now I'm connecting to a WPA-PSK one. Although it seems to connect OK, could this be the problem?

2007-09-12T12:23:00.000Z	davetarmac	gordonjcp	does it sound to you that it could be causing my system to lockup?
2007-09-12T12:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	davetarmac	unlikely, but if that's the only change you've made since the problem started...
