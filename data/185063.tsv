2006-08-14T07:26:00.000Z	Pupeno		my wife is doing some work in which she pastes lot's of text from mails and other places, most of the on UTF-8 and pastes it on lyx, but Lyx uses Latin-1, so she ends up with a lot of weird characters. Any ideas how to solve the problem ? something that is agile ?

2006-08-14T07:27:00.000Z	Pupeno	RadiantFire	I do not want not to use UTF-8, I've been slowly turning everything into UTF-8, I won't go back, it is monthes of work.
