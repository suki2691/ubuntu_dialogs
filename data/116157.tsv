2008-04-06T01:39:00.000Z	zcat[1]	ahave	'partitioning' and 'formatting' are two different things.. it takes no time to write a new partiton table.. and it should only take a few seconds or a minute to 'format' -- you use mke2fs for that
2008-04-06T01:40:00.000Z	ahave	zcat[1]	i understand that. i used gparted instead of mke2fs to partition and format to NTFS. but afterward i can not see the drive in my /media dir
2008-04-06T01:41:00.000Z	ahave	zcat[1]	it had the option of 'format to NTFS'
