2007-04-27T06:08:00.000Z	DONDON		really quick question for anyone, how do i dictate what port i want to use in xchat when connection to a server?
2007-04-27T06:09:00.000Z	DONDON		i can't find it in the xchat faq anywhere =/. i know it's really easy, but i'm just dumb
2007-04-27T06:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	DONDON	the server setup screen has a Port box
2007-04-27T06:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	DONDON	actually, it doesn't. Sorry.
