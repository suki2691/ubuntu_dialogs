2008-02-02T15:50:00.000Z	CVirus		Why is the ipw3945 driver listed in the restrictred drivers manager though it is opensource ?
2008-02-02T15:52:00.000Z	Shyde	CVirus	it says "While this driver is mostly free, it relies on a piece of proprietary software to determine the channels your wireless card is permitted to use"
2008-02-02T15:56:00.000Z	CVirus	Shyde	got that ... thanks
2008-02-02T15:57:00.000Z	CVirus	Shyde	since the ipw3945 is deprecated ... why don't you guys use the new iwlwifi with Ubuntu ?
