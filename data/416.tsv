2012-11-13T12:58:00.000Z	nrw		there's only 2MB free on the internal drive. i'm assuming it's gonna download more than 2MB of stuff. i can't imagine the installer hunts for free disk space on other drives. does it?
2012-11-13T12:59:00.000Z	nrw		i have 376mb of ram. is there hope of fitting the whole system on that?
