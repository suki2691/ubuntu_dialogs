2009-04-06T02:59:00.000Z	taromsn	carbon13	If I use the recovery console method, will it still preserve my ability to boot into Ubuntu?
2009-04-06T02:59:00.000Z	carbon13	taromsn	no, but you can reinstall grub from linux boot cd
2009-04-06T03:02:00.000Z	taromsn	carbon13	So is there anything I should keep in mind when I try to install GRUB?
