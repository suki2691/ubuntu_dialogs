2006-06-06T10:56:00.000Z	roler		I currently run Debian on a Dell laptop that has an Intel 945GM / 950GMA video card... Debian just recently switched to Xorg 7.0 and for the life of me, I can't get the latest drm xorg drivers to compile... Thus my video is S L O W... I've heard that ubuntu has 945GM drm modules already compiled / ready to go. Can anyone confirm this?
