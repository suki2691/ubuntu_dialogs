2006-04-05T10:18:00.000Z	_jason	minn	hi, just ask your question
2006-04-05T10:20:00.000Z	_jason	minn	that sounds too compilcated for me.  I think your best course of option is to put all the information (errors) you can on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ , then provide a link here ofr other people to look at.  And if no one can help try ubuntuforums.org and the mailing list
