2006-10-12T06:30:00.000Z	Ryan_rj		Good night everyone
2006-10-12T06:30:00.000Z	Ryan_rj		I am just at Ubuntu's website right now.
2006-10-12T06:31:00.000Z	Ryan_rj		I'd like to ask you, how good is it with notebooks and should I download the "ubuntu-6.06.1-alternate-i386.iso" or the "ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386.iso" ???
