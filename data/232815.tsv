2009-11-22T19:21:00.000Z	Solarstone		I'm reading Java at University. I'm reading my first course so it was just learned how to compile in Windows. I have dualboot and I prefer to work in Ubuntu... But how do I compile Java in the terminal? Please give me the correct channel if I'm wrong. Thanks.
2009-11-22T19:23:00.000Z	Solarstone		I don't know how to compile either if I've installed JavaFX correct. May I change Channel or not?
