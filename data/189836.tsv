2006-12-27T15:52:00.000Z	LjL	jbjuly	which windows partition, what does it need to be recovered for
2006-12-27T15:56:00.000Z	jbjuly	LjL	even after I did a dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=2? I'm using a LiveCD right now in an external CD-ROM, I have a external HD, but the usb bay is occupied, I guess I'm really out of luck
2006-12-27T15:57:00.000Z	LjL	jbjuly	well, i can't say if it will work of course, but what about trying? the program looks like it's made for exactly that kind of situation
