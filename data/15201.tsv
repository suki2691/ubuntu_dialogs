2012-05-14T06:58:00.000Z	ms-daisy		I would like to use my secondary drive to store data from both windows and ubuntu files. Sounds like it needs to be formatted FAT.  Is there a backup program that anyone can recommend suited for this application?
2012-05-14T06:59:00.000Z	ms-daisy		OK, so if I format it NTFS, which backup program could copy the data from Ubuntu to the drive ActionParsnip  (or anyone else who might know)?
2012-05-14T07:00:00.000Z	ms-daisy		can you install rsync on a data hard drive with no OS ActionParsnip ?
