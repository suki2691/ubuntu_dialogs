2009-04-09T18:09:00.000Z	ziroday	fore	don't address people out of the blue. And AFAIK unless you want to hack around with the gnome-panel no.
2009-04-09T18:10:00.000Z	ziroday	fore	you can create a new menu in Applications, but not a new menu next to Places or System or whatever. Unless you want to hack around with the source code its not going to happen
2009-04-09T18:13:00.000Z	ziroday	fore	and as explained to you twice. Unless you make your own gnome panel applet its not going to happen.
