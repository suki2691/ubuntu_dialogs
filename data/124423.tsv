2012-05-13T04:09:00.000Z	PW-toXic		hi - i'm copying 670.000 files via copy and paste
2012-05-13T04:09:00.000Z	PW-toXic		I have already copied 300k files, and my computer is getting slower and slower... it is getting so slow, that i can hardly log in to the desktop
2012-05-13T04:10:00.000Z	PW-toXic		is there a system monitor like alt+ctrl+del in windows?
