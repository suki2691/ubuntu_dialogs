2012-02-29T07:14:00.000Z	Oredigger		Adobe Flash is no longer working in FireFox  I reinstalled the flash package, but that didn't help.  Any ideas?
2012-02-29T07:15:00.000Z	Oredigger		I'm not sure if it's site specific.  I'm having trouble loading this video http://www.thedailyshow.com/full-episodes/mon-february-27-2012-neil-degrasse-tyson
2012-02-29T07:17:00.000Z	bazhang	Oredigger	yep, not working here either. perhaps a new version of flash was just released
2012-02-29T07:19:00.000Z	Oredigger	bazhang	TY for the confirmation.  It's at least not just my machine.
