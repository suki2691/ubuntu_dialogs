2008-03-05T04:47:00.000Z	flowOver		why does firefox crash/lockup/freeze my desktop when i view flash?  it just started this behaviour today and i haven't changed anything for days
2008-03-05T04:47:00.000Z	l815	flowOver	I have the same problem, the solution i get is to reinstall flash
2008-03-05T04:48:00.000Z	l815	flowOver	lol i guess so, but that's what i was told. I haven't tried it yet though
2008-03-05T04:48:00.000Z	l815	flowOver	and I think there is another flash besides adobe you can install
