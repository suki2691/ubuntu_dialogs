2005-07-16T12:13:00.000Z	JDahl		Is Canonical making progress on the python scripting framework for Gnome tools (cf. the "python scripting everywhere" bounty)? That would be very useful...
2005-07-16T12:13:00.000Z	dougsk	JDahl	I've wondered to.  especially with sabayon etc getting some steam
2005-07-16T12:14:00.000Z	JDahl	dougsk	I'm interested in scripting for Gnumeric, and they have the same problem, namely that their Python interface is not quite good enough
2005-07-16T12:16:00.000Z	dougsk	JDahl	wow, right on. sounds interesting. dunno, tbh
