2006-01-17T14:06:00.000Z	CosmoDad_		is there no local mail traffic in Ubuntu as in Debian? Like security hints and stuff like that?
2006-01-17T14:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	CosmoDad_	install postfix -- i'm pretty sure it's on the CD. You might need/want mailx too
2006-01-17T14:08:00.000Z	CosmoDad_	HappyFool	is it regular on Ubuntu not being able to read root's mail without installing additional software? sounds weird..
2006-01-17T14:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	CosmoDad_	i think it's standard (i installed a few months ago, can't remember details). i think the idea is most desktop users will use evolution, and server users will know what they want
