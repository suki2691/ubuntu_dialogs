2009-02-16T20:29:00.000Z	djc_		I can find stuff on google, but I am looking for a few 'off the cuff' responses to: "Why Ubuntu? (And not Fedora, Suse, Debian, etc)"
2009-02-16T20:29:00.000Z	hmw	djc_	you can usually start programs in wine by simply double clicking them
2009-02-16T20:36:00.000Z	djc_	hmw	hrm.. what are the differences between ubuntu and debian?
2009-02-16T20:37:00.000Z	djc_	hmw	well.. maybe I will download the dvd and play with it... got a new HD for my machine..
