2012-05-16T23:15:00.000Z	jarek		where should I place Gtk3 themes?
2012-05-16T23:15:00.000Z	jarek		if I put them into ~/.themes/ then they are not showing in "Appearance" panel
2012-05-16T23:17:00.000Z	trism	jarek	the themes in System Settings/Appearance are hardcoded in 11.10-12.04, install gnome-tweak-tool to change the themes
