2009-03-05T09:41:00.000Z	LinuxRules		Can someone help me? I'm pissed. I booted off an ubuntu live CD to install ubuntu 8.10 onto a flash drive and it made my primary drive no longer bootable. I have no idea what the ubuntu installer would bugger up my boot drive
2009-03-05T09:41:00.000Z	LinuxRules		Is this  a known issue with Macbooks and ubuntu?
2009-03-05T09:42:00.000Z	LinuxRules		where does a boot loader install?
