2010-09-26T03:02:00.000Z	kazagistar		I have a netbook with no CD drive... can I use an SD card instead of a usb flash drive as the installation medium?
2010-09-26T03:02:00.000Z	_DGM_	kazagistar	yes you can :) i can confirm it works fine
2010-09-26T03:03:00.000Z	_DGM_	kazagistar	as long as the netbook wants to boot from sd its fine. However.. it might spam you with a lot of "cant read" stuff.. you can safely ignore it or disable "floppy disk emulation" in the bios.. either way it will install just fine
