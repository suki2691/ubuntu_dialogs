2006-07-19T16:13:00.000Z	zcat[1] _	Ackeubu_	apt-get remove irda-utils
2006-07-19T16:15:00.000Z	zcat[1] _	Ackeubu_	check /var/log/messages and /var/log/xorg.0.log  - one of those should tell you something anyhow.. in my case it was irda support, whick only gets loaded after gdm so it looked like gdm had a problem. took a while to figure out :)
