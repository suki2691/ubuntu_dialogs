2005-12-01T08:11:00.000Z	candlelight		just now I installed some updates to ubuntu, a message told me to reboot the system -- I thought linux doesn't need a reboot for update?
2005-12-01T08:11:00.000Z	LjL	candlelight	usually, it doesn't. it may sometimes
2005-12-01T08:14:00.000Z	candlelight	LjL	what kind of updates will need a reboot? I'm learning to use ubuntu as a server, hopefully no downtime.
