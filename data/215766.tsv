2006-11-29T13:20:00.000Z	greg		Anyone know about any issues with Ubuntu & Serpentine, specifically writing audio discs and recieving a "Success" dialog, but not actually writing to the CD?  I.E., putting the newly burned disc back in the player and seeing it read as a "Blank Disc"......... Just wondering.....
