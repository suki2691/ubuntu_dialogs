2006-03-03T17:48:00.000Z	nickrud	hokatichenci	if the sound card is properly supported, no (you may need to disable the onboard sound, if you have one)
2006-03-03T17:49:00.000Z	hokatichenci	nickrud	yeah thats the plan, I get a 300ms audio delay with this onboard sound and I think it has to do with the lack of hardware mixing
