2010-05-14T01:58:00.000Z	gatlin		I am creating an ubuntu remix for private internal use at my organization, and everything is working fine, but there are two refinements I wish to make: 1) startup gdm at boot and 2) replace the xfce4 config files with my own custom defaults
2010-05-14T01:59:00.000Z	gatlin		does anyone know how to do this?
2010-05-14T02:00:00.000Z	gatlin		is there another room I should go to? apologies for clogging this one
