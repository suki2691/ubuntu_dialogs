2007-08-16T06:53:00.000Z	dsl800		hi I'm trying to move stuff onto my ubuntu computer, does anyone have experience with ftp or smb?
2007-08-16T06:54:00.000Z	rapid	dsl800	what about ftp
2007-08-16T06:54:00.000Z	dsl800	rapid	I'm not sure how to use it. I want to transfer a directory and all it's contents recursively
2007-08-16T06:55:00.000Z	dsl800	rapid	I'm using smb, but it has the same interface as ftp aparently
