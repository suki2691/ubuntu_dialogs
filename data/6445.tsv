2012-01-15T02:12:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	HebusLeTroll	 may be a acpi issue

2012-01-15T02:14:00.000Z	HebusLeTroll	MonkeyDust	i don't use hibernation, just s3 standby. It seems to work (the power led blinks) and it wakes up fast. But when it wakes up i have to retype my pass, and all work is lost (due to logout)
