2006-06-28T07:43:00.000Z	spik		is it possible for me to stay on the bleeding edge with ubuntu?
2006-06-28T07:43:00.000Z	spik		or does ubuntu have the same problems as debian
2006-06-28T07:44:00.000Z	spik		example would be amarok, 1.3.9 is on repistory, 1.4 is out
2006-06-28T07:45:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spik	ubuntu is debian downstream - so it's even less bleeding edge than debian afaik
