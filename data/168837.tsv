2006-09-04T09:10:00.000Z	sharky		can someone explain this error to me: error while loading shared libraries: libncurses.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2006-09-04T09:11:00.000Z	sharky		i know i have libncurses.so.5 in /lib
2006-09-04T09:11:00.000Z	ChaosFan	sharky	it means what it says
2006-09-04T09:13:00.000Z	sharky	ChaosFan	is there a way to explicitly make the libnucurses.so.5 file be seen by the binary?
