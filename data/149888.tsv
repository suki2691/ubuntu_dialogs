2008-06-28T00:01:00.000Z	pgib		how do I figure out who the MOTU developer is for a particular package?  I am a developer and we are releasing an alpha. I want to give the maintainer a chance to update the package. Any ideas??  Thanks!
2008-06-28T00:03:00.000Z	pgib		anyways -  do I just need to contact a random MOTU developer?
2008-06-28T00:04:00.000Z	pgib		is there an ubuntu developer channel?
2008-06-28T00:05:00.000Z	Pici	pgib	There are a few, what are you looking for?
