2011-10-20T22:07:00.000Z	naftilos76		hi i did a clean install of ubuntu 11.10 and it hangs during power off. I have seen many similar references during googling. Does anyone have a fix?

2011-10-20T22:08:00.000Z	Aka-noob	naftilos76	since I'm on a dual boot its kind of a non issue for me but I haven't managed to find a fix for it either
