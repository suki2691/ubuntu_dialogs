2011-03-10T09:14:00.000Z	Fiveways		I'm getting ready to download the newest version of ubuntu because I can't find my iso anymore, any reason the 32-bit version is listed as "recommended"?
2011-03-10T09:14:00.000Z	Fiveways		Can't remember if I saw that there before or not, haha
2011-03-10T09:15:00.000Z	Fiveways		So if I just planning on using it on my 64-bit boxes then theres no reason I shouldnt get x64? Or is it one of those situations where the 32-bit version is probably more hassle-free in the long run?
