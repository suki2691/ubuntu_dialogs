2006-12-29T07:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	firepol	no, i always install it.
2006-12-29T07:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	firepol	main reason, Opera allows you to save ".mht" files, Firefox does not.  More or less, they are a snapshot of a website.  If I find a website with extremely useful info, I save it as an Mht to file with my backups
