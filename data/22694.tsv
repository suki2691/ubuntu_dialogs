2010-11-15T03:58:00.000Z	Kerrick		How do I select which Java Firefox uses?
2010-11-15T03:59:00.000Z	putrefaction	Kerrick	type about:plugins in the URL bar in firefox
2010-11-15T03:59:00.000Z	putrefaction		you can enable/disable all that in there
2010-11-15T04:03:00.000Z	Kerrick	putrefaction	that page is non-interactive, although it does indicate that I'm using IcedTea. I need to determine whether Firefox is using OpenJDK or Sun's Java, and I need to be able to switch between the two.
