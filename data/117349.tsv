2012-06-27T16:07:00.000Z	Ca11um		Can anybody recommend a simple SVN client for Ubuntu Server? I need it for compiling a C++ project
2012-06-27T16:08:00.000Z	geirha	Ca11um	sudo apt-get install subversion; svn help
2012-06-27T16:13:00.000Z	geirha	Ca11um	sounds like it's signed with a custom certificate authority
2012-06-27T16:14:00.000Z	geirha	Ca11um	Make sure the ca-certificates package is installed
