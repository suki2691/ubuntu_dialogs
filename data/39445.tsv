2010-10-03T19:18:00.000Z	dr0id		can I say the packages on ubuntu repos, are distributed packages by any chance heh ? :P

2010-10-03T19:23:00.000Z	dr0id	Thor^^	could you explain a bit more on distributed application? what it is exactly? is it some application that would run on all the nodes in the distributed system ?
