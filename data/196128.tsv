2006-04-07T13:21:00.000Z	seth		Does anyone have a bcm4306 working with the bcm43xx driver in Dapper? I can iwlist scan and see my access point; dmesg says "wlan0: link becomes ready"; however, I can't connect to the access point.
2006-04-07T13:21:00.000Z	LoCusF	seth	are you trying to use ndiswrapper?
2006-04-07T13:22:00.000Z	seth	LoCusF	no, hence I said "the bcm43xx driver"
2006-04-07T13:22:00.000Z	LoCusF	seth	oh
