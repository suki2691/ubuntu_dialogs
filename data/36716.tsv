2010-03-02T10:20:00.000Z	brjann	holyguyver	i'm not saying your filesystem is broken now. i'm merely recommending that you consider that for the future, that's all.

2010-03-02T10:23:00.000Z	brjann	holyguyver	the folder being corrupted and the filesystem being fine would seem to be mutually exclusive concepts
