2012-02-23T21:11:00.000Z	goose		are there any known issues with ubuntu's wireless drivers and tomato USB? I continually get d/c'ed from my wireless at my house every 2-3 minutes, but don't have issues anywhere else / with any other network.
2012-02-23T21:11:00.000Z	roasted	goose	I'm using ubuntu with tomato usb. No issues here. Are you using cable or dsl?
2012-02-23T21:13:00.000Z	goose	roasted	cable, but I don't get the issue on any other machines on my network, nor when I use my android's wireless tethering
