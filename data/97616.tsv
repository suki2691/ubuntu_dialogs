2010-03-16T23:04:00.000Z	ismetteren		My ubuntu installation has just started to fuck up today. Parts, or the whole, screen (the buttons, i can move the mouse but clicking dosent have an effect) freezes from time to time. Right now the only thing i can do is change window and write here. Anybody knows what this is?
