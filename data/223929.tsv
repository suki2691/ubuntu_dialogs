2005-09-18T08:19:00.000Z	fluffybunny_	mdke	what is hal and how can I fix it?
2005-09-18T08:20:00.000Z	mdke	fluffybunny_	i don't know much about it i'm afraid. I believe hal controls how your system reacts to new devices that are added to your system
2005-09-18T08:21:00.000Z	mdke	fluffybunny_	but i can't give you any concrete help I'm afraid
