2008-10-04T02:54:00.000Z	HyperFireRush		I was wondering when you are in the terminal how can you get a list off all the software you can download
2008-10-04T02:55:00.000Z	bobertdos	HyperFireRush	I'm not sure you'd ever WANT a list of ALL the software you can install. That would be an awfully long list :D Why do you ask?
2008-10-04T02:57:00.000Z	bobertdos	HyperFireRush	Use Synaptic or apt-cache. You will like either of those frontends much better.
