2011-11-05T10:59:00.000Z	soidexe		Hi I upgraded my 11.04 to 11.10 and my gnome 2.32 desktop doesn't show System menu and I can't right click on panels also. What would you do to fix that? I can't use unity...
2011-11-05T11:00:00.000Z	ooph	soidexe	the apparently official answer is "reinstall 10.04 (LTS) and use that until it becomes unsupported; at that point, either choose a new distro, or sit and cry because Canonical has decided we're not allowed to choose what we do with our own machines.

2011-11-05T11:01:00.000Z	ooph	soidexe	moving to a different distro has "solved" that issue for a large number of users.
