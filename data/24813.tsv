2010-10-07T11:30:00.000Z	Guest75897		I'm trying to get two computers to network through an AT&T 2Wire Modem.  How can I do that?  Right now, all I see is Windows Network at Places/Network?
2010-10-07T11:31:00.000Z	Guest75897		I installed Samba
2010-10-07T11:32:00.000Z	Guest75897		gechmong7, is there a button on top of the touchpad to turn it off?
2010-10-07T11:33:00.000Z	gechmog7	Guest75897	No, I don't see anything like that :(
