2012-09-16T14:27:00.000Z	kanliot		any reason or just confused
2012-09-16T14:27:00.000Z	nootilus	kanliot	because the CD image misses some updates ?
2012-09-16T14:28:00.000Z	nootilus	kanliot	actually I just set up ubuntu on this machine. sudo apt-get update didn't do anything, but sudo apt-get upgrade installed several megas of updates :)
