2012-07-30T18:58:00.000Z	Blazemore	slorbast	I usually buy my stuff from Amazon or Scan, because the good customer service is worth it over the suspiciously-cheap places, and they still are pretty cheap
2012-07-30T18:59:00.000Z	slorbast	Blazemore	Yeah, I guess I'll just stick with Amazon/Newegg cause this seems suspect.
