2010-11-14T03:44:00.000Z	newboon2age_	od3n_	i'm guessing that you need to switch the upgrade config to where it accepts nonLTS upgrades
2010-11-14T03:50:00.000Z	newboon2age_	od3n_	ActionParsnip and i are saying the same thing.  so if you don't want to do command line stuff, you can do the same thing in GUI by System->Synaptic->Settings->Repositories->Updates->Release Upgrade->Show new distribution releases: Normal Releases
