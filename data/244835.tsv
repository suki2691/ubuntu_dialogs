2005-03-24T09:38:00.000Z	heatxsink		I have a Audigy2 ZS sound card, when I ran warty it worked great, when I upgraded to hoary, it seems to still work but no sound is comming out of my speakers, I've checked the mixer channels like master and pcm, and they are both unmuted and at full volume, when I run xmms it plays with no problem, I also checked in Xmms to make sure the right output device was selected, and it works with either ALSA out, or OSS out.  HELP?
