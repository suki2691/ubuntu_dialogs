2011-10-07T07:48:00.000Z	gluonman		How can I create a shell from a shell script (bash) that I can port to Windows?
2011-10-07T07:50:00.000Z	TheEvilPhoenix	gluonman	 its a theoretical impossibility, because DOS != Bash
2011-10-07T07:51:00.000Z	TheEvilPhoenix	gluonman	 its not called a "shell" or "shell script" in windows.  tis called a batch file.  you'd need to look up the Windows coding for batch files
2011-10-07T07:53:00.000Z	gluonman	TheEvilPhoenix	I completely forgot about batch files.  At least now I know what I can google.  Thanks for that advice.
