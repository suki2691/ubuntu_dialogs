2009-05-14T13:15:00.000Z	ikonia	dyf	sounds like a problem with there server
2009-05-14T13:15:00.000Z	dyf	ikonia	it happens with more than one forum
2009-05-14T13:15:00.000Z	ikonia	dyf	if a site offers a php file to download rather than display it, it is normally because the web server you are viewing does not know how to handle that php extension
