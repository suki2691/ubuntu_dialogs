2011-03-08T02:12:00.000Z	corinth		Hey #ubuntu. How do I get my Firefox launcher in Unity to point to the Firefox 4 beta I have, instead of 3.x?
2011-03-08T02:14:00.000Z	corinth		I've even tried editing the Firefox menu item in alacarte, but to no avail.

2011-03-08T02:15:00.000Z	corinth	GeekyAdam	the "old" one (stable release)
