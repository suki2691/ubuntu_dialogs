2009-06-13T02:20:00.000Z	Oriax		hi, i have a little question... i downloaded ubuntu from ubuntu.no, burned the cd and started installing. when the install was almost finished, a message came up saying something like "file error" and that i should try to burn the cd at a lower speed, so i did. but the problem was still there. any idea whats wrong?

2009-06-13T02:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Oriax	 unetbootin is a tool that makes a bootable flash drive from a iso image file. i use it - and i dont have to burn cd's any more ;)
