2005-04-22T11:25:00.000Z	Xolt		What theme field usually has the definition for icon size?
2005-04-22T11:27:00.000Z	Xolt		well wait... would it be under the icon theme or the actual system theme?
2005-04-22T11:28:00.000Z	oneiFreak	Xolt	System > Preferences > File Management.  Look under Icon View Defaults, it will change it for all nautilus/file-manager views though.
