2009-04-29T09:55:00.000Z	gluonman		For some reason, when I open update-manager, it isn't showing me the upgrade to 9.04. What can I do to upgrade?
2009-04-29T09:55:00.000Z	daftykins	gluonman	try hitting alt+f2 then typing "gksudo update-manager -d"
2009-04-29T09:55:00.000Z	gluonman	daftykins	I'll give that a try.
2009-04-29T09:56:00.000Z	gluonman	daftykins	that worked. Thank you.
