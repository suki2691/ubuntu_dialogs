2005-06-17T08:38:00.000Z	fossa		i have two soundcards, one doesn'twork. everytime i start  up kde or xfce i have to restart the OSS sound server. how do i make the functioning soundcard the default?
2005-06-17T08:38:00.000Z	Selanit	fossa	can you remove the malfunctioning sound card?
2005-06-17T09:28:00.000Z	Selanit	fossa	because I'm customizing the livecd.  I need to remove several hundred MB of stuff from the LiveCD to make room for . . . other things . . . and I want to start by removing the packages that are least likely to be directly used by a newbie.
