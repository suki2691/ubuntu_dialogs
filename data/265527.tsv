2005-09-22T07:54:00.000Z	elvirolo		will it be possible, when breezy gets released, to upgrade from hoary without a hitch ? (ie: not having to run apt-get -f install, or fiddling with xorg.conf ...)
2005-09-22T07:56:00.000Z	lonewolff	elvirolo	it should work well using apt-get dist-upgrade
2005-09-22T07:56:00.000Z	lonewolff	elvirolo	i did it 2 days ago and didnt have to change anything
