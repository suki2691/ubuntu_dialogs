2005-08-28T12:39:00.000Z	tomaj	helloyo	true but m4a is a superior codec and i'd rather burn it through windows than converting it into an inferior codec
2005-08-28T12:40:00.000Z	helloyo	tomaj	yeah, i'd rather be using ogg then mp3, but its just so much more convenient to do what everyone else is sometimes
2005-08-28T12:40:00.000Z	tomaj	helloyo	so should i dump linux and use windows?
