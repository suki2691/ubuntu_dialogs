2009-06-11T07:11:00.000Z	rainwalker1		I installed ubuntu on a second hard drive in my computer, with vista on the other, and now when I boot I get grub error 21. the vista drive is set to boot first because my bios won't let me change the boot order
2009-06-11T07:12:00.000Z	altf2o	rainwalker1	if the goal is to get back into Vista, booting w/ your Vista CD (IIRC) will allow you to restore the boot sector. As far as the Grub error 21, you may be able to repair that w/ a live Ubuntu CD, perhaps someone can chime on on that.
2009-06-11T07:13:00.000Z	rainwalker1	altf2o	I want to be able to choose which OS to boot at at startup, even though they're on separate drives. I'll try using the vista disc, but I know nothing about repairing error 21 with the live cd (which I'm on now)
