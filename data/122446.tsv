2007-11-23T00:02:00.000Z	eli_		how do i make gdesklets run by default?  i know i need to add the command "gdesklets" in Sessions, but i forget what variables i should put behind the command
2007-11-23T00:02:00.000Z	eli_		*on startup
2007-11-23T00:03:00.000Z	Sopor	eli_	none, i think. I put " gdesklets" alone, and it works well
