2011-06-25T09:01:00.000Z	fweezel		I think I had a problem installing ubuntu
2011-06-25T09:01:00.000Z	fweezel		I tried to dual boot, but it ignored grub and just went straight into windows
2011-06-25T09:01:00.000Z	fweezel		I ended up installing wubi which caused the microsoft boot thing to see ubuntu, and now I think I have two installs on this computer
