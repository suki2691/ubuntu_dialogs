2008-12-21T12:08:00.000Z	\Kira		whats a good text editor that highlights certain things about programming languages? Im not really sure how to explain it. Im looking for a modern one, I think emacs is one, but I also think its pretty old.

2008-12-21T12:11:00.000Z	\Kira	qr	syntax hilighting is what I wanted :) Why would you recommend emacs, out of curiosity?
2008-12-21T12:12:00.000Z	qr	\Kira	because it has 20some odd years of work put into it by people who are very serious about their text editor
