2007-05-08T05:07:00.000Z	Vall-k		hi! (sorry for my english) i have a problem with GAMBAS. I have a file (list.txt for example) in the same directory of the gambas executable. The list.txt (and the dir) have all permisions, but if i write in gambas: file.save ("list.txt",textarea1.text) when i executing, the program show an error: "access forbidden"... Can you help me please?

2007-05-08T05:12:00.000Z	Jowi	Vall-k	I had great luck with the mailinglist actually. they are nice, helpful and concrete.
2007-05-08T05:13:00.000Z	Jowi	Vall-k	be sure to mention which version of Gambas you're using (testing or otherwise) and if you use gtk or qt, etc etc. gtk was not very mature last time i tried...
