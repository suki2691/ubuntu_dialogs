2011-10-27T03:59:00.000Z	douglas-web-dev		I migrated from Debian tonight. Then I copied lots of folders from old /home/user. I only could do this as superuser. Now all my folders belong to root. How can I make all of them, including subfolders, belong to me, a normal user?
2011-10-27T03:59:00.000Z	douglas-web-dev		Someone help me please?
