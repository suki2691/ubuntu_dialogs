2007-02-25T10:04:00.000Z	d_		i seem to be having a problem running an i386 live cd, i can get to the initial stage where it shows the screen after booting, i've made sure the cd was properly made and i can start the loading process, however when i run it, it doesnt make it to the second screen, it just stops after 1 minute or so

2007-02-25T10:06:00.000Z	h1st0	d_	basically the only thing I would suggest trying is safe graphics mode.
