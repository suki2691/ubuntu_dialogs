2006-09-04T06:31:00.000Z	Typhon	longwave	thanks.... do you know how I could get/make a Dapper install CD with a 2.6.18 kernel?
2006-09-04T06:33:00.000Z	longwave	Typhon	sorry, that's a bit advanced for me, and it seems that it isn't fixed in edgy yet, either. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Core_2_Duo_Support has lots of forum links that may provide some clues, though
