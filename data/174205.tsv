2008-06-14T04:53:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	DarkAudit	Can you not just "restart" it?
2008-06-14T04:54:00.000Z	DarkAudit	Gun_Smoke	it just updated and that was it... nothing mentioned about *anything* need... which was odd
2008-06-14T04:55:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	DarkAudit	Because there wasn't a security issue involved.  Updates would be in play as soon as you logged out.
