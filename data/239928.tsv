2009-01-29T23:45:00.000Z	Jinxed--		New to ubuntu: is there a good guide on how to install ubuntu, but keep windows on my computer.
2009-01-29T23:46:00.000Z	nickrud	Jinxed--	also http://www.ubuntupocketguide.com/index.html has that and more useful stuff
2009-01-29T23:46:00.000Z	nickrud	Jinxed--	no, you can use either 64 or 32 bit ubuntu
2009-01-29T23:47:00.000Z	nickrud	Jinxed--	dual boot means exactly that: whatever os you boot is in complete control independently of the other os
