2007-09-25T07:41:00.000Z	bigdaddy		I need to go buy a new mouse that works with ubuntu. Anyone have a recommendation?
2007-09-25T07:41:00.000Z	JeremyToo	bigdaddy	how many buttons do you need on your mouse?
2007-09-25T07:43:00.000Z	JeremyToo	bigdaddy	you may be able to program those additional buttons using xmodmap
