2011-01-21T14:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	dostokhan	yes I do too but I think he attepts to share files the don't belong to him in the dir he tries to share
2011-01-21T14:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	dostokhan	the other posibility is he tries to share files that don't belong to anyone or root since they are monted from an ntfs system they won't be changeable
