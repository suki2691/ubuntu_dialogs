2012-11-23T09:12:00.000Z	red_raven		I botched an update and a lot of things are skewed up. How do I open terminal from within nautilus? I'm just looking for its executable so I can run apt-get install Ubuntu desktop and retry the update that way.
2012-11-23T09:14:00.000Z	red_raven		Unfortunately not. Things are really screwed up. Even the graphics for the login screen were pretty.....wrong.
2012-11-23T09:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	red_raven	just press CTRL+ALT+T and you get a terminal
2012-11-23T09:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	red_raven	there is a command list in the ubuntu docs
