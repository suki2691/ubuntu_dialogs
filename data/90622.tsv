2008-07-05T17:10:00.000Z	xaustenx		is there a way to fix the problem i'm having with installing these nvidia drivers where it doesn't detect the ubuntu kernel AND can't compile the nvidia kernel?
2008-07-05T17:11:00.000Z	ubunubi	xaustenx	are you using hardy?
2008-07-05T17:12:00.000Z	ubunubi	xaustenx	use EnvyNG and be done with it, IMO
2008-07-05T17:13:00.000Z	ubunubi	xaustenx	so you're trying to install an unsupported video driver...gl with support on that :P
