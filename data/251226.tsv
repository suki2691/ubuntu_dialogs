2005-02-17T07:20:00.000Z	dueyfinster		I am running Win WP SP2 and have a Dell Dimension 8300. I try to boot from the CD I burned when I downloaded Ubuntu, but my PC keeps skipping over it and loading Windows. I have changed the boot preference order so that my CD Drive is No.1, but it makes no difference. Any Ideas?
