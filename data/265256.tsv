2005-03-23T07:10:00.000Z	az[a] zel_ubuntu	thoreauputic	yeah I just found that :) cool, I wanted to know how to turn that on in my normal distro (mandrake), but seemed to hard to setup.. but it just works in ubuntu and I never even noticed, heh
2005-03-23T07:10:00.000Z	az[a] zel_ubuntu	thoreauputic	but lets say I do want to run flat out all the time, is there a way to do that?
2005-03-23T07:26:00.000Z	az[a] zel_ubuntu	thoreauputic	yeah, which is why I've become a bit more interested in gnome
