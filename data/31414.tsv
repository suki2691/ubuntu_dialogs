2011-07-27T15:33:00.000Z	Benkinooby	hi	is there a difference in the resulting ubuntu install, when installing from CD or usb or when installing from windows(wubi)? my task: i have a friend with an elderly laptop, running windows (vista or xp - not sure) and he wants ubuntu. no i have to decide wether to go with the more "risky" cd/usb isntall or go with the safer(?) wubi install.
