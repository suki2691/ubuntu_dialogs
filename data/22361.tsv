2012-01-26T01:50:00.000Z	kieppie		hi all - I'm having a lot of trouble trying to print to a network printer shared from a Mac on my network. I've added the device vie `system-config-printer`, but I'm unable to print

2012-01-26T01:52:00.000Z	kieppie	Jordan_U	yea; I have the correct drivers & seems ok @ direct. but I'm consitering pushing it through some sort of tranlation layer - ie. ""generic printer
2012-01-26T01:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kieppie	I don't know. What happens when you try to print via the default setup (through the network)?
