2011-05-28T15:44:00.000Z	kajakajo		Can someone tell me quickly again how I can adjust window size via keyboard? My grabbable window bar is off screen so I can't drag or move it...
2011-05-28T15:45:00.000Z	Lekensteyn	kajakajo	try Alt + F3 to open a menu
2011-05-28T15:46:00.000Z	Lekensteyn	kajakajo	at least it's away :p I'm using KDE, maybe that makes the difference
2011-05-28T15:46:00.000Z	Lekensteyn	kajakajo	the next time you could try right-clicking the menu item and choose "Move"
