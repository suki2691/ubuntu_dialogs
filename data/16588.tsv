2011-03-23T19:16:00.000Z	Kruptein		hey I have pidgin and empathy installed,  and I always use pidgin, but sometime empathy just starts and logs in to my accounts disturbing my pidgin sessions and causing me to lose some messages
2011-03-23T19:17:00.000Z	Kruptein		is there any possible way to avoid this without removing empathy from my system?
2011-03-23T19:18:00.000Z	kerneloops_	Kruptein	I have a theory: if I dont use a program I remove it :p
2011-03-23T19:19:00.000Z	Kruptein	kerneloops_	 I also have that theory :D except that It already occured twice that pidgin wasn't able to connect when empathy was ;)
