2011-12-07T04:20:00.000Z	erebel55		I'm really just trying to install a clean version of windows 7...but when I tried the windows install it also stopped at the beginning, so I was just trying to install ubuntu, and then overwrite ubuntu with windows 7
2011-12-07T04:21:00.000Z	ArveT	erebel55	tried wubi?
2011-12-07T04:22:00.000Z	erebel55	ArveT	well the reason I want to do a clean install of windows 7, is that my current one will not boot, it is very virused
2011-12-07T04:24:00.000Z	ArveT	erebel55	sorry misunderstood, my situation was that I have win7 running and installed ubuntu through wubi
