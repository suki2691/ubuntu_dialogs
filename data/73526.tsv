2008-12-04T05:20:00.000Z	RedWar		Can anyone comment on how Ibex is working out, I d hate to upgrade, since it requires that I reinstall some of my faves, Like Kiba Dock and others.
2008-12-04T05:21:00.000Z	mezquitale	RedWar	 ibex is not so bad, wireless on my old T23 laptop is not working as it used to, though, I can't connect wirelessly at home
2008-12-04T05:22:00.000Z	RedWar	mezquitale	Is there a workaround for that?
2008-12-04T05:23:00.000Z	mezquitale	RedWar	 there's probably a way around to that, I haven't got the time to try it, it works fine on the library though other than that, I don't have any complaints, firefox looks different,  it looks a little better for me, not bad
