2006-04-11T11:09:00.000Z	BobC2		Hi, A new Linux (Ubuntu) user of about a week now.
2006-04-11T11:11:00.000Z	BobC2		I've seen that Ubuntu can read and write to a floppy disk the was formatted in WindowsXP and I was a bit surprised.   Is this because they can both read/write to FAT 16 ( I think that's what a floppy is)?
