2009-08-11T07:55:00.000Z	Ashfire908		Hi, when I run Nexuiz and start a match, at the end of loading, my system "breaks". I can't do anything. If i try to switch ttys nothing on screen happens, ctrl-atl-delete does nothing useful, and the only way I can fix it is by restarting with the power button (hodling it) or SysRq keys.
