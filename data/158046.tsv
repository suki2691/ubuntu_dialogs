2009-05-08T20:14:00.000Z	Blodskur		I've just installed Ubuntu 64bit, is there a list of recommended software I should install?
2009-05-08T20:14:00.000Z	Slart	Blodskur	most of the recommended software is already installed by default
2009-05-08T20:15:00.000Z	Slart	Blodskur	speaking for myself.. I usually end up installing adobes flash and java.. not sure if there is anything I'd called essential
