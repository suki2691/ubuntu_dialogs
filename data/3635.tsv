2012-04-28T16:38:00.000Z	BluesKaj	solstice_	did you run the dropbox installer?
2012-04-28T16:40:00.000Z	solstice_	BluesKaj	 yes. not the ubuntu one, the official dropbo one. It then downloads and installs the daemon in ~/dropbox-dist. It's just invoking dropbox start -i
2012-04-28T16:41:00.000Z	solstice_		may 12.04 is not yet supoprted on dropbox site. that's why
2012-04-28T16:42:00.000Z	BluesKaj	solstice_	dropboxd should run at startup ..not sure where that setting is on ubuntu tho , since i'm on kde
