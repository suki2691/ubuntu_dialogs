2006-09-22T08:19:00.000Z	dren		Hello. I just installed Ubuntu (6.06) and I created the user and pass of "root" and "root" (both the same) and now I can't log into ubuntu when it starts up. What do I do?
2006-09-22T08:20:00.000Z	dren		"root" (no quotes)
2006-09-22T08:20:00.000Z	dren		lmfao, serious?
2006-09-22T08:20:00.000Z	myatthu	dren	root account is disabled by default on ubuntu ... and for the record pls pls pls never create an account called root on any linux distros when you are installing
