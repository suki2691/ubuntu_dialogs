2007-04-24T15:41:00.000Z	_XeN_	kditty	why would you wanna do all that upgrading? why not just do a fresh install?
2007-04-24T15:43:00.000Z	kditty	_XeN_	id like to keep my settings and programs, ive backed some up but im worried that ill lose data like i always do after a fresh install, something i forgot to back up like always :x
2007-04-24T15:45:00.000Z	kditty	_XeN_	are all my settings in my home dir? bookmarks and program settings etc?
