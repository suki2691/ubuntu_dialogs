2010-01-14T13:25:00.000Z	llutz	max1234	usually sourcecode comes with readme-files or INSTALL
2010-01-14T13:27:00.000Z	max1234	llutz	yea I saw the readme but don't know what to do with it, the site says install it: tar xavf transset-df-6 tar.gz, cd transset-df-6, make, sudo checkinstall
2010-01-14T13:28:00.000Z	llutz	max1234	what do you think, one should do with a file called "read.me"?
