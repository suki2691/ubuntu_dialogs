2010-12-25T21:10:00.000Z	lotus		hey, I just paired my bluetooth headset with my netbook and I'm trying to figure out how to get the audio to route over to the headset.  Any ideas?

2010-12-25T21:11:00.000Z	SwedeMike	lotus	system->preferences->sound
2010-12-25T21:15:00.000Z	lotus	SwedeMike	I'm actually running crunchbang, what's the name of that GUI tool so that I may invoke it via commandline?
