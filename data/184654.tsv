2006-05-27T06:11:00.000Z	Haydre		Just wondering, I'm currently running breezy, is it possible to use the dapper repositories in breezy? Or will this create dependency issues
2006-05-27T06:13:00.000Z	sam_	Haydre	It's possible, but probably a bad idea.
2006-05-27T06:15:00.000Z	sam_	Haydre	I did apt-pinning back in the pre-Hoary days. It worked but not nearly as smoothly as I was acostomed to.
2006-05-27T06:17:00.000Z	Haydre	sam_	Ok, thanks, that was what I was wondering
