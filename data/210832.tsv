And you need a lot of time to figure out pxe boot service from ubuntu. With knoppix it is point-and-drool - ever tried the terminal server there for pxe boot? It doesn't seem to be available yet for ubuntu. Precisely because of the different focus.
2006-02-27T14:37:00.000Z	peej	Bergcube	: I am NOT discarding it at all. I inflict it on most people. But I am aware of what is the right tool for the job.
2006-02-27T14:39:00.000Z	peej	Bergcube	: ubuntu is not designed for rescue or autoconfig, though it does a good job and has strengths that knoppix cannot match. That's why I frogmarch people into ubuntu rather than debian or knoppix. ubuntu is the One True Way (except for when it isn't, if you see what I mean).
2006-02-27T14:46:00.000Z	peej	Bergcube	: no, you have the hacker mentality. You are like me. I don't care to juggle disks. But the very force of evolution splits linux into various distros/ways to do things which have their strengths. I've stuck with debian as my personal use distro. Knoppix for rescue. Ubuntu for others, and for supporting (though it can be debian too actually).
