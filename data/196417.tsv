2006-03-07T10:54:00.000Z	digital-ninja		do you know where i could find that info likein the wiki or smthing?
2006-03-07T10:54:00.000Z	dr_Willis	digital-ninja	 a read of 'using samba'  book avial online. will give ya all kinds of info
2006-03-07T10:55:00.000Z	dr_Willis	digital-ninja	 also you could just use 'ssh' and 'winscp' on the windows box's - it seems to be a little easier to setup. :P well trivial even..
