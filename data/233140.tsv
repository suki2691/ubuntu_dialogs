2008-06-08T01:14:00.000Z	rmflagg		I am trying to use Audacious' audtool via crontab, but I keep getting a DBus error.  Anyone have a clue as to why this is happening?
2008-06-08T01:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	rmflagg	well running graphical apps via cron is not a good idea ...
2008-06-08T01:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	rmflagg	ahh ok i thought you said audacious
2008-06-08T01:20:00.000Z	rmflagg	erUSUL	audtool is part of the audacious package.  I should have specified!
