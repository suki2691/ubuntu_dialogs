2009-06-09T20:10:00.000Z	bieb	gartral	AceKing:  yeah I want to create a menu of apps for the school I work for, I am in the process of setting up and testing LTSP for one of our labs, there are currently a bunch of shortcuts on the win machines there, I figured if I can create a custom menu with all the shortcuts in it,  it would be nicer.
