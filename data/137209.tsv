2007-04-23T16:48:00.000Z	lefinx		anyone tried to install beryl on an ubuntu feisty desktop with an ATI radeon graphic card?
2007-04-23T16:48:00.000Z	mwe	lefinx	no, but I heard it wont work in Feisty
2007-04-23T16:49:00.000Z	lefinx	mwe	what about compiz?
2007-04-23T16:49:00.000Z	mwe	lefinx	I *think* it should work. try #ubuntu-effects for better advice, though.
