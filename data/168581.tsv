2009-03-18T16:19:00.000Z	scunizi	Fizix	most tablets use a wacom setup.. have you tried to google your model number and "ubuntu" at the end of the search string?  you can't be the only one that's tried this.

Just make a backup of xorg before hand with (sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup)
