2011-07-06T05:41:00.000Z	EmuAlert		Can I fairly safely replace one Ubuntu installation with another?
2011-07-06T05:42:00.000Z	gohdan	EmuAlert	and replace in what manner?
2011-07-06T05:43:00.000Z	EmuAlert	KM0201	As in, wipe the current Ubuntu installation and replace it entirely, while keeping the same parition size and not screwing up my other partitions
