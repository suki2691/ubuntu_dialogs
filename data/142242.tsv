2007-07-06T05:17:00.000Z	anon2000		hi, i currently have my pc as dual-boot with Vista and Ubuntu, using the GRUB bootloader. i am thinking about installing XP and triple-booting but I'm not sure how I'd go about fixing GRUB after installing XP. I'm assuming that the XP install will destroy GRUB and I will somehow have to restore it. How would I do this?
