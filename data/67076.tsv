2010-11-04T22:00:00.000Z	PhantomString		Question for anyone: Fresh install of 10.10, wireless is running fine.  After messing with the display manager, wireless doesn't work.  I mean, kernel modules are loaded but it acts as if the device is off
2010-11-04T22:02:00.000Z	lock	PhantomString	I had the same issue with 10.10, I found no solution in the needed amount of time so i reverted to 10.4 LTS
2010-11-04T22:02:00.000Z	lock	PhantomString	*10.04
2010-11-04T22:46:00.000Z	lock	PhantomString	did you ever get a response on your wireless device issue?
