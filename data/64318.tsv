2011-02-27T07:34:00.000Z	geek0292		anyone know an answer to my update problem? I HAVE done some digging, and found that some routers refer to the internal DHCP as the router's internal IP, which I've found to be true in this router through resolv.conf
2011-02-27T07:34:00.000Z	geek0292		who, me?
2011-02-27T07:35:00.000Z	geek0292		so, can I please get some help with this? I know you're all doing this on your own time, so no pressure.
