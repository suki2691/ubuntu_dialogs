2008-03-31T18:28:00.000Z	Mzalendo	Creationist	i have already followed steps suggested under Ubuntu LAMP.... i have phpmyadmin running at the moment... so it means apache2 server and mysql5 are correctly installed...
2008-03-31T18:29:00.000Z	Mzalendo	Creationist	my main problem is to get the Joomla installation console running from the browser, which is the easiest way to install it
2008-03-31T18:30:00.000Z	Creationist	Mzalendo	I don't know anything about servers... I just know that LAMP is what you were asking about ;)  Sorry.
