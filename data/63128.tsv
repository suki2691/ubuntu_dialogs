2009-03-18T15:24:00.000Z	JosefAssad		here's a fun question: I'm looking for suggestions for open source infrastructure (no desktop apps) which can be deployed as non-intrusive pilots for a large public institution (meaning, they don't replace or intrude upon any of the existing Microsoft systems). Suggestions?
2009-03-18T15:25:00.000Z	cvctor	JosefAssad	how about Cygwin?

2009-03-18T15:27:00.000Z	cvctor	JosefAssad	I'm googling for Alfresco right now
