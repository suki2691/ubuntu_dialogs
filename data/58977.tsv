2009-04-27T20:07:00.000Z	klgtre		I have my harddisk encrypted via cryptsetup. My home folder in on an extra partition and mounted to /dev/mapper/home. After the update to Jaunty, I am asked to enter the passphrase for all partitions (expected swap, thats normal) but when I try to log in, GNOME tells me, it can't find my home folder at /home/klgtre. I can't log in!
