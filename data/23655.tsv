2010-10-23T00:55:00.000Z	mattt-netbook	alkemann	as in it removed non-php* packages?
2010-10-23T00:55:00.000Z	alkemann	mattt-netbook	openoffice, pidgin, all sorts of stuff in the list
2010-10-23T00:59:00.000Z	mattt-netbook	alkemann	i think you should have a log of what was removed in /var/log/dpkg.log, btw.
