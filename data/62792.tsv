2009-08-01T00:23:00.000Z	Onca		Could someone demystify, why my newly compiled vanilla kernel conflicts with gnome's HAL service? Though the keyboard and mouse work fine in a terminal, when X starts I don't have any mouse or keyboard and I get a "Failed to initialize hal" Did I omit something important in my kernel?
2009-08-01T00:25:00.000Z	guntbert	Onca	as far as I know self compiled kernels are not supported here
2009-08-01T00:25:00.000Z	Onca	guntbert	Ic, but can I remove hal somehow?
2009-08-01T00:26:00.000Z	guntbert	Onca	I don't think so (at the moment, as sebsebseb pointed out)
