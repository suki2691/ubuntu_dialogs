2007-02-10T17:14:00.000Z	arn_		i have a "*.ttf" font. can anyone tell me where should i put that? i cant read my native language site for that
2007-02-10T17:15:00.000Z	bruenig	arn_	/usr/share/fonts
2007-02-10T17:15:00.000Z	bruenig	arn_	there may be some more navigation from /usr/share/fonts depending on  your setup but that is where the fonts are housed
2007-02-10T17:21:00.000Z	arn_	bruenig	i found lotz of folders inside "/usr/share/fonts" folder, where should i put my font so that firefox can use it?
