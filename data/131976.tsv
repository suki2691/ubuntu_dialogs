2008-06-26T06:29:00.000Z	K^Holtz		why does my firefox stop loading after so many times that it opens and closes?
2008-06-26T06:29:00.000Z	RAdams	K^Holtz	run it in terminal and see if it outputs anything
2008-06-26T06:29:00.000Z	K^Holtz		my firefox will say Starting Firefox, but then it will never actually load up. Its been working find the last few hours tho
2008-06-26T06:30:00.000Z	K^Holtz	RAdams	my Terminal is open, but i dont see any prompt
