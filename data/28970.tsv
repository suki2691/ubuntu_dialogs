2010-09-11T07:20:00.000Z	sixtwo		I was wondering if anyone can help me?
2010-09-11T07:22:00.000Z	sixtwo		Just built new 64 bit quad core and installed 64 bit Ubuntu 10.4 - but system is running slower than my P4. Any suggestions? I have a WD Caviar Green HD, 1GB PC26400 mem, Phenom 9850 CPU and a 1GB Nvidia 220 GT video card (not installed).
2010-09-11T07:23:00.000Z	sixtwo		for the time being - but just running ubuntu is slow - my p4 with 2gb performs better than it
