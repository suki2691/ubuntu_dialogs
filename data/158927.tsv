2006-11-18T13:42:00.000Z	bingnet922	bjv	yes, I've been using the last week.
2006-11-18T13:44:00.000Z	bjv	bingnet922	well, then id sort of have to ask: what did you change? install any new packages, etc. before you shut it down?
2006-11-18T13:51:00.000Z	bingnet922	bjv	not that I know of, I did change fstab to change mount points. root partition is not full, and the new mount points are not working for some reason. see output from ken@liteshow$startx > http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32484/
