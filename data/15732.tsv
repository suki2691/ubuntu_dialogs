2011-04-18T01:31:00.000Z	zerd_		Hi,  I'm trying to mount an ext3-formatted usb drive which I usually serve through samba. When I mount it directly to my laptop the special characters (umlauts) in filenames become question marks and the kde complains it can't find the file (although it is there). Anyone know how to resolve this issue?
