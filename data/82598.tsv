2010-06-13T00:30:00.000Z	xZillerationer		I have a question.
2010-06-13T00:31:00.000Z	xZillerationer		I can't make the desktop cube in Compiz work, I've tried everything it says online. It shows up as a flat strip.
2010-06-13T00:33:00.000Z	guntbert	xZillerationer	can you give me 1 link that you tried? (just out of curiosity, I can offer no help)
