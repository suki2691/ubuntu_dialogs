2008-08-07T11:13:00.000Z	maozhang		i'm having trouble using ubuntu to connect to my wireless network. The network name is correct: 'wireless' , Password type: WPA2 Personal, and the password I put is correct too
2008-08-07T11:13:00.000Z	maozhang		everytime i exit the setttings, and go back in, the password type changes from WPA2 personal to WPA personal
