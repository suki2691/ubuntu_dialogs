2005-07-23T15:11:00.000Z	loply		a few weeks ago both of my Hoary Hedgehog desktops stopped booting, telling me "pivot_root: no such file or directory \n /sbin/init: 428: cannot open dev/console: no such file"... is this a known issue?
2005-07-23T15:12:00.000Z	loply		this is with all ubuntu kernels including recovery mode
