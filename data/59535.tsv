2009-10-09T12:29:00.000Z	tehbaut		I have four hard drives but have no idea where grub's MBR was installed
2009-10-09T12:30:00.000Z	tehbaut		is the default grub mbr: \NST\nst_grub.mbr ?
2009-10-09T12:30:00.000Z	tehbaut		if not, maybe that's my problem
2009-10-09T12:31:00.000Z	cybersplice	tehbaut	the MBR isn't a file, i guess that might be a backup, or a suspend thinger.
