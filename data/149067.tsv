2008-08-31T05:17:00.000Z	buahhaha		I've tried to modify a playlist to a script that would copy those mp3s to a particular location and if the filenames are as "/my/mp3/collection/path/Some Artist - Some Song.mp3" /the/location/I/want/the/copies
2008-08-31T05:17:00.000Z	buahhaha		the result is a file called "?" there
2008-08-31T05:18:00.000Z	buahhaha		so why is it possible to use cp from the command line and give the filename (since it has spaces) in quotation marks but not in a script - those seem to require an escape character instead
