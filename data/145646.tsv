2009-12-13T23:04:00.000Z	Ballsy		Hi gang.  Trying to install 9.10 on amd Athlon 64 arch, and have had 0 success.  md5sum checks out on the downloaded images (tried alternate disks too), used 'verify' option when burning with Nero and ImgBurn, tried using 2 diff burners on 2 diff PCs....install kaks with scrolling errors (cannot read from cache file, something about SQUASHFS, etc etc)
2009-12-13T23:05:00.000Z	Flare183	Ballsy	Try the USB Install.
