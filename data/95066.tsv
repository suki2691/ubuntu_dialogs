2008-06-23T02:50:00.000Z	v0idnull		hello folks, I have a question. I have three harddrives in my pc, and all are the same make/model. I want to ensure that when I install ubuntu, I'm using the harddrive in the SATA 1 port. Is it safe to that's device 0,0,0?

2008-06-23T02:51:00.000Z	v0idnull	dmsuperman	how do I determine it then?
2008-06-23T02:51:00.000Z	dmsuperman	v0idnull	to be absolutely sure, i'd unplug the others and install to the only remaining one
