2008-06-15T02:21:00.000Z	aceinthehole	coopster	what did you say you were doing wit gnome?
2008-06-15T02:22:00.000Z	aceinthehole	coopster	yeah the .gnome2 directory saves your sessions and preferences, so renaming it would do that. Have you put everything back to default by erasing .gnome .gnome2 .metacity .gconf and .gconfd ?
2008-06-15T02:23:00.000Z	coopster	aceinthehole	well, I'm not sure I really want everything back to default, I just want gnome-panel gone.  I've made changes in gconf that I'd like to keep.
