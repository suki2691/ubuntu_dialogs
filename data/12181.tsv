2012-04-18T00:26:00.000Z	ejo		Hi all, I'd really like to fresh-install 12.04 beta right now.  My one concern is: when release comes out soon will I be in a worse position than if I just waited for release in the first place?  Will upgrading be messy?
2012-04-18T00:27:00.000Z	ejo		Or is there any other reason to hold back?
2012-04-18T00:27:00.000Z	ejo		thanks zyk
