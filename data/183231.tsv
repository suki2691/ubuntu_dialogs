2007-10-22T04:50:00.000Z	snes_rocks		My laptop's hotkeys decided they don't want to do anything anymore
2007-10-22T04:50:00.000Z	snes_rocks		Is there anyway to stop their rebellion?
2007-10-22T04:51:00.000Z	Pelo	snes_rocks	did you need to configure them before they worked the firt time ? do it again
