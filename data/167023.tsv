2006-10-15T08:13:00.000Z	rummik		at one point i was able to get a screen rez of 1024x768, when i used a different dist, why do i get a rez of 640x480 here?
2006-10-15T08:15:00.000Z	ArrenLex	rummik	'cause it's not set up properly?
2006-10-15T08:15:00.000Z	rummik	ArrenLex	yeah, i figured that one out :P
2006-10-15T08:17:00.000Z	rummik	ArrenLex	seriously though, i altered my xorg.conf and changed it so 640x480 wasn't in the config for a possible screen rez, but i still get this rez...
