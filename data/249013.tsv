2005-03-07T14:17:00.000Z	Vilijo		if I wand to install windows apps and games, I need to install VMware or Qemu? VMware being commercial and Qemu being slow and non-compatible with some software and not easy to install?

2005-03-07T14:19:00.000Z	Vilijo		Amaranth is qemu hard to install? how much do I need to read manuals and how much I can go on with on-screen guide?
