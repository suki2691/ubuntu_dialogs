2008-04-17T02:22:00.000Z	Totem		I would like to take space away from my Windows partition and add it to my Ubuntu partition. I have GParted, but the Windows partition is locked. How should I do this?

2008-04-17T02:24:00.000Z	Totem	sachael	How should I unmount it. Using the unmount option?
2008-04-17T02:24:00.000Z	sachael	Totem	better listen to Orbixx :)
