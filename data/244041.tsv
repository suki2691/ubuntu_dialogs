2006-12-20T11:13:00.000Z	fuoco	Imrahil	how would a link help me ?
2006-12-20T11:15:00.000Z	Imrahil	fuoco	correct me if I am wrong: you wish to create a file (perhaps using the dd method stefg listed) then you wish to access it from another part of the file system?
2006-12-20T11:16:00.000Z	fuoco	Imrahil	not exactly. I want to use that file to temporarily overcome disk space shortage in a specific partition/directory
