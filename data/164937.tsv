2008-07-02T08:06:00.000Z	neil_d		I have exim4 installed,  how do I change what user the root emails get sent to ?
2008-07-02T08:07:00.000Z	|rt|	neil_d	you can do that with /etc/aliases
2008-07-02T08:08:00.000Z	|rt|	neil_d	by default ubuntu sets this to the first account created during the install process
