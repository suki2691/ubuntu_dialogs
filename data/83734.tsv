2009-11-20T09:41:00.000Z	Tartaros		the gFTP application tells me "The protocol 'FTP' is currently not supported." how wrong is that?!
2009-11-20T09:41:00.000Z	Tartaros		what other protocol should it support than the one in it's name...
2009-11-20T09:41:00.000Z	lstarnes	Tartaros	what about ftp in lowercase?
2009-11-20T09:43:00.000Z	Tartaros	lstarnes	heh, looks like that was it. still, it's uppercase in the name too :)
