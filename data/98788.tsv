2008-05-22T18:49:00.000Z	SealedWithAKIss		I am having trouble installing Limewire onto Ubuntu Gutsy. I downloaded the rpm and used the command rpm -i filename which told me that I hjad to use alien to install it on a Debian based system. So I did sudo apt-get install alien and then issues=d alien -i filename and it has given me an error and created another folder.
