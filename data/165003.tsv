2009-05-03T07:24:00.000Z	Zoffix		Am I really the only weirdo who wants to install all the games that noone implemented a "Select all" option? :S
2009-05-03T07:24:00.000Z	Ademan	Zoffix	I think so :-p
2009-05-03T07:24:00.000Z	Zoffix	Ademan	I'd at least expect the "SHIFT+arrows" to be implemented :|
2009-05-03T07:25:00.000Z	Ademan	Zoffix	although with straight apt-get or aptitude you might be able to install whole sections
