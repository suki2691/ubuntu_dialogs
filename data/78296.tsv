2009-10-13T11:20:00.000Z	maestrojed		I would like to change a user's home directory. When I look at that users current home directory it is filled with files (I guess system files, I did not put them there). If I change the user's home directory do those files need to be there? Will they be recreated in the new folder?

2009-10-13T11:22:00.000Z	maestrojed	Docteh	help? as in performance or as in they are nice to have. Because I will let /home/username exist so they will be available. I just will change the "active" user's directory
