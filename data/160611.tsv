2012-06-02T06:42:00.000Z	deepspeed		I have a corrupted 4 gig micro sd in an sd adapter plugged into an sd port.
2012-06-02T06:42:00.000Z	deepspeed		I'm running a lucid distro with enlightenment, and can't seem to recognize the disk.
2012-06-02T06:42:00.000Z	deepspeed		Is there a tool I can use to help me recover the thing?
