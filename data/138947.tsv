2007-09-08T16:39:00.000Z	tinin		Hi,, How do I make an application to autostart each time I log in?
2007-09-08T16:39:00.000Z	Xyhthyx	tinin	put a .desktop for it in /etc/xdg/autostart
2007-09-08T16:40:00.000Z	Xyhthyx	tinin	or add it in system->pref>sessions
2007-09-08T16:42:00.000Z	tinin	Xyhthyx	neol, I use kde most of the times, but now in gnome I don't seem to have system->pref>sessions, did I miss something to install?
