2009-03-22T16:24:00.000Z	jrib	tuxFan	what do you want it to do?
2009-03-22T16:24:00.000Z	jrib	tuxFan	system -> administration -> system monitor.  But it's probably easier to just run « xkill » and then click on the offending program
2009-03-22T16:25:00.000Z	jrib	tuxFan	then just use the first method I gave you
