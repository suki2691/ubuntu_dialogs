2010-07-12T05:38:00.000Z	edbian	kmudrick	They work just like any other module.  They're restricted simply because they're proprietary.  It's just a name, not really a description of the module.
2010-07-12T05:39:00.000Z	kmudrick	edbian	here's the problem. i built a new custom kernel, with patches to make my trackpad work. but now, my wireless no longer works, and the docs that tell you how to build restricted modules, is not applicable to 10.04
2010-07-12T05:40:00.000Z	edbian	kmudrick	That I am not able to help you with!  I've never built a kernel module.  I'm impressed by your ability to build a custom kernel :)
