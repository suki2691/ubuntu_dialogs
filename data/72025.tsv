2010-06-07T12:26:00.000Z	kurrata		i have 1 rss reader(liferea) but for some reason for some feeds it shows full text for others 1 or 2 lines only. Is there something wrong on my end or thats some server configuration?
2010-06-07T12:26:00.000Z	lasse	kurrata	tried a different rss reader ?
2010-06-07T12:35:00.000Z	kurrata	lasse	yes, in other rss reader only 1 line to for some feeds(installed rssowl to check)
2010-06-07T12:35:00.000Z	lasse	kurrata	most likely server side then ;) Try another feed to make sure but it looks like you found the problem....
