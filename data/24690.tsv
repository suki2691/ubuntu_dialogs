2010-10-12T19:14:00.000Z	Jonathan_L		I'm having issue here. Gparted will not let me resize my partitions from this live CD (Ubuntu 10.10)
2010-10-12T19:15:00.000Z	Jonathan_L		How can I unmount the Windows partition so that I can resize it!?
2010-10-12T19:16:00.000Z	Jonathan_L		I want to do this in GParted, because AFAIK the installer don't have those kind of advanced features I need
