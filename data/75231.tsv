2008-11-26T17:53:00.000Z	SOURdiesel		i have 2 issues i can't figure out on Hardy.  first, ecerytime i reboot my timezone changes to Asia/Rangoon.  i set it to America/NewYork which is the closest. and now the weather icon is a grey cube(happened this morning).  second, the display sleep only works some of the time.  anyone have any suggestions?
