2009-05-06T10:28:00.000Z	boringpackets		what the heck did i do to my hard drive?
2009-05-06T10:29:00.000Z	khensthoth	boringpackets	Try to use gparted to visualise it?
2009-05-06T10:29:00.000Z	boringpackets	khensthoth	it was gparted that shows that the drive is physically smaller, the ntfs partition i resized did indeed shrink, but there's no free space to show for it
