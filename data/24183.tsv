2011-12-03T12:39:00.000Z	MeirD		Hello, Is there a way I can set up VPN without static IP address?
2011-12-03T12:41:00.000Z	KM0201	MeirD	it'd be pretty difficult.. can you assign IP addresses via your router? (that's how i usually assign them)
2011-12-03T12:41:00.000Z	KM0201	MeirD	do you have a router?
2011-12-03T12:42:00.000Z	KM0201	MeirD	oh wait, nevermind, i'm sorry.. i'm totally spacing it right now..
