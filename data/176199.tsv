2006-06-29T14:06:00.000Z	WarOfAttrition		no boot issues for me, just installation issues
2006-06-29T14:06:00.000Z	WarOfAttrition		the ubuntu system requisites states "128MB": false, not with the live cd
2006-06-29T14:07:00.000Z	WarOfAttrition		not even 256MB RAM is enough to install on the live cd
2006-06-29T14:08:00.000Z	thun___	WarOfAttrition	then why is the alternate cd only for machines with less that 192mb of ram?
