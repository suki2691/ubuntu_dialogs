2009-12-06T18:37:00.000Z	ManDay		Helo! I just removed GDM and now when I boot up my computer I'm dropped into some very weird screen which looks like my monitor is broken and I can no absolutly NOTHING! I can find no way to do anything! What can I do?
2009-12-06T18:37:00.000Z	portn0k	ManDay	you have no terminal?
2009-12-06T18:38:00.000Z	portn0k	ManDay	hit escape on boot to bring up the grup menu, boot into single user mode, and apt-get install gdm <-- my reccomendation
2009-12-06T18:40:00.000Z	ManDay	portn0k	I can't get into grub. i keep hitting esc like a lunatic but grub just skips me.
