I tried Kanotix, Ubuntu, and Kubuntu and nothing's working properly; they either display a blank screen or the graphical part of the splash screen, but the scrolling text NEVER shows up.

2007-07-31T07:54:00.000Z	Kuprin	bulmer	Can't do low rez, monitor only runs at 1280x1024
2007-07-31T07:54:00.000Z	bulmer	Kuprin	then perhaps during boot from cd...select the higher rez
