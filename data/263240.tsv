2004-10-14T16:01:00.000Z	Drew		I have a question, has anyone else had a problem with the installer sitting at 36% under "Installing Ubuntu Base System" while "Installing Core Packages", I have had it sit like that for about 10 minutes before rebooting and trying agin, to no avail...
2004-10-14T16:03:00.000Z	Drew		it ran fine in a VMWare virtual machine, but now that I try and install it on a secondary hard drive for dual boot it always hangs up at 36%
2004-10-14T16:05:00.000Z	Qua	Drew	yup another console, "vmstat 1", "ifconfig" twice in a row, packet count changes?
