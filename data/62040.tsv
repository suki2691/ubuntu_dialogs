2012-01-18T23:00:00.000Z	iElectric		is there any way to instal python2.4 on oneiric?
2012-01-18T23:01:00.000Z	Pici	iElectric	There is no python2.4 package in the repos. Is there a reason that you can't use 2.7 (or 2.6 or 2.5)?
2012-01-18T23:05:00.000Z	Pici	iElectric	Again, is there a reason you can't use the current version of python?
2012-01-18T23:06:00.000Z	iElectric	Pici	I have a very good reason and would do anything to switch for 2.7
