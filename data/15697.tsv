2012-01-28T08:55:00.000Z	pnorman		I tried ssh -f -L 1234:blip:1234 pnorman@hyper -N and connecting to hyper on port 1234, but it didn't work and I'm trying to figure out where it failed

2012-01-28T08:57:00.000Z	pnorman	hydrox24	Ya, it's installed
2012-02-01T13:10:00.000Z	hydrox24	pnorman	you're right.
