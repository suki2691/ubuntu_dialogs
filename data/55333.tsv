2010-06-01T05:02:00.000Z	Taulus		He he! So I should reinstall 9.10 on my desktop also :)
2010-06-01T05:03:00.000Z	edbian	Taulus	I suggest upgrading.  Although I'm not running 10.04 currently I have used it.
2010-06-01T05:04:00.000Z	edbian	Taulus	It is a step forward.  Compared to other releases 1 month after release 10.04 has very few bugs.
