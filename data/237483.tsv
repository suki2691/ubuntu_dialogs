2008-11-19T14:03:00.000Z	ChrisW	Kira	if you want a domain controller, run samba
2008-11-19T14:05:00.000Z	Kira	ChrisW	If I understand correctly, Samba pretty much ports the Windows domain controller protocol to Linux. But other than Samba, does Linux usually have its own equivalent/parallel of the Windows domain controller?
2008-11-19T14:07:00.000Z	ChrisW	Kira	depends what you want to do...
