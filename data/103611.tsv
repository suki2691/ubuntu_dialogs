2011-04-26T07:13:00.000Z	groovyD		I can't get my synaptic touchpad to work correctly on my laptop.  Running Mint 10, based on Ubuntu 10.10. Right click doesn't work, and touchpad stays activated when typing, even though I have it set in the Gnome configuration GUI settings to deactivate when typing. Any suggestions?
