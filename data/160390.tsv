But my problem is with the firmware loading, when i try modprobe acx in dmesg aoutput says: [  216.632000]  requesting firmware image 'tiacx111cFF' [  216.744000]  acx: firmware image 'tiacx111cFF' was not provided. Check your hotplug scripts [  216.744000]  requesting firmware image 'tiacx111' [  216.748000]  acx

2007-08-14T11:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lokkilololo	Are you sure that the firmware is included in linux-restricted-modules?
