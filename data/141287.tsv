Though one thing I am finding is difficult is how I can "hack" some of my existing apps without royally screwing things up.  In gentoo this was fairly easy as you could have a portage "overlay" and store your "hacked" packages in there. If wanted to apply a patch to, say, a core gnome application, what is the safest way to do so?
2007-09-22T06:51:00.000Z	wastrel	monkeyBox	 download the source package
2007-09-22T06:51:00.000Z	wastrel	monkeyBox	 build and checkinstall that, then install it
2007-09-22T06:51:00.000Z	monkeyBox	wastrel	and if a source package doesn't exist?
