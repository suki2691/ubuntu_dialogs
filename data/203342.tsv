2005-12-24T14:44:00.000Z	Killer_Smurf		Ok.   I have issues.  I was asking about adding memory to a laptop.  Everyone has said that I could just add it but when I do my lappy won't boot.  I was told everything from the memory is bad to I didn't install it right.  I was also told that this was not an ubuntu or linux issue.  So I tried adding the mem and booting from a live cd.  No problems which means that it is an issue with ubuntu.  It must have something to do with
