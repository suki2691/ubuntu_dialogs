2007-04-02T10:14:00.000Z	guillem101		I'm installing ubuntu feisty at my sister's laptop. I've reserved a partition where she may install XP (if I cannot avoid it). When XP be installed, MBR will be overwritten by XP. How can I restore grub afterwards?
2007-04-02T10:15:00.000Z	WindowsUser	guillem101	make a copy of it? install xp first?
2007-04-02T10:15:00.000Z	guillem101	WindowsUser	nope, XP is optional- perhaps it is not even installed
2007-04-02T10:16:00.000Z	WindowsUser	guillem101	then save a copy of the mbr, or do the boot live cd, grub-install thing
