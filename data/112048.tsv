2009-06-20T20:43:00.000Z	bill-e1		I'm trying to exclude a number of partitions from displaying on the right panel.  A search revealed that creating a file named volume_exclude_list which included the volume UID's and putting it in the /apps/netbook-launcher/ directory would exclude these partitions.
2009-06-20T20:43:00.000Z	bill-e1		My 9.04 ubuntu install does not have an /apps/netbook-launcher directory so I created it in a number of places but to no avail.  When I start netbook-launcher from a terminal window I can see that the volumes are loading.
2009-06-20T20:43:00.000Z	bill-e1		Where should the volume_exclude_list file go exactly?  thanks.
