2008-03-30T16:58:00.000Z	Hewus	ompaul	I thought about doing something like that, but I'm not that experienced with scripts. However the way you mention it, it sounds doable... I figured there would be something around already though, similar to DUmeter and NetLimiter for windows

2008-03-30T16:59:00.000Z	ompaul	Hewus	and variants of same
