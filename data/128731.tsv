2007-09-29T07:20:00.000Z	I`ll_Begin		Hey. I have a question
2007-09-29T07:20:00.000Z	I`ll_Begin		I'm temporarily using Ubuntu because I'm having computer problems, and I found that I haven't got any permission to do anything.
2007-09-29T07:21:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	I`ll_Begin	what kind of things do you need permission to do?
