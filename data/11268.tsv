2011-07-30T17:17:00.000Z	oCean	pinkprincess	it's a matter of personal taste, mostly. However this channel is for ubuntu specific support. The #ubuntu-offtopic channel is better suited for general discussion
2011-07-30T17:21:00.000Z	oCean	pinkprincess	please move that discussion to #ubuntu-offtopic
2011-07-30T17:23:00.000Z	pinkprincess	oCean	it was just for a short discussion (its done now) sorry, but I did not want to waste time switching channels
2011-07-30T17:23:00.000Z	pinkprincess	oCean	so this a support channel ... might need help once I enter the linux world?
