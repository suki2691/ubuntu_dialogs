2006-03-09T11:21:00.000Z	bthornton		I'm guessing not, since the ATI driver doesn't say anything of support for Xorg 7
2006-03-09T11:22:00.000Z	ompaul	bthornton	please discuss dapper in #ubuntu+1
2007-11-21T23:57:00.000Z	ompaul	bthornton	it is suggested to go incrementally - however I suggest you download a 7.10 disk and work from there - reason - less overall downloads
