2007-11-07T03:30:00.000Z	homanj		does Ubuntu/Linux take advantage of dual-cores if a processor has them?
2007-11-07T03:32:00.000Z	preaction	homanj	yes, that's what "SMP" means in 'uname -a'
2007-11-07T03:33:00.000Z	preaction	homanj	though i believe the "generic" kernel has SMP enabled by default
2007-11-07T03:36:00.000Z	homanj	preaction	thanks.
