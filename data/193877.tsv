2006-03-22T12:57:00.000Z	Psykus		having a really horrible problem with gnome freezing up, and then not being able to do anything else..i kept having this problem before, and managed to fix it somehow with help from this channel, but I reinstalled ubuntu and its coming back. it had something to do with RAM if I remember right, maybe running out, but I do have 1 GB of memory, so it must be something in linux
2006-03-22T12:57:00.000Z	Psykus		once it freezes up I mean, I have to restart my computer
2006-03-22T12:58:00.000Z	Psykus		i'm in irssi right now, on the console, so it won't freakout and make me reboot
2006-03-22T12:59:00.000Z	dansan	Psykus	processor overheating can also cause that
