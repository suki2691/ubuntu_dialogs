2009-12-24T09:22:00.000Z	ethereality		Is there a program that "crops" audio files? I'd like to edit some recordings in terms of length, possibly cut out middle pieces, etc.

2009-12-24T09:23:00.000Z	ethereality	teraboy	I'll check into it, thanks, but I thought it was music playback software like Rhythmbox
2009-12-24T09:23:00.000Z	teraboy	ethereality	nope, more of an editor : http://audacity.sourceforge.net/
