2011-01-21T20:21:00.000Z	jera		can anyone help me with an auto update problem? (wireless not working after update)
2011-01-21T20:22:00.000Z	nikolam	jera	what ubuntu release and can you connect alternatively to internet and report bug with ubuntu-bug linux
2011-01-21T20:24:00.000Z	jera	nikolam	i think it is 10.4 the fancy one (multimedia like edition) that comes with dell 1018
2011-01-21T20:29:00.000Z	nikolam	jera	I dont know what fancy one is. I can only think it might be ubuntu with medibuntu repository or kubuntu and working fancy. If it came with Dell, it may me under Dell support contract or Canonical one. Might try that, but eather way, try to update connecting alternatively via LAN and then do update and if wireless problem persist, use ubuntu-bug linux to describe and report upgrade bug (you would need launchapd account)
