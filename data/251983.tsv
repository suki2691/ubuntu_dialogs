2006-11-25T12:13:00.000Z	robbbb		anyone in here got a clue about server installations?
2006-11-25T12:13:00.000Z	robbbb		i'll tell you why - becuase nobody usually knows the answer
2006-11-25T12:13:00.000Z	eyequeue	robbbb	the server cd is typically the best starting point
2006-11-25T12:15:00.000Z	eyequeue	robbbb	that's hardware i'm not familiar with, perhaps the alternate cd?  or the bot's url upcoming?
