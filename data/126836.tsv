2007-10-18T20:21:00.000Z	MattR37		Quick question for a dual boot, XP/Gutsy, install...  Since gutsy can now read/write NTFS, there is not really a need for a 'common' FAT32 partition to share data, correct?
2007-10-18T20:22:00.000Z	remix5x	MattR37	correct, I am running just fine and seeing 2 out of 3 of my windows drive (the only one i cant see is a raid 5 array)
