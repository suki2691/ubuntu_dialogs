2011-02-22T08:36:00.000Z	chikokishi		I just installed ubuntu 10.10 again, i am afraid to update it because everytime i do i get internet errors, sound problems, and two ubuntu loaders.  Help?
2011-02-22T08:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chikokishi	2 ubuntu loaders? Don't you mean 2 kernels?
2011-02-22T08:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chikokishi	yes, one is an updated kernel. If the new kernel is ok (test it a few days) then you can remove the older kernel if you want to save ~120Mb space
2011-02-22T08:39:00.000Z	chikokishi	ActionParsnip	what exactly is a kernel?  Also. as i said my errors dont start till after the update.  I lose internet in one, and sound in the other
