2012-01-11T11:16:00.000Z	Chipzzz	rainbowwarrior	does it unfreeze and continue eventually?
2012-01-11T11:21:00.000Z	Chipzzz	rainbowwarrior	dariushall21 was right, it's just a program hanging... not much can be done about it
2012-01-11T11:28:00.000Z	Chipzzz	rainbowwarrior	have you downloaded the drivers from nVidia's website?
