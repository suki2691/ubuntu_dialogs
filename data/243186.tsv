2011-10-12T15:55:00.000Z	sajimon		hello, im having tough timer mapping samba server share on mine ubuntu machine via cifs, cant anyone check this error http://wklej.org/id/606686/
2011-10-12T15:56:00.000Z	reisi	sajimon	just like phlak_user said; authentication (or perhaps authorization) error
2011-10-12T15:56:00.000Z	sajimon	phlak_user	im sure password is okay, in fact its working on another linux machine
2011-10-12T15:58:00.000Z	reisi	sajimon	could it be that you cannot have two connections with the same authentication? (just guessing)
