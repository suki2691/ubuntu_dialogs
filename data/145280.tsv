2012-01-03T05:37:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	Zarathu	I think it's not part of a file permission
2012-01-03T05:38:00.000Z	Zarathu	RenatoSilva	It's on a single file in the entire directory--just a bunch of images. Driving me crazy, not knowing what's up with that file. :P
2012-01-03T05:39:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	Zarathu	no idea what's that, sorry
