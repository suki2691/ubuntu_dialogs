2008-05-09T07:48:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	venalicio	I got lockups when I tried Ubuntu on a system with a 9550. I ended up switching the fglrx drivers off. At this point in time, if you want decent 3D on Linux then nVidia is still the best choice
2008-05-09T07:52:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	venalicio	Back when I had my 9500 Pro (on Gentoo) there was one screensaver that always managed to lock the drivers up. I forget what it was, but disabling it worked a treat. Still, I got instances where the system wouldn't even start up rioght in Ubuntu. I just gave up in the end.
