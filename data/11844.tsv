2011-07-22T18:01:00.000Z	dyd		guys i have an empty 250 hd that is all unallocated
2011-07-22T18:01:00.000Z	dyd		what should i do in order to use it to store data?
2011-07-22T18:03:00.000Z	alazare619	dyd	 if its for storage ext3 or 4 if its a main drive i prefer ext2 as its quicker and has less redundancy and writes to the drive but thats just my personal prefrence
2011-07-22T18:04:00.000Z	dyd	alazare619	since it's for storage i'll use ext4, thank you
