2008-12-02T16:27:00.000Z	erbi	DJones	im running ubuntu 8.10 64bit, should i use 1.2.1(from my synaptic package manager or 1.4 ?
2008-12-02T16:28:00.000Z	erbi		err lemme rephrase the question...
2008-12-02T16:29:00.000Z	DJones	erbi	I would stick with with the version in the repo's, that way if there are any security updates you get them automatically, if you install from a non-ubuntu repo, you might find that you don't get future updates
