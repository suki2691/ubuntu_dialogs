2010-08-14T02:16:00.000Z	distant2		i'd like to know, when having ubuntu+windows on a system, if there's a risk for the windows personal data files to be accessed from ubuntu (via the inter/network) and vice versa.
2010-08-14T02:17:00.000Z	Oer	distant2	no risk. as long as you do not mount it, ubuntu will not acces a windows partition.
2010-08-14T02:18:00.000Z	distant2	Oer	what is mounting? and also how does ubuntu get installed from within windows (inside the ntfs partition?)
2010-08-14T02:19:00.000Z	Oer	distant2	installing inside windows, you use WUBI for that.
