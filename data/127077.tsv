2009-04-05T10:11:00.000Z	PCTeacher012		Yea, i did, lol, well, what is the code again so i can save as file? (Is there something like .bat for ubuntu 8.1)
2009-04-05T10:12:00.000Z	vocx	PCTeacher012	you can save any commands as shell scripts, which you can execute. Typically they end with .sh
2009-04-05T10:18:00.000Z	vocx	PCTeacher012	the shell script is to be run from the terminal, like "sh MyScript.sh"  but a launcher does that in a graphical way. So it's your choice.
