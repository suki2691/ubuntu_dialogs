2005-08-28T12:32:00.000Z	Rug		I have a bug (I don't know if it has been documented yet) that is easy to reproduce.  Care to smack me with a FAQ or what/where should I go?   It involves kernel 2.6.10-5-k7 and Nvidia (apt-get) driver.
2005-08-28T12:33:00.000Z	dalamar	Rug	install linux-k7 package
2005-08-28T12:33:00.000Z	Rug	Vash	ok sorry
2005-08-28T12:33:00.000Z	dalamar	Rug	if your talking about X not booting after the k7 kernel install
