2008-02-01T21:30:00.000Z	bahadunn		how can I take a ubuntu package and turn it into a debian package?
2008-02-01T21:30:00.000Z	bahadunn		I need libapache2-mod-layout 5.0 which ubuntu has a .deb for but debian does not
2008-02-01T21:31:00.000Z	nickrud	bahadunn	if in doubt, find the source package and build it on debian
