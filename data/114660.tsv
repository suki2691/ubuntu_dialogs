2009-02-04T05:08:00.000Z	trent1		hi , i have a simply yes-no-answer question
2009-02-04T05:09:00.000Z	trent1		is it possible to have two different wallpapers? like when you go from one workspace to another, can they independent background?
2009-02-04T05:10:00.000Z	binarymutant	trent1	not possible with gnome :/
2009-02-04T05:12:00.000Z	binarymutant	trent1	don't quote me on it but I think compiz might have a plugin that can do that
