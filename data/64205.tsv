2010-10-10T21:13:00.000Z	bthornton		I've downloaded/burned Ubuntu 10.10 to a DVD and would like to upgrade my 10.04 machine with it. Is this possible? I haven't been able to find instructions on upgrading from burned media (only network)
2010-10-10T21:14:00.000Z	xangua	bthornton	only with the alternate cd, not the live cd
2010-10-10T21:14:00.000Z	bthornton	xangua	I have burned the alternate CD. What is the procedure for upgrading?
2010-10-10T21:15:00.000Z	bthornton	xangua	ah, I just have to pop in the CD and click "Upgrade Now". awesome :)
