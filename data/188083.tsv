2008-11-13T01:05:00.000Z	Winkie	erUSUL	it probably requires an mta, use aptitude so you can explore the depends
2011-01-05T21:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	Winkie	maybe it now uses upstart? /etc/init/* ?
2011-01-05T21:58:00.000Z	Winkie	erUSUL	it does use upstart, but it doesn't seem to unpack the upstart script
