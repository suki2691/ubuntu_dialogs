2005-07-01T14:13:00.000Z	Cybermagellan		I installed webmin from synaptic....however it is supposed to be webbased and I can't find anything for it....how am I supposed to access it anyone?
2005-07-01T14:14:00.000Z	slept	Cybermagellan	its' on https://localhost:10000
2005-07-01T14:15:00.000Z	slept	Cybermagellan	but to use webmin with ubuntu you'll need to create a webmin-root account there is a script that comes with webmin to do so
2005-07-01T14:21:00.000Z	slept	Cybermagellan	it's /usr/share/webmin/changepass.pl /etc/webmin root <your passwordhere>
