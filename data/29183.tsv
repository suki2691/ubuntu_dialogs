2012-03-19T21:13:00.000Z	Aikar		anyone got any ideas on what else to try with black screen after pressing "Install Ubuntu" ? Samsung RC512 Laptop with SSD. I've tried nomodeset, nosplash, noquiet, leaving splash/queit off, gfxpayload=text, hooking external monitor up to see if it was getting the picture, noveuau.modeset=0 and vesafb.nonsense=1
