2005-10-07T09:03:00.000Z	Aardvark		I'm pretty new to Linux, so I need to ask...is Ubuntu difficult to install?
2005-10-07T09:03:00.000Z	kurtbec	Aardvark	its not bad at all.
2005-10-07T09:04:00.000Z	kurtbec	Aardvark	Gentoo isn't hard just much more involved.
2005-10-07T09:05:00.000Z	kurtbec	Aardvark	I really like Gentoo, but the compiling just finally got to me so I'm either going with kubuntu or Fedora we'll see what wins out
