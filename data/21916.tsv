2011-01-07T05:07:00.000Z	ryan_	ks07	i can't really alter the screen physically by very much
2011-01-07T05:08:00.000Z	ks07	ryan_	I dont know then, I dont see anything to do it in nvidia settings here :S
2011-01-07T05:10:00.000Z	ryan_	ks07	yeah it's weird because when i was using an ATi card you could sort of move the screen about in Catalyst.
