2007-02-18T12:26:00.000Z	pavs		I was following a Howto and somehow made a shorcut (link to) of a folder inside a folder ie /var/www/www/www everytime I click on www folder there is a shorcut of www inside the folder, not sure what I did . How do I remove it (not the folder but the link)
2007-02-18T12:27:00.000Z	carthik	pavs	just open the dir up in nautilus, and delete the link.
2007-02-18T12:28:00.000Z	carthik	pavs	or in a terminal, browse to the dir with the link and say $rm <linkname>
