2005-02-16T06:10:00.000Z	thully		Hi - I wondered if anyone here who runs hoary has had major breakage after a dist-upgrade (meaning, X doesn't start, or you can't log on)?
2005-02-16T06:12:00.000Z	thully		Well - I heard X was fixed yesterday
2005-02-16T06:12:00.000Z	thully		well, if I go in here and ask "Is there any major breakage" before doing a dist-upgrade that contains major updates, am I safe?
2005-02-16T06:14:00.000Z	neom	thully	- You whould be safe.
