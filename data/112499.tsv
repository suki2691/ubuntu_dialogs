2007-11-29T14:46:00.000Z	Puchti		ive got a question about a database: i want to organize my home banking and Budget Paper things in a database like mySQL - just because it sucks to do these things in different programms like gnucash and excel/Calc. thats why i switched to linux/ubuntu last week. So my question is: mySQL is very hard to learn (for me) is there any other database solution easy to use like just as a text file...
2007-11-29T14:46:00.000Z	Puchti		...or something?

2007-11-29T14:48:00.000Z	Puchti	ikonia	i know, but mySQL is a littlebit to much for me- i just want a db - easy to use and safe
