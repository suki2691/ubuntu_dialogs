2009-03-03T23:06:00.000Z	kopolee11		hello everyone. I am thinking about downgrading from 64-bit 8.10 ubuntu to 32-bit 8.10 ubuntu. The reason is to run apps like google gears and tweetdeck without the hassle. Does anyone know if there will be many hassles. (I have a seprate home partition)
2009-03-03T23:08:00.000Z	kopolee11		ok, thanks defrysk. and just to make clear, i'm not downgrading to an older form of ubuntu, just the 32 bit version, because it runs more apps
2009-03-03T23:09:00.000Z	kopolee11		thanks again defrysk
