2005-02-10T13:07:00.000Z	shushi2005		Would someon help me configure my network card? I have an Inspiron 4100 and a SS1021 wireless adapter. Both the power and connection lights are lit constantly but I have no connection or interface to configure. Can anyone help?

2005-02-10T13:08:00.000Z	shushi2005	pdaoust	thanks for your concern :) i am kinda lost though, orinoco_cs doesn't work though I am told it should...
2005-02-10T13:09:00.000Z	pdaoust	shushi2005	yeah, sorry I couldn't help, but you seemed desperate, so I thought I'd let you know someone noticed you there ^_^ no money, personally, to buy wireless
