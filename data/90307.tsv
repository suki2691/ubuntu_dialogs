2009-11-02T00:00:00.000Z	Jaredu		can anyone explain why flash is being absolutely retarded for me in 9.10? I cannot click pause on youtube videos, the volume slider is finicky, and videos on pages don't often load if they are embedded flash. Help?

2009-11-02T00:02:00.000Z	earthling	Jaredu	 it sometimes messes with the flash plugin
2009-11-02T00:11:00.000Z	Jaredu	earthling	SWF plugin is the only thing powering my flash, if I disable it, flash doesn't play :( Tried installing the plugin by itself, restricted extras, it seems buggy with 3.5.. hmm
