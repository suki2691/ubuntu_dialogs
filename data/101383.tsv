2008-02-04T07:13:00.000Z	Geezle		Hey, me again.  I still can't compile alsa-driver.  I have all the proper headers installed (AFAIK) but I still get the same error: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/54655/
2008-02-04T07:13:00.000Z	Geezle		I'm thoroughly confused

2008-02-04T07:16:00.000Z	Geezle	Jack_Sparrow	thanks, but I've been there and tried that.  I'm seriously running out of ideas.  Recompiling ALSA might do the trick if I could only get it to compile
