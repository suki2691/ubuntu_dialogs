2010-09-24T23:04:00.000Z	egadw	yautja_cetanu2	tried the monitor app in GNOME?
2010-09-24T23:04:00.000Z	yautja_cetanu2	egadw	Is that "monitor preferences" from the status bar at the top? If so yes
2010-09-24T23:05:00.000Z	yautja_cetanu2	egadw	The wierd thing is that it is the external monitor that works. The monitor on my laptop doesn't work
