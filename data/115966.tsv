2008-11-11T19:04:00.000Z	thedefender		i have a question, when i boot into recovery mode and go to root shell i am able to edit files on my system without having to use a password, why is this,
2008-11-11T19:04:00.000Z	Delvien	thedefender	are you editing your own non-root files?
2008-11-11T19:07:00.000Z	thedefender	Delvien	i just know i can edit and save files, read system directories, seems kinda scary that someone can just walk up and get into root, i can't see my home files though
