2011-01-10T03:51:00.000Z	mdgeorge		I'm trying to apply some patches to my kernel.  I used apt-get source to retreive it, and patched it up.  Now I'm wondering how to turn that source back into a .deb that I can install
2011-01-10T03:51:00.000Z	mdgeorge		can anyone point me in the right direction?
2011-01-10T03:52:00.000Z	Onepamopa	mdgeorge	u can configure it too before making it .deb
