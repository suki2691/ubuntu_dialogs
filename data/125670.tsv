2008-07-03T22:30:00.000Z	Oyama		i have some troubles with hardy livecd, i'd like to mount a ntfs partition, but i can't find a way to be able to write on it... it says the disk is mounted read-only, but 'mount' tells me it is mounted with the option 'rw'
2008-07-03T22:31:00.000Z	fumbalah	Oyama	I think it has something to do with ntfs-3g support
2008-07-03T22:31:00.000Z	Oyama	fumbalah	isn't ntfs-3g the default in hardy?
