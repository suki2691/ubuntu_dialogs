2007-03-12T09:59:00.000Z	floresc77		I have a quick question for someone.  I am currently using the live cd and I am trying to install 6.10.  I have having issues with installing because the resolution is too low, 640x480.  I have tried to reconfigure the xorg.conf and force at least 1024x768 but everytime i restart the xserver it is still at 640x480.  What else should i try?

2007-03-12T10:01:00.000Z	Pelo	floresc77	 might be a refresh rate issue
