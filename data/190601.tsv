2006-05-04T10:53:00.000Z	crunchyfish		i've downloaded both the 32 and 64 bit isos of ubuntu and burned each twice, and tried using each burnt disc 3-4 times each and every time i try to install it'll go through the process of copying the files, restarting, and then it will freeze at about 70-80%
2006-05-04T10:53:00.000Z	crunchyfish		is this common?
2006-05-04T10:54:00.000Z	crunchyfish		i didn't, nalioth. do you think that could be an issue?
2006-05-04T10:54:00.000Z	imbrandon	crunchyfish	no its not common, did you try debug setting like turing off acpi at boot ?
