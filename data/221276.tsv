2006-03-23T12:19:00.000Z	BlueEagle	chasmarang	sounds like you've upgraded or recompiled your kernel but not your kernel modules (or not installed them)
2006-03-23T12:20:00.000Z	BlueEagle	chasmarang	Did you compile your own kernel?
2006-03-23T12:21:00.000Z	BlueEagle	chasmarang	Well after your new kernel is compiled run make modules_install to install the new modules.
