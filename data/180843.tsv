2006-06-19T11:24:00.000Z	_Spire_	neutrinomass	disabling what?
2006-06-19T11:25:00.000Z	neutrinomass	_Spire_	Not by default. I'm not sure about such editors - I know about KSysv. Then again, a user shouldn't be expected to edit a runlevel (what's that again? :P ) to disable their network device
2006-06-19T11:25:00.000Z	neutrinomass	_Spire_	"deactivate" in network-admin
