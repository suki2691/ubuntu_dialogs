2006-05-02T16:44:00.000Z	jobezone	fensta	yep :)
2006-05-02T16:53:00.000Z	jobezone	fensta	see the end of my webpage: http://jobezone.wordpress.com/2006/03/07/aspire-3003lmi-on-debian-testing-etch/#more-10 . except gdebi, that isn't available for ubuntu breezy, the remaining programs are the ones I use in a Gnome environment.
2006-05-02T16:57:00.000Z	jobezone	fensta	ah, yes. I've tried one or two rss readers for gdesklets, but didn't like it that much...
