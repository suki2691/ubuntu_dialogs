2006-05-27T11:21:00.000Z	CharlesE	tonyyarusso	:) RC1, If i am having problems in the next 30min ill just wait for that
2006-05-27T11:23:00.000Z	CharlesE	tonyyarusso	do you know where the first hosts\mirrors will be so i can get the release candidate as soon as possible?
2006-05-27T11:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	CharlesE	I would guess the archive.ubuntu.com one without a country code.  But it might get swamped, and the other official ones will be on it pretty quick.
