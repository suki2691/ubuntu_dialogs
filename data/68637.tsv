2009-07-06T04:21:00.000Z	MK13	Jeruvy	cause i have a partition in an extended volume from when i had too many primary partitions and just want to have all primary partitions
2009-07-06T04:21:00.000Z	Jeruvy	MK13	you can only have 4
2009-07-06T04:23:00.000Z	Jeruvy	MK13	the best bet would be to image the partition, wipe it out, and recreate it as primary then restore it
