2012-07-27T05:23:00.000Z	Yadra	WaffleScratch	hmm, I can't seem to get it to accept a if=/dev/<device> path
2012-07-27T05:24:00.000Z	Yadra	WaffleScratch	it's a USB flash drive
2012-07-27T05:31:00.000Z	Yadra	WaffleScratch	yikes, I guess it's working now! (I'm viewing the ascii-ified contents of the volume scroll by in the terminal! xD [because I set no output file])
