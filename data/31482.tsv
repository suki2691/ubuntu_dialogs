2010-07-05T14:44:00.000Z	lxsys		I'm getting a kick-ass four 3.2 GHz xeon processor workstation delivered today, but it has no graphics card. I'm not an expert at graphics. Would anybody be able to advise me on a suitable card? It has AGP and PCI slots, no PCI express. I require something with two VGA outputs and at least 256mb of graphics ram. Thanks in advance.
