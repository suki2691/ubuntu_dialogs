2009-01-02T00:45:00.000Z	victorlf	gpled	because they are not added instantly to the repositories, the installers are made and they are tested first
2009-01-02T00:46:00.000Z	gpled	victorlf	so when the old version stops working, because it is to old, or worse, when a security issue arises in the old version, should we just uninstall and install from source?
