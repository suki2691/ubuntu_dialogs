2006-10-20T15:06:00.000Z	iks		I've got a quick question
2006-10-20T15:08:00.000Z	iks		I'd like to run an Apache Server. So I installed XAMPP. But part of the files' owner is iks (me) and part of its is nobody. In fact the Root's mine and the /phpmyadmin is nobody's. How can I make this work without running the server under root or changing all the file's owner ?
