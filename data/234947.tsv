2011-03-02T20:15:00.000Z	CarlFK	ZeroZiat	it depends on what apps and how much memory they need.  if you don't know, go with the defaults.
2011-03-02T20:16:00.000Z	CarlFK	ZeroZiat	use 2 gig. or 6 if you don't like 2.
2011-03-02T20:17:00.000Z	CarlFK	ZeroZiat	swap size was more of an issue 10 years ago when ram was expensive and disks were small.  that stuff has grown faster than apps use it.
