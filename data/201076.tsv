2008-03-07T20:10:00.000Z	Daveeey		can anyone tell me the advantage of 64bit?
2008-03-07T20:12:00.000Z	vlt	Daveeey	You can address more RAM directly, and some 64bit optimised operations/programs should run faster (maybe ssl, aes, databases?)
2008-03-07T20:13:00.000Z	vlt	Daveeey	I'd reccommend it for running on servers w/o desktop environment at the moment.
