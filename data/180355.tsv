2006-06-15T05:56:00.000Z	Muzik_		hey all, i just have a quick question: i have a laptop with Ubuntu 6.06 on it ... every time i close the lid it 'locks' my screen.  How do i disable this?
2006-06-15T05:57:00.000Z	corhere	Muzik_	there's a setting in gnome-power-manager for that i believe
2006-06-15T06:01:00.000Z	Muzik_	corhere	there are two gnome-power things.. manager and preferences... manager refuses to start (says dbus isnt running, but /etc/init.d/ says it is)... and preferences  it seems it is already set to 'blank screen' ... and changing it to "do nothing" still causes it to lock
