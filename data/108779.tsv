2008-12-29T13:39:00.000Z	xun		Hello, I've managed to make the tp_smapi working on my thinkpad t400, but there is one part of the instruction i don't understand(from the thinkwiki site). it says:
2008-12-29T13:39:00.000Z	xun		    "add the force_io=1 module parameter to thinkpad_ec in /etc/modprobe.conf (or your distribution's equivalent"
2008-12-29T13:39:00.000Z	xun		I'm running ubuntu 8.10 intrepid, there is no modprobe.conf file, only "modprobe.d/" folder, and I couldn't find "tinkpad_ec" in there in any of the files. which file should I edit and how should I edit it? thanks for your help.
