2005-08-01T13:16:00.000Z	test34		I have DSL modem, and when I access a web page sometimes it shows the modem configuration page instead of the web page I asked for.. If I try to reload it, it works fine.. but then it can do it again 2 minutes later.. (I use firefox..)
2005-08-01T13:18:00.000Z	test34		could that problem be caused by firefox being upgraded without first uninstalling the old version ?
