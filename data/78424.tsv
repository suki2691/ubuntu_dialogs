2008-09-25T23:25:00.000Z	cars__		I am trying to transfer a large number of files between two computers over a firewire cable.  One is running Ubuntu and the other is running Vista (shudder).  I looked at the Wiki page for Ethernet over Firewire but am confused.  Is what I am attempting to do possible?  My other method available to me is transferring via flash drive, but one computer does not have USB 2.0.
