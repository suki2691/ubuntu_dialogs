2006-06-03T05:41:00.000Z	VMaN_hung_over		quick question on installing, DD, I've had bad experiences with repartitioning before, but is it safe to resize my NTFS partition?
2006-06-03T05:41:00.000Z	didar	VMaN_hung_over	Don't mess with NTFS
2006-06-03T05:42:00.000Z	didar	VMaN_hung_over	would most certainly screw the NTFS
2006-06-03T05:43:00.000Z	didar	VMaN_hung_over	yo should backup your data and *then* get adventorous with no gurantees
