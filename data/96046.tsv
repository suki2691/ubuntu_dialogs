2010-04-26T20:29:00.000Z	Vaevictus		all i want to do is upgrade libwwwperl ... and apparently i need to upgrade linux, mysql, apache2, postgre, python, sudo, grub and everything else almost, on a system.
2010-04-26T20:31:00.000Z	Vaevictus		so i feel a bit scared about touching everything on the system without my control... on a live webserver with clients on it
