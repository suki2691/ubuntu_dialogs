2008-03-21T06:03:00.000Z	noble-		I installed ubuntu on a dual boot with vista. I have tons of free space on the vista partition, but only about 9gb on Ubuntu's partition. Is there a way I can dedicate more of vista's freespace to Ubuntu without destroying either OS?
2008-03-21T06:04:00.000Z	Al-Khouli	noble-	u can resize ur vista partition from inside vista
2008-03-21T06:04:00.000Z	Al-Khouli	noble-	then mount /home for instance on that partition
2008-03-21T06:05:00.000Z	Al-Khouli	noble-	i mean the freed one
