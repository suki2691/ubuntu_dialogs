2012-10-20T02:26:00.000Z	epicfail		hey... i would like to run a ubuntu straight from usb-stick as a full OS. Any idea how i can do that?
2012-10-20T02:26:00.000Z	bekks	epicfail	Install Ubuntu on that stick, and just boot from it.
2012-10-20T02:27:00.000Z	epicfail	bekks	thats what i did... gives a very poor performance...
2012-10-20T02:27:00.000Z	bekks	epicfail	Then I'd change the stick with a faster one.
