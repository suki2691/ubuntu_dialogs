2005-10-23T08:14:00.000Z	MutinyTunes		hi :)  i keep getting a lot of messages like this when trying to apt-get install something...  i have the 'universe multiverse' line uncommented from /etc/apt/sources.list and I'm using breezy --   apache2-mpm-prefork: Depends: apache2-common (= 2.0.54-4ubuntu2) but 2.0.54-5ubuntu2 is to be installed
2005-10-23T08:15:00.000Z	MutinyTunes		notice the 4ubuntu2 vs 5ubuntu2 stuff.  how do i remedy that?
