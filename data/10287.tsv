2011-08-22T03:19:00.000Z	scythefwd_		the extended is just a second type of partition.  You can have up to 4 primary partitions, and each primary can have an extended partition...
2011-08-22T03:21:00.000Z	ProphetZ	scythefwd_	the one in the desktop is supported, unsure about the laptop, but it's a Dell so I'd be very surprised if it wasn't. I'm trying to boot from CD and view the partitions again but nothing is working since I tried Install.
