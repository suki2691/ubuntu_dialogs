2008-07-11T18:41:00.000Z	[k0d3]||4[tran]		Hey - I am having some stability and crashing problems with the GNOME desktop that I installed on my ubuntu-server 8.04 installation. I am looking to add a faster and more stable GUI. After research - Xfce seems like what I will be going with. However, does anyone have recommendations for faster and more stable GUIs?

2008-07-11T18:44:00.000Z	[k0d3]||4[tran]	PingFloyd_	thank you. I will look into that
2008-07-11T18:52:00.000Z	[k0d3]||4[tran]	PingFloyd_	would you say there is as much support and compatibility with IceWM as there is with Xfce or GNOME? I've been researching it and cannot find out that much about it.
