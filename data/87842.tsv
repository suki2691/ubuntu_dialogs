2008-07-01T09:24:00.000Z	Brian88		hi all, how to enable compiz? I cannot enable it (http://paste.ubuntu.com/24139/)
2008-07-01T09:24:00.000Z	crdlb	Brian88	why on earth would you run compiz as root?
2008-07-01T09:25:00.000Z	Brian88	crdlb	if I run it without sudo, the result will be same
2008-07-01T09:25:00.000Z	crdlb	Brian88	indeed, and you should join #compiz-fusion for help with that, but you should never even consider running a window manager with sudo
