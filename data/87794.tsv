2008-11-07T22:03:00.000Z	Twinkletoes|W		Using yppasswd <user> to change a user's password under NIS, I'm asked to supply the root password before the user's new password (I've already done sudo su - and am at a root prompt).  Given that by default, the root password on Ubuntu is scrambled, what can I do without setting a root password to make this work?
