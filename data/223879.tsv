2009-05-06T01:34:00.000Z	paco		i installed ubuntu 9.04 beta (like a month ago) and i updated the system, but i think something still wrong with my system so i wanted to reinstall ubuntu 9.04  again. If there is like a command to do it (I dont need to make a backup)
2009-05-06T01:35:00.000Z	paco		so i have to download the iso file
2009-05-06T01:35:00.000Z	th0r	paco	when you reinstall just tell the installation to format the partition
2009-05-18T02:51:00.000Z	th0r	paco	and using the windows install will wipe out grub
