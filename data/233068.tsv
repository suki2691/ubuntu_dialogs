2010-10-15T01:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	kevin_	well you do not have the three cards working at once? do you?
2010-10-15T01:27:00.000Z	kevin_	erUSUL	yes, they are all working at the same time, and they do work, but they don't have the most up to date driver, I am trying to isntall them via the cli, but can't have gdm running at the same time.
