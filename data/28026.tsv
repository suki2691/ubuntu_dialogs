2010-10-11T17:20:00.000Z	gtm		hi...is there a way to import working drivers from a previous kernel to a newer one?
2010-10-11T17:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	gtm	no; you have to recompile them if you builded from source
2010-10-11T17:22:00.000Z	gtm	erUSUL	i say this because my webcam works only with kernel 2.6.19 or lower....
2010-10-11T17:23:00.000Z	gtm	erUSUL	in few words...it works only with jaunty... but no karmic, intrepid, lucid, maverick...
