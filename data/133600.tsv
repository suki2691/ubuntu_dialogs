2007-05-21T08:00:00.000Z	LittleJim68		A question I was not able to find in the forums;  I have lots of older ATA harddrives but want to install ubuntu/XP dual boot on my newer SATA drives.  Problem is I switch out ATA drives all the time and this changes the harddrive # in Grub.  Is there a way I can still dual boot and switch out ATA drives all the time?
