2009-08-04T17:44:00.000Z	Celestar		I'm just wondering why I cannot remove the autoeth0 conn, or do anything with it for that matter.
2009-08-04T17:45:00.000Z	sol931	Celestar	maybe you want to try wicd instead of network manager.
2009-08-04T17:51:00.000Z	sol931	Celestar	because Network Manager isnt so good... i prefer wicd.
2009-08-04T17:51:00.000Z	sol931	Celestar	you probably can (i dont know how), but if you did, you wouldn't have found the real problem. I'd suggest you keep researching the problem
