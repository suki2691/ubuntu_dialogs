2012-08-19T01:21:00.000Z	Toph2		ok
2012-08-19T01:21:00.000Z	gunarm	Toph2	have you ever read ANYTHING about raid, "Raid is not backup" is said so many times its basically an annoying cliche, how do you not know that?
2012-08-19T01:27:00.000Z	gunarm	Toph2	currently i am ashamed to say I don't have a backup, but that will change when I get the money, too much data for online backup, so ill have to buy another 10tb of drives and do a weekly rsync and then take the backups to work for safe keeping
