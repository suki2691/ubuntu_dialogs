2007-08-22T11:20:00.000Z	luite_	thedash	you might like amarok if you want a library, at least if you don't hate KDE ;) (or maybe even if you do)
2007-08-22T11:20:00.000Z	thedash	luite_	:: I use amarok, but it has other problems for sure
2007-08-22T11:21:00.000Z	luite_	thedash	an its main problem is that it doesn't try to be a winamp clone/ ;)
