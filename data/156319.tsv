2009-11-14T04:40:00.000Z	Doorman352		Im experimenting with Ubuntu Server 9.04, is webmin the only gui interface? Ive heard that the gnome/kde ones can be used but people kringe when I ask. Want to learn/play - not production.
2009-11-14T04:40:00.000Z	genii	Doorman352	webmin is not supposed to be an interface at all to ubuntu-server, it was removed for security concerns and replaced in the repos with ebox
2009-11-14T04:41:00.000Z	genii	Doorman352	You may also want to ask ubuntu server specific questions in the proper channel, which is #ubuntu-server
2009-11-14T04:44:00.000Z	genii	Doorman352	Not really. But there are some questions which are specific to the server distribution which more help can be found in the specific channel (like web gui interfaces, how to set dns, email servers, and so on)
