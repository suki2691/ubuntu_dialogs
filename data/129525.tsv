2008-03-15T20:02:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	sirjoebob	aren't bash scripts for the command prompt only?
2008-03-15T20:03:00.000Z	sirjoebob		Bo^Dick., if you put it into a file and save it as ".sh" you can run it from command... you would add "directory and filename.sh" as a session startup iem
2008-03-15T20:03:00.000Z	sirjoebob	Bo^Dick	works fine for me
