2006-12-03T06:47:00.000Z	mikedoty		I'm trying to use a gamepad I just bought with the zsnes emulator.  It recognizes all of the button presses, but I can't seem to get it to respond to the d-pad.  Any ideas?
2006-12-03T06:47:00.000Z	matthew_	mikedoty	is there a config file that you can edit?
2006-12-03T06:48:00.000Z	matthew_	mikedoty	try looking under /etc for a config file for the emulator
