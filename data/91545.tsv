2009-09-03T04:21:00.000Z	cxo		My computer has a Core 2 Duo, should I use 64bit or 32bit Ubuntu?
2009-09-03T04:22:00.000Z	joaopinto	cxo	you can use 64 bits, it's your choice
2009-09-03T04:23:00.000Z	cxo	joaopinto	will I have any problem setting it up or is the software just the same to setup like in the 32bit version?
2009-09-03T04:23:00.000Z	joaopinto	cxo	it's the same software
