2008-07-09T17:54:00.000Z	IdleOne	chakir	why use windows instead of linux? both Q's are offtopic. use Debian if you like
2008-07-09T17:55:00.000Z	chakir	IdleOne	but there wasn't the same comparission, Ubuntu and Debia are both Linux, Xp and Linux are different OS
2008-07-09T18:05:00.000Z	chakir	IdleOne	but in that case only for windows users' securuty right? not for us under linux
