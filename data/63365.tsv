2010-06-05T21:31:00.000Z	Tecna	acicula	Really?  That's weird, because I change my root password all the time.
2010-06-05T21:32:00.000Z	acicula	Tecna	well if you set it yourself then obviously there will be one, its not set by default however
2010-06-05T21:34:00.000Z	Tecna	acicula	Seriously...  I read about the scrambled password in docs written by ubuntu devs.  Also, if there were no password, you'd be able to login without entering a password.
