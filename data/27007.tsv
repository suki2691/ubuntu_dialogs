2011-01-18T23:13:00.000Z	sda_	JackyAlcine	Hibernate need almost the same time as turn it on, the only difference is I can keep work as before, but i only need low power for don't wait too much from a session of work and another, i waste 40W anyways if i don't UNPLUG the computer from the electric network so i prefer waste them without turn off my pc and have a very fast "start"
