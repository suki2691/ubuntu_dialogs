2011-07-10T07:15:00.000Z	ashly		I installed Ubuntu (Karmic Koala) on my Compaq Presario V5000 laptop. Everything except the Mouse works fine. I even got the wireless working. The mouse freezes quite often. The symptoms are that at seemingly random times, all of the buttons stop working on the mouse, usually when I am using firefox. When this happens, the system will respond to keystrokes. This happens with both the touchpad mouse and an external mouse. The CPU doesn't see

Sometimes it wont come back and I have to reboot. This has gotten so annoying that I am ready to install another OS. Can anyone point me to a thread for this issue, or is there a fix? I've searched and it seems others have the same problem, but I haven't seen any solution
