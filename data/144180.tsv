2007-06-06T15:49:00.000Z	KR-data		I got some partitions from a previous Linux installation, how is the best way to set those up, so my user have rw-permissions?

2007-06-06T15:51:00.000Z	pike_	KR-data	of course thats a horrible answer :)
2007-06-06T15:52:00.000Z	KR-data	pike_	well since I use ext3 and just wan't to know what setup is best, I guess you are right, sorry :p
