2006-06-07T09:46:00.000Z	humbolt		So when will dapper be stable? I am not asking for a release date here, I know it was already released!
2006-06-07T09:47:00.000Z	cge	humbolt	I believe there is supposed to be a significant update in around two weeks.
2006-06-07T09:48:00.000Z	humbolt	cge	so ubuntu is not denying that dapper was not really ready for a release yet?!
2006-06-07T09:49:00.000Z	humbolt	cge	Or is that, what LTS means? If they keep up making this system better and better for the whole LTS periode, I would certainly welcome this strategy.
