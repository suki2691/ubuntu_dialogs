2005-11-07T10:40:00.000Z	Tristan9669		I auto mounted two ntfs partition, but now they show up on the desktop, how do I remove it and just keep it in "computer"?
2005-11-07T10:41:00.000Z	farruinn	Tristan9669	right-click the icons on your desktop>unmount volume
2005-11-07T10:42:00.000Z	Tristan9669	farruinn	I did but It says unable to unmount the selected volume.
2005-11-07T10:43:00.000Z	farruinn	Tristan9669	in your /etc/fstab does the partition have the users optin set?
