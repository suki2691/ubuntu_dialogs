2008-09-25T04:07:00.000Z	trimeta1	deepfriedsquirr1	What do you mean?
2008-09-25T04:08:00.000Z	deepfriedsquirr1	trimeta1	Well, I'm wondering if it would be safe to use a USB key regularly for booting since FAT32 is a Windows filesystem without file permissions
2008-09-25T04:09:00.000Z	trimeta1	deepfriedsquirr1	Oh, you mean for booting. I think you might need a proper Linux filesystem for that.
