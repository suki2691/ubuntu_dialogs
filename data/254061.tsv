2010-12-17T17:48:00.000Z	cool-RR		Is it somehow possible to avoid restarting after installing a video driver?
2010-12-17T17:49:00.000Z	Ileden	cool-RR	probably, but I expect it's more trouble than it's worth.
2010-12-17T17:50:00.000Z	Ileden	cool-RR	ah, that's a very good point, not being able to try the display driver on a live cd, since changes don't survive the reboot... hmm.
