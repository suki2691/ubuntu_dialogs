2008-09-18T01:20:00.000Z	alex65		somebody told me to     sudo echo "id:6:initdefault:">/etc/inittab and that it will make ubuntu faster. I was excited and i tried it but now my ubuntu is weird and reboot by itself. wat should i do ?

2008-09-18T01:22:00.000Z	kitche	alex65	pretty much you told ubuntu to reboot all the time
