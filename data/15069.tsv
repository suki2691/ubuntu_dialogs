2011-04-28T18:01:00.000Z	MohammadAG		is there a way to upgrade without update-manager? dist-upgrade doesn't show any new packages
2011-04-28T18:02:00.000Z	z0mbyk1d	MohammadAG	you need to update, safe-upgrade first
2011-04-28T18:02:00.000Z	z0mbyk1d		so that the new update-manager can be installed
2011-04-28T18:03:00.000Z	MohammadAG	z0mbyk1d	well, update-manager's crashing/hanging when I click upgrade, so I'm looking for another way to do that
