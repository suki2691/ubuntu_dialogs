2011-01-16T12:54:00.000Z	Bluefever		I'm planning on installing windows 7 just so I can play some games on the side, and wanted to know how I can partition my drive properly.
2011-01-16T12:54:00.000Z	Bluefever		I'm running ubuntu 10.10 at the moment
2011-01-16T12:55:00.000Z	edoceo	Bluefever	Make a partition for Windows, instatall to that - re-install the bootloader to undo with Win7 did, boot Win and play games
2011-01-16T13:01:00.000Z	Bluefever	edoceo	I was reading it and wanted to make sure I have it straight. So reinstalling GRUB 2 will allow ubuntu to be the primary OS at startup?
