2010-03-18T15:49:00.000Z	Sato1_		Hello, When I enter  any channel I seem to have all the old chat in there instead of a blank window and the same with PM. How can i stop that and delete the old saved stuff. Thanks
2010-03-18T15:49:00.000Z	rww	Sato1_	which IRC client are you using?
2010-03-18T15:53:00.000Z	rww	Sato1_	I don't think the option's available in xchat-gnome. Normal xchat (in the xchat package) can do it, though.
