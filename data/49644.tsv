2009-12-30T06:45:00.000Z	apn	morf	yes
2009-12-30T06:48:00.000Z	morf	apn	thanks. is the chance of recovering less or equal compared to ext3?
2009-12-30T06:51:00.000Z	apn	morf	the same. ext3 is well established and tested, ext4 is pretty well tested and just getting established. both work as advertised.
