2009-01-15T20:36:00.000Z	dual		I've got a Gmail account, and I would like to backup my emails. I use the Web interface for the most of the time, but I want a copy in thunderbird. Should I use Pop or Imap?

2009-01-15T20:37:00.000Z	sekrisme	dual	but you can config it to so it doesnt really matter what protocol you use
2009-01-15T20:38:00.000Z	sekrisme	dual	pop3 would probably be a setting less to set =)
