2006-04-21T08:50:00.000Z	pftqg		is this the place (or can anyone suggest somewhere better) to ask questions regarding upgrading breezy to the dapper repositories? I'm stuck because initramfs-tools 0.40 won't install because my kernel is not >= 2.6.12, and kernel 2.6.15 won't install because initramfs-tools isn't >= 0.36, after issuing a apt-get dist-upgrade

2006-04-21T08:51:00.000Z	pftqg	intelikey	thanks
