2010-09-09T22:06:00.000Z	mark_		Hello everyone, Does anyone know if the Metatracker Search Tool on the Gnome Desktop in Ubuntu 10.4 will search for a string of words in a file?  I've been able to search for single words within files, but when two or more are used it results in nothing.

2010-09-09T22:07:00.000Z	dpac_	mark_	grep -ir "search words" ./
2010-09-09T22:08:00.000Z	dpac_	mark_	ohh yes.
