2005-09-27T12:09:00.000Z	NovaFlash	jamey3	i was reading along.. just wondering.. is it a linksys router?
2005-09-27T12:10:00.000Z	jamey3	NovaFlash	no, i wish it was now because you most likely have a solution... it's some cheapo taiwainese blue thing
2005-09-27T12:10:00.000Z	NovaFlash	jamey3	no, actually, i am having quite some problems with linksys routers myself which are similar to what you are experiencing.. sorry.
2005-09-27T12:10:00.000Z	jamey3	NovaFlash	ah okay, np seems both cheapo and expensive-ish routers have problems then :)
