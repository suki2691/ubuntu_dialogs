2011-04-22T07:18:00.000Z	gootdude		at least using the simple apt-get to remove evolution causes fun gnome items to be removed so you get to login to a terminal

2011-04-22T07:18:00.000Z	rww	gootdude	with the exception of that, anything with "evolution" in the name should be removable without any rocket science, if I remember correctly.
