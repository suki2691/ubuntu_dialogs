2004-10-20T08:42:00.000Z	cc		is there an rsync archive of the daily iso's? so i can just rsync the iso, rather than download a new one (saves bandwidth) ?
2004-10-20T08:43:00.000Z	Mithrandir	cc	yes, it's documented on the wiki
2004-10-20T08:43:00.000Z	cc	Mithrandir	thanks; i should pay that more attention
2004-10-20T08:43:00.000Z	Mithrandir	cc	rsync://archive.ubuntu.com::cdimage/daily/current/warty-amd64.iso , adjust for your architecture.
