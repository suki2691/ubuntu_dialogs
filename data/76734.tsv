2008-12-31T10:00:00.000Z	|thunder		Hi all, I have a webcam and a tv capture card, both of which can be used as the video source in web based flash player (as for youtube, justin.tv, etc...). Is it possible have a video player work in the same way ? as in, use mplayer or vlc etc. to be the source for the flash based video capture?
