2009-03-01T03:32:00.000Z	stefano		hi. i've just performed an upgrade (some weeks after last one) of my 8.10 on my acer aspire one.It worked, but now when I maximize a window in gnome, the the upper part disappear. the title bar does not exist anymore, as well as the buttons for maximizing, minimizing, etc. Same thing happen with xfce. how could i solve?

2009-03-01T03:34:00.000Z	stefano	sprinkmeier_	i can see the upper bar of the desktop environment. just the windows lose their upper frame
2009-03-01T03:34:00.000Z	stefano	sprinkmeier_	in xfce you can see a blank space instead of the frame
