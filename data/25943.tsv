2011-01-02T14:32:00.000Z	el_seano	rickmasta	I run Ubuntu Desktop on my netbook just fine.  Maybe specify what you mean by smoothly?
2011-01-02T14:40:00.000Z	rickmasta	el_seano	I just mean, run it with no prob
2011-01-02T14:42:00.000Z	el_seano	rickmasta	To give you perspective, I have one of the earlier N270 Atom netbooks with a 1GB of RAM.  It runs Ubuntu just fine; I can even play Minecraft on this thing.
