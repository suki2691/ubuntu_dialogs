2009-04-21T01:25:00.000Z	JPZ		does ubuntu 8.10 desktop edition currently utilize dual cores properly without the need of extra packages?
2009-04-21T01:25:00.000Z	uba	JPZ	im using a HP with Athlon X2 its seems to utilize it right
2009-04-21T01:26:00.000Z	uba	JPZ	it also lists each core in the process window and i can be converting videos into ogg format at 100% on one core and browsing the web on the other
2009-04-21T01:38:00.000Z	JPZ	uba	thanks for replies. i'm currently running on a dual core as well and I see 145% CPU usage so I'm guessing that both most be working. Just wanted to make sure.
