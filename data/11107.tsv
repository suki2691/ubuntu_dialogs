I completely understand I cannot mod permissions on NTFS so how do I stop this annoying nag?
2011-08-04T12:06:00.000Z	allandee	vbgunz	do you know with which flags your ntfs partition was mounted?
2011-08-04T12:09:00.000Z	allandee	vbgunz	I don't know how to manipulate the permissions you have to alter windows partitions/disks from the GUI, look at the other suggestions
2011-08-04T12:12:00.000Z	allandee	vbgunz	can you open a terminal window and type "mount"?
