2012-08-10T11:07:00.000Z	caixa		is there anyway i can monitor what is stressing my graphics card?
2012-08-10T11:07:00.000Z	caixa		it goes from 33c to 45c randomly
2012-08-10T11:09:00.000Z	Snowie	caixa	i dont think 45c is anything to worry about
2012-08-10T11:10:00.000Z	caixa	Snowie	i know, but random 10c+ spikes arent normal for desktop use... dont have this issue in windows
