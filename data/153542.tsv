2007-10-03T15:07:00.000Z	umop-apisdn	kane77	depends on your definition of good... i know a bit of networking, as far as basics... but i'm a windows tech. how about if you ask the question, and see if anyone knows the answer?
2007-10-03T15:09:00.000Z	kane77	umop-apisdn	okay, my question is as follows.. I have wifi connection to internet. what I do is I have my computer acting as a router (set up with iptables).. Would wifi bridge help me? (I want to connect to my ISP's AP and have my own AP on the same device)
