2011-05-03T16:15:00.000Z	PeterZerneche	bullgard4	first i have to say i love gnome 2. kde and tooo xfce are also okay. but i heard noww, gnome 2 shouldnt be in 11.10. what should i do? switch to kde? gnome 3 and unity is quite okay, but not good.
2011-05-03T16:17:00.000Z	bullgard4	PeterZerneche	My advice: Stick to GNOME 2 in Natty. In Oneiron GNOME 3 will be developed very well, and Ubuntu will base much of their desktop activity on GNOME 3. So, switch to GNOME 3 in Oneiron.
