2010-01-23T03:43:00.000Z	sevenseeker		so ubuntu 9.10's and 10.4's (current) gparted does not grok my osx 10.6 hfs+ partition on an external drive, should I try a gparted livecd? (dev)
2010-01-23T03:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sevenseeker	 for many filesystms that are not linux 'standard' you need to have installed some extra support tools for gparted to properly do things with them. No idea if this is the case for HFS+
2010-01-23T03:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sevenseeker	 but it is the case for ntfs
2010-01-23T03:46:00.000Z	sevenseeker	Dr_Willis	yeah I was afraid of that, because I installed everything even remotely related to hfs available, no dice
