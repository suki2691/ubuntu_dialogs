2008-09-23T07:23:00.000Z	ivan		i'm install 8.04.1 x64 inside vmware, with XFS inside LVM, and it seems to slow to a crawl during install, during the pre-"Select and install software" phase
2008-09-23T07:23:00.000Z	ivan		is that likely to be an XFS issue?
2008-09-23T07:25:00.000Z	h4xx0r	ivan	i use xfs inside lvm pretty much every time i install ubuntu, i've not had that issue
2008-09-23T07:25:00.000Z	ivan	h4xx0r	thanks, i'll look at my broken vmware
