2007-09-14T08:17:00.000Z	davidthedrake	Zenerek	it's an EXCELLENT resource for all things Ubuntu
2007-09-14T08:19:00.000Z	Zenerek	davidthedrake	hmm i'll keep that in mind.... i prefer most forms of help as long as i don't have to look at man files...some are just...hard to follow
2007-09-14T08:19:00.000Z	davidthedrake	Zenerek	the guides there have been super-helpful in all the installations on the many computers I've done. I usually don't have to look much further than there.
