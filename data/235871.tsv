2005-05-29T13:59:00.000Z	_seth		This is pissing me off. I'm paying for a 3.5Mbps line, so why the hell am I only getting 2.79Mbps?!

2005-05-29T14:02:00.000Z	_seth	Amaranth	well I'd like to be within .2Mbps, since I'm the only person in my area with Verizon Online. I know this because my SRD was pushed back a few days because they had to put some shit into a box.
