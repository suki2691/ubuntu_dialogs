2009-10-07T01:06:00.000Z	seyfarth		Hey guys, I'm looking to get an HP netbook, which has their nonsense linux distro that blocks the CL. I want to put ubuntu on it, without buying the $100 CD drive for it. I will therefore need to install ubuntu using my local network from my windows desktop, which would act as the server. Is there a suitable guide somewhere to do this?
