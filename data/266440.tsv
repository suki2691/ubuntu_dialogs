2010-03-12T20:30:00.000Z	bulltitan		in a few words my question is if i can install the unr desktop without installing the whole thing from cd
2010-03-12T20:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bulltitan	 yes you can. I forget the meta package name however.
2010-03-12T20:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bulltitan	 you can have some quirky issues if you have gnome and 'unr desktop' both installed however
