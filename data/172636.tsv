2006-09-22T05:43:00.000Z	Keddie	Jack_Sparrow	yes, easyubuntu, but it worked after the install, just stopped one day
2006-09-22T05:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Keddie	The new easyU isnt too bad but the earlier one came back to bite a few people well after the original installation
2006-09-22T05:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Keddie	MAke a backup ..  sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list ~/sources.list.backup
