2010-02-20T21:48:00.000Z	swiftarrow		 Hi people!  I'm not a devel, but I'm trying to compile some software, and I'm getting an error.  Can someone take a look?  http://pastebin.com/d370e90f5 Thanks!
2010-02-20T21:49:00.000Z	h00k	swiftarrow	it looks like it didn't compile completely,
2010-02-20T21:50:00.000Z	h00k	swiftarrow	you may have to check with wherever this software comes from
2010-02-20T21:52:00.000Z	swiftarrow	h00k	yea... I was afeard of that.  I'm doing that too. Thought I'd try my luck.
