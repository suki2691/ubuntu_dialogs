2009-02-04T19:03:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	paranoid_ndroid	lspci | grep wire
2009-02-04T19:04:00.000Z	paranoid_ndroid	remoteCTR1	didn't show anything
2009-02-04T19:05:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	paranoid_ndroid	do only lspci then and see if you find anything with wifi or what ever in its description that reminds of a wireless card
