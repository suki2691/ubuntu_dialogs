2010-07-15T04:17:00.000Z	strangeseraph		I am having a bad time with rhythmbox
2010-07-15T04:18:00.000Z	strangeseraph		it keeps messing up me tags. I worked so hard to clean up and do all my tags, I open rhythmbox and suddenly half my tags have changed, and if I open my tag program again all the files I tagged have been screwed up
