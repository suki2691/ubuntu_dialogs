2009-03-28T02:58:00.000Z	Pointer_22	PhotoJim	Already tried, it uses the same buffer as gnome-terminal (not clipboard, but selection buffer)
2009-03-28T02:58:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Pointer_22	ok, just wanted to be sure you knew.  too bad it didn't work.
2009-03-28T03:01:00.000Z	Pointer_22	PhotoJim	Thanks for checking, I feel I will have to switch to this selection buffer idiology, as I see everthing I select in any other program, get into selection buffer and then with shift+insert can be pasted into terminal
