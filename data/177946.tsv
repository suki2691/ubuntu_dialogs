2007-07-11T09:05:00.000Z	Dashmi		I can't get my 2 gig Sd card to fill up to capacity, it stops at roughly half full and won't accept any more files... what's up with that?

2007-07-11T09:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dashmi	what does gparted say about the flash drive
2007-07-11T09:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dashmi	have you deleted many files on that flash drive that may equal what you now cannot access?
