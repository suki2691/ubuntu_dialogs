2012-02-08T21:36:00.000Z	no_gravity		Good Evening from Germany! Today I booted into my ubuntu partition and Ubuntu updated Grub. Now when I boot, my encrypted Debian partition is gone. Well, its still there, but when I boot it, it doesnt ask for a password to decrypt the encrypted partition but instead initialises the debian on the boot partition itself. Did I describe that in an understandable way? I wonder how to get back my encrypted debian system now.

2012-02-08T21:39:00.000Z	no_gravity	bananenkampf-de	well, obviously on the partition that my encrypted debian partition uses as /boot there also is a whole debian installation. And that one boots now.
