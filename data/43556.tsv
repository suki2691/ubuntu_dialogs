2012-03-02T00:33:00.000Z	Mike9863	Zal	Well I see that it ran sudo apt-get dist-upgrade. Is that what would install all those packages?
2012-03-02T00:34:00.000Z	Zal	Mike9863	no, upgrade won't typically install a bunch of new packages as far as I know. The *next* command installs new stuff though
2012-03-02T00:36:00.000Z	Mike9863	Zal	I'm guessing the ubuntu-desktop package is the one that comes with all the packages. If I were to remove ubuntu-desktop would it revert to what I had previously or would it remove essential things as well?
