2011-07-29T09:48:00.000Z	Darksmurf		Does it seem crazy that an OS who's roots started as a multi user OS (timesharing, etc), is now primarly a single user OS?
2011-07-29T09:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	Darksmurf	 i dont use it as a primary single user...
2011-07-29T09:54:00.000Z	Darksmurf	dr_willis	These systems that have insane amounts of (CPU) power, massive amounts of memory, mostly just sitting and reading and writing to a TCP socket, doing a little video processing, etc - SO much more powerful than the timeshare systems of yesteryear... I'll be quiet now. Wow booting from USB is slow..
