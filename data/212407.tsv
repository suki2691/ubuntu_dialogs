2007-09-25T13:50:00.000Z	Syrra		I begin to loathe kernel updates. Grub is  now llooking in the wrong place for the root partition and I don't remember what hard drive/partition it's in.

2007-09-25T13:53:00.000Z	Syrra	anthony	Which option is that then?
2007-09-25T13:54:00.000Z	anthony	Syrra	groot I think
