2008-03-28T05:33:00.000Z	bazhang	spork969	using iTunes; you can ask in ##apple about that
2008-03-28T05:34:00.000Z	spork969	bazhang	im running ubuntu, itunes won't install on ubuntu
2008-03-28T05:35:00.000Z	bazhang	spork969	then either wait for a linux port of iTunes or find some other way; currently that is the only one
