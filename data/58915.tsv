2009-12-08T09:04:00.000Z	tehdave		Alright...important question: I've been running 8.04 for a while, and have it set up pretty much exactly how I want it. Only issue I'm having is Sound sometimes goes completely Bonkers, and I keep forgetting to write down what I do to fix it, expecting it to stay fixed (It Doesn't). Tired of this, I'm thinking of upgrading to 9.10. Would it be better to just backup /home and do a fresh install? or is it possible to upgrade through 8
