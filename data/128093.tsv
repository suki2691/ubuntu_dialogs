2010-11-09T19:04:00.000Z	joe85		how do I know if I am running 32bit or 64bit ubuntu?
2010-11-09T19:04:00.000Z	mbeierl	joe85	uname -a from a terminal will tell you
2010-11-09T19:05:00.000Z	mbeierl	joe85	if it says "x86_64" near the end of the line, it's a 64 bit kernel
2010-11-09T19:06:00.000Z	mbeierl	joe85	then your kernel is 32
