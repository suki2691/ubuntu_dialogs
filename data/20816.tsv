2011-09-17T00:46:00.000Z	leeping		Hi there - is there any way to run "updatedb" just for myself, not as "root" ?
2011-09-17T00:47:00.000Z	leeping		I'm just trying to locate some files on the filesystem but I'm not "root" so I can't run "updatedb" :(
2011-09-17T00:48:00.000Z	BarkingFish	leeping	- sudo updatedb will do the job for you
2011-09-17T00:50:00.000Z	leeping	BarkingFish	I can't do sudo.
