2006-10-14T10:58:00.000Z	Random_Transit		hey, quick question...is there any way for me to reinstall windows on one drive and not have it screw with GRUB?
2006-10-14T10:59:00.000Z	lupine_85	Random_Transit	if it's a separate physical drive, then yes
2006-10-14T10:59:00.000Z	Random_Transit	lupine_85	it is a separate drive
2006-10-14T11:02:00.000Z	Random_Transit	lupine_85	so it won't look for the first drive on the IDE channel and wipe it's MBR?
