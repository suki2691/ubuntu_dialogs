2009-07-23T05:42:00.000Z	CapaH		Ok let me explain what I am trying to do. I want to create an ip address on *this* machine - like 192.168.1.12 or 10.0.4.1 or whatever -- I want it to be so that anything sent to *that* ip address, on port 22 --- goes to a different ip address, on port 99 --- how can I do that?
2009-07-23T05:43:00.000Z	CapaH		in this way I can ssh to blah@10.0.4.1 instead of ssh to blah@_other_ip -p 99   -- removes the need to specify port
2009-07-23T05:44:00.000Z	CapaH		... of course
