2007-07-26T09:12:00.000Z	PleaseHelpUbuntu		Hi, I just received my 500gb external usb hard drive and I do not know how to get it to work.  ubuntu recognizes it but i cannot move files to it to store, does the hard drive need to be formated, would anyone be willing to give me some help...thank you

2007-07-26T09:16:00.000Z	riotkittie	PleaseHelpUbuntu	what do you want to do with the drive? strictly Linux? share data between Linux and Win?
