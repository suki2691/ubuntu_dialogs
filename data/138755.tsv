2009-03-17T12:37:00.000Z	spc	koshari	yes it works.. however i'm new to ubuntu and i want to run it headless (vnc when needed) and wireless however to get the wireless started i have to logon to the desktop and it starts automatically
2009-03-17T12:38:00.000Z	spc	koshari	I'm very new.. hell this is the first time i've been on irc in 10 years
2009-03-17T12:39:00.000Z	spc	koshari	i also want to keep the same ip address.. (which is easy when i;m wired to my router)
