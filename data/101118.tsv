2008-07-04T21:52:00.000Z	MGrunde		If anyone could look at my xorg.conf, I'd really appreciate it.  Ubuntu doesn't like it, but I'm not sure what I've done wrong.  It's at http://pastebin.com/d233cc1fe

2008-07-04T21:55:00.000Z	MGrunde	wigren	sure, or a different testing program, whatever you prefer
2008-07-04T21:56:00.000Z	wigren	MGrunde	ok, thanks for the help
