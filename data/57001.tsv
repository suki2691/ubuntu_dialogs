2009-05-18T23:18:00.000Z	Absolute01		Sometimes when I restart my machine I get a busy box error saying that the root hard drive is not found, So i need to restart a couple of times for it to work. I have tried switching from UUID notation to direct /dev/sda1 but that didnt help.
2009-05-18T23:18:00.000Z	Absolute01		any fixes?
