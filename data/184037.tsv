2006-06-06T08:19:00.000Z	Keigo-kun		Is there any good program like mIRC for Ubuntu? I tried to compile xchat, but it just won't work, no matter how many packages I download

2006-06-06T08:21:00.000Z	jameyg	Keigo-kun	so sudo apt-get install xchat
2006-06-06T08:21:00.000Z	jameyg	Keigo-kun	apt-get install build-essential
