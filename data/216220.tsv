2006-08-15T09:21:00.000Z	siratik000		I'm trying to figure out what group apache2 is running on, and I know its www-data , but what is the group?
2006-08-15T09:21:00.000Z	siratik000		so just "groups"
2006-08-15T09:22:00.000Z	DShepherd	siratik000	you mean users logged in now? or users that have ever logged onto the system?
