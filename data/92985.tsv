2008-05-05T19:09:00.000Z	nemo		Hey. I'd like to find out if a friend's computer is still on hardy pre-stable release.
2008-05-05T19:10:00.000Z	nemo		Is there a way to find out? they aren't sure they ran the update tool
2008-05-05T19:10:00.000Z	k20a	nemo	update manager would send request a to install the newest release if they are still on rc
2008-05-05T19:10:00.000Z	nemo	k20a	I'd think so too, unless something... went wrong...
