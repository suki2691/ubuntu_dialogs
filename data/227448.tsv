2010-09-08T04:00:00.000Z	jaybee		Is there an easy way to get rid of all the unnecesary processes in ubuntu? I've noticed it has a ton or stuff that I can't see a need for, ie xfs,jfs, etc....
2010-09-08T04:00:00.000Z	jaybee		I think it may be the kernel loading all of this stuff, rcconf isn't the thing...
2010-09-08T04:01:00.000Z	jaybee		This is ubuntu server, so having * hardware support is quite a nuisance
2010-09-08T04:01:00.000Z	test34	jaybee	xfs process? do you mean package?
