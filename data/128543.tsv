2009-06-04T09:20:00.000Z	david__		I'm trying to customize my new 9.04 install. I went to gnome-look and i cant figure out if i should choose between gtk 1.x, gtk 2.x, metacity, compiz or eryl. any advice?
2009-06-04T09:22:00.000Z	hx	david__	latest gtk will customized buttons and other stuff like forms. Metacity is the main window manager of ubuntu, so that will customized borders , etc. If you have emerald installed then you may go for the compiz section...
2009-06-04T09:22:00.000Z	david__	hx	so in a fresh ubuntu install i should choose metacity. is emerald worth the install?
