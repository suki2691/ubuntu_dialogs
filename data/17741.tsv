2011-03-12T12:21:00.000Z	jmwpc		I'm stuck on a bash scripting problem. If I want to get the path portion of a file name into a variable (i.e. /home/myuser/music/somesong.mp3), how to do I get just the path?
2011-03-12T12:22:00.000Z	dr_Willis	jmwpc	i recall there nbeing some commands in bash that do that.. the advanced bash scripting guide may give examples. Ive no tdone that task in ages.

2011-03-12T12:23:00.000Z	jmwpc	dr_Willis	I'll check that out... thanks
