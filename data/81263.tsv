2008-09-28T05:52:00.000Z	DanielMatt		what is the terminal command to see ip address and such? (similar to windows ipconfig?)
2008-09-28T05:52:00.000Z	DanielMatt		cool, thanks
2008-09-28T05:52:00.000Z	thearthur	DanielMatt	ifconfig or "ip -4 addr"
2008-09-28T05:52:00.000Z	thearthur	DanielMatt	 the second is more "user frendly"
