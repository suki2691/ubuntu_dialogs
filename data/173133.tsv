2006-12-12T14:38:00.000Z	fallingdutch		i upgraded from 6.06 to 6.10 yesterday, rebooted and when i wanted to login X crashed - the error seemed to be in /etc/bash_completion i have uncommented the lines in .bashrc then the x-session didn't crash. Now i start an app and X crashes again, but ran before.is there a known problem with /etc/bash_completion and any ideas why x crashes when starting the app, what changed between 6.10 and 6.06?
