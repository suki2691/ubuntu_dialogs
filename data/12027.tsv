2011-08-01T07:36:00.000Z	Guest87172		I'd like to set up my desktop to run win7 on ssd/and a 500gb for storage, with another 500 for ubuntu
2011-08-01T07:37:00.000Z	Guest87172		pretty simple, right? I imagine I just format the extra hdd
2011-08-01T07:37:00.000Z	Guest87172		then install ubuntu over the top
2011-08-01T07:37:00.000Z	DangerOnTheRangr	Guest87172	Make sure to install Windows first - Windows has a notorious record of erasing the MBR
