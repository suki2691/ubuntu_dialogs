2006-08-30T07:39:00.000Z	cyfr		Hi can anyone tell me how to COMPLETLY remove XGL and then install xorg back again so that I can install and play games with cedega?
2006-08-30T07:39:00.000Z	longwave	cyfr	that kind of depends on how you installed xgl in the first place, which set of instructions did you follow?
2006-08-30T07:40:00.000Z	cyfr	longwave	im not sure :p basicly added a repo and did an apt-get i think
2006-08-30T07:44:00.000Z	longwave	cyfr	maybe asking in #ubuntu-xgl will get you better answers, though
