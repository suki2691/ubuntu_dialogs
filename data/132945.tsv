2008-11-12T20:43:00.000Z	nikitis		Question: I'm using pulseaudio and i've noticed that everything works great but after like an hour or two, or sometimes when I load 3 or more sound programs all audio stops.  Anyone have this issue or know why?
2008-11-12T20:44:00.000Z	limecat	nikitis	may be helpful to look @ the output from running "dmesg" in a console--but i probably wouldnt be able to help you further than that
2008-11-12T20:46:00.000Z	nikitis	limecat	just looked, but I see nothing
2008-11-12T20:47:00.000Z	limecat	nikitis	i wouldnt be able to help on this, but sometimes dmesg gives useful stuff to google.  Sorry :(
