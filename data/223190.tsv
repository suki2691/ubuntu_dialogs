2005-10-06T08:38:00.000Z	atripathi		while fixing my display I deleted xorg files ........ still my display is running on lower resolution as earlier. I thought that either X will crash or regenerate xorg files but none happened
2005-10-06T08:39:00.000Z	atripathi		is there any way to get the xorg.conf files again ?
2005-10-06T08:39:00.000Z	durt	atripathi	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-10-06T08:41:00.000Z	durt	atripathi	then answer the questions differently
