2008-11-17T09:07:00.000Z	newubuntuuser		hello i was wondering y i cant access my windows partition thru the GRUB boot loader?
2008-11-17T09:07:00.000Z	newubuntuuser		is there a way to make it so my second HD and my ubuntu hd show up on the same boot loader?
2008-11-17T09:08:00.000Z	newubuntuuser		so i cant have the option to boot from either or?
2008-11-17T09:08:00.000Z	histo	newubuntuuser	because the entries are not in the grub menu.
