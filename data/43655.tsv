2009-11-05T03:16:00.000Z	jxjl		good evening, I'm trying to install kubuntu 9.10, but installer shows me my 2 80 GB disks (with prepared ext3 and swap filesystems) as a raid without any filesystems, but it isn't raid, is there any way, how to disable raid functionality in installer, to allow me to install kubuntu on my disks? (I'm using the first one for / and second for home, but there are also another filesystems)

2009-11-05T03:22:00.000Z	jxjl	mMezquitale	two SATA disks connected to disk controller om motherboard (ASUS M2A-VM), It has a possibility to make a hardware RAID, but it is disabled in BIOS I have successfully installed any previous versions of ubuntu but now there is that problem
