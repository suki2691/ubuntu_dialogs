2007-11-22T06:09:00.000Z	distatica		I just installed my nvidia drivers (geforce3 ti200) using the Restrited drivers manager and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia, and everything looks a LOT nicer than before. Except, now when I open a terminal window its' all white, there's no text, nothing. I can tell it's working because I can right click and get the terminal context menu. Any thoughts?

2007-11-22T06:21:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula|lapp	distatica	not a problem... I think
