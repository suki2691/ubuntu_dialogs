2007-05-06T05:28:00.000Z	Drk_guy	d2812	have you tried porting it with Wine
2007-05-06T05:29:00.000Z	d2812	Drk_guy	not yet, was just seeing if anyone knew of an equiv. i'll give it a shot
2007-05-06T05:40:00.000Z	d2812	Drk_guy	just to let you know, the VB6 runtimes install fine, but MPE fails. I'll play with it tomorrow and see if I get anymore luck.
