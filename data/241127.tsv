2007-08-05T06:05:00.000Z	regeya		I'm all for educating people on the dangers of root, but 'notoor' is not a threat to anyone...one of the idents I had that got me booted :-)  I was told I was flamebating

2007-08-05T06:07:00.000Z	regeya	penguin42	to be fair, I was...sorta...but it wasn't toward anyone in #debian.  they had a bot that would do ALLCAPS ANNOUNCEMENTS called the_raven that'd go frickin' nuts when someone was *root* or *toor* (yeah, those are wildcards, not just emphasis)
