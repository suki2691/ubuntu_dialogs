2012-01-18T01:24:00.000Z	jason_		Hi there. Quick question. If I were to use a vga splitter (one cable, pigtail ends, DVI out, two VGA's in) would I be able to effectively get "dual monitors" running on my Nvidia graphics card despite the fact my card would only have 1 port?

2012-01-18T01:25:00.000Z	jason_	aeon-ltd	my thought process is to get triple monitors... I have two DVI ports on my card... so I began to wonder 1 DVI to 1 DVI monitor (main) and two VGAs off of a VGA splitter for the side monitors.
