2010-05-18T14:30:00.000Z	melrokz		Hi. In Lucid, I'll have to double-click twice to open an NTFS drive, that I automounted using /etc/fstab. Double-clicking it once should open it, right?
2010-05-18T14:31:00.000Z	lapion	melrokz	depends on what options you set in fstab
2010-05-18T14:37:00.000Z	lapion	melrokz	most probably..
2010-05-18T14:40:00.000Z	lapion	melrokz	I have sometime ago stopped using  ntfs in favor of ext4fs.. main reason: speed, secondary reason, fsck for ntfs can get so complicated that not even windows chkdsk can fix ntfs, and I have had to run ntfs-fsck multiple times before chkdsk would even do anything,.. I had to dump all data and redownload
