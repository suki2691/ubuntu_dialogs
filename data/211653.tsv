2006-11-22T07:53:00.000Z	JackHanna		I've searched all over the forum and can't find answer. The lcd switch is not being recognized on my HP laptop. Everything else works though
2006-11-22T07:55:00.000Z	JackHanna		anyone think of better search words, lid switch, lcd switch...
2006-11-22T07:55:00.000Z	JackHanna		suspend works but the close lid switch isn't
2006-11-22T07:55:00.000Z	sn9	JackHanna	is it an older or newer hp?
