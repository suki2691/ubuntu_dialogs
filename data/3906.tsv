2012-04-23T00:12:00.000Z	amandasue75		I'm trying to fire up x11vnc remotely (I did an ssh -XC into the server) and it's not going well.  What's the best way to see an dinteract with what's currently showing on the server's screen?  I need exercise, but don't want to keep trucking up and down the stairs.
