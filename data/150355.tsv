2009-08-11T23:28:00.000Z	ScottG		Could someone explain to me how I install custom themes? I have just found guides saying "drag the theme into the Appearance Properties window" but I don't have any theme file to drag.
2009-08-11T23:28:00.000Z	Pici	ScottG	Well, what theme are you trying to install and where did you get it?
2009-08-11T23:28:00.000Z	Pici	ScottG	Or rather, what file do you have?
2009-09-17T20:55:00.000Z	Pici	ScottG	Or ask in #bash, its more on-topic there.
