2009-01-18T23:04:00.000Z	sketch2002	rgnr	is that one of the ones with SLI? might need to use the BusID in the Device section, lspci will give you a list of pci's so you can find one of the ones for the card and use that
2009-01-18T23:04:00.000Z	sketch2002	rgnr	man xorg.conf gives a bit of explanation about BusID
