2011-09-17T23:59:00.000Z	BrandonBolton	escott	so it would be a lot of hard work probably is what you are saying. Thank you, I was just curious.
2011-09-18T00:00:00.000Z	escott	BrandonBolton	it may not be work at all. I would look into how nautilus plugins work. If they don't need to be built in at compile time it should be easy
2011-09-18T00:01:00.000Z	BrandonBolton	escott	Okay, I shall google it now. Thank you.
