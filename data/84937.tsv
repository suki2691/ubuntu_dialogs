2011-05-06T17:14:00.000Z	nibbler_	erix	i'm working with linux for >10 years now, but for this i always have to use the manpage before using ;-)
2011-05-06T17:17:00.000Z	nibbler_	erix	for this just use a2ensite and a2dissit
2011-05-06T17:17:00.000Z	nibbler_	erix	i dont think this does any more then creating the symlink for you, so do as you wish :)
