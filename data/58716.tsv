2010-06-23T06:41:00.000Z	vaul	Jordan_U	Actually, I never tried that myself, but I read a lot of positive responses about that thing.

That means that 1: There is a problem somewhere that has made his situation worse, that needs to be fixed 2: Trying to work around the root cause by getting slightly better general performance with BFS will not make up for the difference.
