2006-08-30T06:12:00.000Z	OmegaNine		Does kubuntu barrow from ubuntu?  I like KDE, but Ubuntu is so well thought out, i dont wannt jump ship.
2006-08-30T06:12:00.000Z	W_McL	OmegaNine	kubuntu = ubuntu with kde as default gui
2006-08-30T06:13:00.000Z	W_McL	OmegaNine	and xubuntu = ubuntu with xfce as default gui
2006-08-30T06:13:00.000Z	W_McL	OmegaNine	it's just a matter of the gui installed by default
