2007-05-10T09:14:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	finer_recliner	type "ifconfig". The one which has a device name beginning with "eth" is your ethernet.
2007-05-10T09:15:00.000Z	finer_recliner	SlimeyPete	yes i know, but both wifi and ethnernet port begin with eth (eth0, eth1)
2007-05-10T09:15:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	finer_recliner	oh... dunno then ;)
