2007-05-04T11:33:00.000Z	fsckit		can someone tell me if a game/full screen app isn't responding, is there a way to change priority to my task manager or kill it somehow like in windows?
2007-05-04T11:34:00.000Z	fsckit		anyone?
2007-05-04T11:35:00.000Z	fsckit		can someone tell my why my xorg is using nvidia drivers but my kde video setting says i'm using nv?
2007-05-04T11:37:00.000Z	eck	fsckit	because you probably are using nv, check your Xorg logs to see what driver it actually used
