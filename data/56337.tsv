2009-11-01T10:04:00.000Z	Omen20		Oh I meant to say I have a huge problem
2009-11-01T10:06:00.000Z	Omen20		I have installed 4 times now. 1st time was 64bit RC, second time was 64bit again off the torrent, 3rd off the download server, just now I switched to 32bit from the torrent. All have a problem at the very end of install with removing a package which causes some huge problem when I reboot.
2009-11-01T10:07:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Omen20	what package, why is it being removed?
