2009-05-16T03:53:00.000Z	NeutroN--		hello guys, has anyone here used ubuntu with the Radeon HD 4830 512MB video card? I have a problem that when I boot ubuntu, the screen goes totally pixelated and unreadable. It worked with the default drivers, however those drivers weren't good for games, so I went and added ATI catalyst control center to see if that would solve the problem, but once I rebooted it became that way, :\
2009-05-16T03:53:00.000Z	NeutroN--		so my question is, how do I get rid of the stuff I installed from the shell?
