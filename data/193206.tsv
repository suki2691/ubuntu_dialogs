2007-04-25T10:45:00.000Z	Kassah		is there a way to turn off the pretty boot screen temporarily and see what's going on during boot up?
2007-04-25T10:47:00.000Z	asc	Kassah	When you get to the grub screen, press esc.  Select the appropriate kernel, and press e.  Remove the words 'splash' and 'quiet', then press enter, then press b.  It won't save the changes.
