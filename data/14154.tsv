2011-05-19T04:08:00.000Z	crogeek_on_ubunt		does ANYONE know how to disable vsync?
2011-05-19T04:09:00.000Z	szal	crogeek_on_ubunt	what do you mean by that?
2011-05-19T04:13:00.000Z	szal	crogeek_on_ubunt	again, my perception is that fps in a game has nothing to do w/ sync rate of a displaying device
2011-05-19T04:21:00.000Z	crogeek_on_ubunt	szal	fine just give me solution how turn off vsync which is locking my QL to 60 fps
