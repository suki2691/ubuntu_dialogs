2011-02-01T23:25:00.000Z	matju	maco	well, i was asking because i found a web post that claimed that switching from SuSE to Ubuntu reduced the number of available resolutions. why would any resolutions be missing from the menu ? (i don't have proof of what my laptop can do : i ran SuSE long ago too, but i have no recollection of resolution list)
