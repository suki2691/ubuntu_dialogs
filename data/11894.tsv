2012-03-01T16:26:00.000Z	shawny		Hoping somone can point me in the right direction here,  I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 desktop, every time I try to do a VNC to my computer, I can see my desktop, but it never refreshes.  If I open up anything from VNC nothing happens, but if I go to the actual computer, whatever I clicked has been opened.  Can anyone tell me where I might look to fix this?
