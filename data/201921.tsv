2007-02-14T08:34:00.000Z	tanascar		Is there a list somewhere that I can search for a specific kernel file and it will tell me what package it is in?
2007-02-14T08:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	tanascar	the file is in the kernel package sudo aptitude install linux-image-generic
2007-02-14T08:36:00.000Z	IdleOne	tanascar	then download the linux-image-generic package and intall it to the machine that nees it
