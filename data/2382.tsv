2012-08-08T21:57:00.000Z	Aaton		is there a way to list out the licenses of all the installed packages I've installed?
2012-08-08T21:57:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Aaton	 they are all GPL
2012-08-08T22:21:00.000Z	Aaton	MonkeyDust	with 12.04 hasn't some  AGPL licensed software been included in the official release?  I know there is more than just GPL installed, BSD, Apache, LGPL...
2012-08-08T22:21:00.000Z	Aaton	MonkeyDust	just do this to see: find /usr/share/doc/ -name copyright -exec licensecheck {} \;
