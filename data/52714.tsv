2009-07-12T05:55:00.000Z	wfiuewfew		Hi! I need to connect and remotely view the desktop of my machine. I know vnc can do this. but the problem is that my machine is in a physically insecure location, and with vnc anyone would be able to plug in a display, since I need to be logged in while using vnc. Are there better options?
