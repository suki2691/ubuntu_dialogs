2009-04-27T07:12:00.000Z	jander99	daftykins	I dist-upgraded from intrepid but have had no issues with vmware 6.5.0. vmware tools for windows installs just fine.  I do have some audio issues but its related to pulseaudio and flash not giving up control of the sound card, so /dev/dsp can't be attached to the vm.
