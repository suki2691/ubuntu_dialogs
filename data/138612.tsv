2007-06-30T13:54:00.000Z	bjv		what is the best way to get a list of last-made changes to installed packages?
2007-06-30T13:55:00.000Z	magnetron	bjv	you could pull out the log in Synaptic
2007-06-30T13:55:00.000Z	bjv	magnetron	i did not make the changes with synaptic, however
2007-06-30T13:56:00.000Z	magnetron	bjv	i am not sure, but try it. it's the only option i know of
