2009-04-10T06:40:00.000Z	fbc-mx		Is there anything that will allow you to prioritize your bandwidth use by port or application??

2009-04-10T06:44:00.000Z	fbc-mx	Cpudan80	 unfortunately I do not control my router... I wanted something that would give my mail traffic priority, over my bittorent. Instead of limiting my bandwidth on my torrent software which is not effecient managment fo my bandwidth.
