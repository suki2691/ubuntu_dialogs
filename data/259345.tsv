2004-12-05T09:58:00.000Z	regeya		well, now, did I say that? :-D  all I'm saying is that if someone asked for a good web browser and (this is hypothetical because it doesn't work well) if I were to say "install IE using Wine" people would be all over me.  I see very little righteous indignation over filesharing compared to Free Software zealots. :-D  Note that I prefer Free Software over alternatives and use Free everywhere I can.
