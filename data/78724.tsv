2008-12-03T13:08:00.000Z	furythor1		Problem : My screen gets jinxed resolution of 640x480 after I installed proprietary nvidia drivers. How to change resolution. I did already try applet in system>preferences>screen resolution
2008-12-03T13:08:00.000Z	FAJ	furythor1	install nvidia-settings.
2008-12-03T13:10:00.000Z	FAJ	furythor1	no nvidia-settings
2008-12-03T13:20:00.000Z	FAJ	furythor1	 nvidia-settings, really helps,  if it's an viewsonic monitor try removing xserver-xgl.
