2005-09-26T09:36:00.000Z	scoove		?: why ubuntu vs. unstable debian? i've read distrowatch review and don't quite like gnome's instability. clean, concise installs are desirable. how is ubuntu's stability?
2005-09-26T09:36:00.000Z	scoove		steven: if ubuntu like most *nix's, rc.local can run local script
2005-09-26T09:37:00.000Z	scoove		yikes... another distro to learn. sigh
2005-09-26T09:37:00.000Z	steven_	scoove	should i just put my script in rc.local folder?
