2006-06-16T08:18:00.000Z	MilesAttacca		Is QtParted included on the server-install Dapper Drake ISO?
2006-06-16T08:19:00.000Z	bimberi	MilesAttacca	the server install won't have any gui apps (such as qtparted)
2006-06-16T08:19:00.000Z	bimberi	MilesAttacca	because servers generally don't run GUIs
2006-06-16T08:22:00.000Z	bimberi	MilesAttacca	you can do a server install and then install the gui components later.  Still a large download but smaller than another ISO
