2006-10-09T07:59:00.000Z	pluto		Last night I installed the KDE desktop, and since the install my login screen is over sized.  If I run dpkg reconfigure xserver-xorg, will this solve my problem?

2006-10-09T08:00:00.000Z	kmaynard		without having to reconfigre...but, it is an option and it will work
2006-10-09T08:01:00.000Z	pluto	kmaynard	are you speaking of the default for the login screen, or the gui session?
