2011-07-16T20:35:00.000Z	Jemt		Hello guys. I want to dual boot on a Mac Book Pro. Will I need to install OSX first, or can I install Ubuntu and later OSX ?
2011-07-16T20:37:00.000Z	io	Jemt	depends if you want to play with Ubuntu or OS X first
2011-07-16T20:37:00.000Z	Jemt	io	Ubuntu first. But I'm not sure whether the OSX installer will wipe my entire drive
2011-07-16T20:37:00.000Z	io	Jemt	it won't
