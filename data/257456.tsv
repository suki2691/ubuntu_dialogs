2011-01-10T14:27:00.000Z	Prinny		I was wondering if someone here could help me out with a bit of an issue. I'm not entirely sure how to proceed with getting my sound to work on a laptop. It's a rather fresh install of Ubuntu and I've been digging through the "Debugging Sound Problems" page, but I haven't had any luck.

2011-01-10T14:29:00.000Z	sugoruyo	Prinny	that's quite an old "tradition" from the time when RAM usually was somewhere between 256-768 MB
