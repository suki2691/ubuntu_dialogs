2010-01-22T02:58:00.000Z	James147	Halabund	I think it means when you have an connection it will auto conntect tothe vpn
2010-01-22T02:58:00.000Z	Halabund	James147	I would expect the same, except that it doesn't connect automatically, and I have no idea why...
2010-01-22T02:59:00.000Z	James147	Halabund	Could be a bug?
