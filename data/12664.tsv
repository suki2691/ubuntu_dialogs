If I switch to KDE, how will most of the progs I'm used to running (Rhythmbox, Libre Office, Firefox, etc.) be affected, if at all?

I'm used to Alt+Tab switching between all open windows, not programs. I hate that if I have two terminals open to switch between them I have to Alt+Tab to the terminal, wait for it to show the others, then switch.
