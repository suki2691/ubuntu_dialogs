2007-12-20T08:38:00.000Z	ademan		anyone know what the "best" way to reliably transfer files between a windows and linux machine would be?  i'd love to use rsync but I can't find a source for a win32 rsync that i trust, although i could give a couple a try i suppose
2007-12-20T08:38:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	ademan	on a home network? i use samba
2007-12-20T08:39:00.000Z	ademan	corruptionoflulz	normally I would, but samba has corrupted files before for me, so i don't trust it much :-/
2007-12-20T08:39:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	ademan	then i suppose the easiest and safest would probably be FTP
