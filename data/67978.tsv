2010-08-03T19:57:00.000Z	gartral	blip-	generally.. never.. they update with new release of ubuntu
2010-08-03T19:58:00.000Z	blip-	gartral	ooh I see.   would've thought mail client classifies as important security updates
2010-08-03T19:58:00.000Z	gartral	blip-	only when theres an important security fix do they update in repos
