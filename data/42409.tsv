2011-05-20T05:15:00.000Z	lfaraone		I have a Pentium4@3.0Ghz with 512MiB of RAM. I'm prepping the computer for donation. Should I install Xubuntu, or is that enough to handle normal Ubuntu? (I'd go with 10.04 LTS)
2011-05-20T05:17:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	lfaraone	i've used regular ubuntu fine, on the same spec pc albeit with no gpu and a ide hdd. though if the new owner isn't going to wipe it anyway i'd put xubuntu on for more mileage
2011-05-20T05:18:00.000Z	lfaraone	aeon-ltd	fair enough. I'll do an OEM install of Ubuntu and see how it runs, and if it sucks majorly I'll replace with Xubuntu
2011-05-20T05:19:00.000Z	lfaraone	aeon-ltd	the partitioner should put sufficient swap automatically, right?
