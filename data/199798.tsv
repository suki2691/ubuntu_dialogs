CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE will kill your xsession and all child threads (firefox, session managers, etc.) and might cause serious problems to programms which need to cleanup (ie. release lock files, clean files in tem, close connections propperly, etc.) use $ sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart (or kdm/xdm) instead!
