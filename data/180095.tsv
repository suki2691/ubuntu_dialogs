2010-05-18T13:56:00.000Z	bicyclerepairman		I've just booted up 10.04, you know the latest LTS, but when X starts up it gets the resolution wrong and becomes unusable (I have some weird hardware).
2010-05-18T13:56:00.000Z	bicyclerepairman		is there a way to disable it?
2010-05-18T13:56:00.000Z	jrib	bicyclerepairman	what video card do you have?
2010-05-18T13:56:00.000Z	jrib	bicyclerepairman	do you have any drivers offered to you in System -> Administration -> Hardware drivers?
