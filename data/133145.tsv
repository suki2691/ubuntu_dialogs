2007-05-26T07:38:00.000Z	pietro10	ctothej	Look in the Sound preferences
2007-05-26T07:39:00.000Z	ctothej	pietro10	my usb sound was working correctly until a few days ago. now it is not even listed there.
2007-05-26T07:39:00.000Z	ctothej	pietro10	i think it happened when i plugged another usb device into its usb hub.
