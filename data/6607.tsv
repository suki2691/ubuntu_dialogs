2012-01-05T21:20:00.000Z	xyz111	DoctorD	thanks. I'm trying to configure my own name server, however when I follow the instructions at (http://ulyssesonline.com/2007/11/07/how-to-setup-a-dns-server-in-ubuntu/) and restart, I simply get a fail for the restart but no explanation as to what caused the fail! Could someone tell me where the log files, if any, for bind are located?! Thanks
2012-01-05T21:21:00.000Z	DoctorD	xyz111	did you tryied a restart of the ubuntu ?
