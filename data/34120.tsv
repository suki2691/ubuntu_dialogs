2010-04-16T18:55:00.000Z	user123		I have an external mybook 500gb hdd which I use to store my data. I just plugged it in ubuntu, and a message appeared: "one or more disks are failing" and there is a red message "disk failure is imminent" What can I do?

2010-04-16T18:56:00.000Z	user123	erUSUL	ok, I think that is quite obvious but then my question would be: Can I reformat or do something to fix that hdd?
2010-04-16T18:57:00.000Z	tenmiles	user123	no, it needs to be replaced by the company
