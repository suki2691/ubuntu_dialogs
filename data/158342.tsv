2009-03-28T13:33:00.000Z	bobbb		why should I use ubuntu over fedora?
2009-03-28T13:33:00.000Z	Slart	bobbb	not really sure there are any major differences.. there's apt vs rpm
2009-03-28T13:35:00.000Z	Slart	bobbb	try a live cd of each.. see which one you like
2009-03-28T13:36:00.000Z	Slart	bobbb	we're not ubuntu salesmen/women.. this is a support channel
