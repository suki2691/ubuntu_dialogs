2007-10-08T10:19:00.000Z	MrPink_		one quick question is there a difference between the 7.10 I can download now and the official release in two weeks or so?
2007-10-08T10:20:00.000Z	Nattgew	MrPink_	there will me updates between now and then that will be in the official release
2007-10-08T10:20:00.000Z	MrPink_		well I just thought maybe the release in two weeks only means that it isn't "officialy supported" until then and that in general the files will be the same
2007-10-08T10:20:00.000Z	MrPink_	Nattgew	ok aside from the updates between now and then (which I can update until then anyhow)
