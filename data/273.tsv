2012-11-29T03:41:00.000Z	pgib		ok guys... here is an interesting one.  When I login with lightdm, I choose English (US) as my language.  I look at my LANG envvar, it is: "en_US.UTF-8".  In firefox, the language is set to English/United-States.  Yet.. firefox and other apps insist that "Color" is not a word, and it recommends "Colour"  what the heck? any ideas?
