2010-05-22T12:38:00.000Z	themusicgod1		my keyboard (only within gnome?) is stuck in a state where it thinks its in usa but the homerow looks roughly like asdf+321, and i have to push the function key on my keyboard to get regular characters...as if the function key is 'stuck' on in gnome alone, is there any way to reset this??3+211
2010-05-22T12:38:00.000Z	themusicgod1		it works just  fine until i get into gnome in any case'
