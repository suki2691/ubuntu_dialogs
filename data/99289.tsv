2008-04-01T16:41:00.000Z	ChrisGibbs		anyone know of a kernel that supports upto 8Gb of RAM, restricted modules, 32bit 7.10 Ubuntu and is in APT???
2008-04-01T16:41:00.000Z	hischild	ChrisGibbs	it's not possible to support more then 4gb on 32bit due to address limitations.
2008-04-01T16:42:00.000Z	ChrisGibbs	hischild	It can be done with PAE turned on in the kernel
2008-04-01T16:43:00.000Z	hischild	ChrisGibbs	you seem to know what you need then.
