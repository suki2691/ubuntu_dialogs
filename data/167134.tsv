2006-09-22T14:59:00.000Z	keegan_		I installed XGL/Compiz on my computer yesterday,  I've always had checkgmail running up in my upper corner.  Everytime I get an email and I click on the delete option, it doesn't do anything.  If I switch over to Metacity I can click on it and delete it.  Anyone know way to fix this so I can use checkgmail while running Compiz
