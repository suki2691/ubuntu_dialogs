2005-03-03T15:27:00.000Z	dc17	gpierce	there was no way to "unrestrict" the ubuntu version?
2005-03-03T15:28:00.000Z	gpierce		I wouldn't have done this if only I could have had my xerox color printer working.  Xerox provided a little utility which pretty much configures cupsys.  The only problem was you had to get into admin acct.
