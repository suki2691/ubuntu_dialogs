2012-08-19T07:51:00.000Z	JoeQuery		Anyone have a suggestion?
2012-08-19T07:53:00.000Z	JoeQuery		I'm trying to diagnose a bigger problem that's preventing me from apt-get upgrade. If you could take a look at those, that would be great. https://gist.github.com/3365121 and part 2: https://gist.github.com/3390776
