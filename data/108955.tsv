2011-02-12T16:48:00.000Z	Simisu		hello everyone, i've recently bought a new external HDD and tried to install ubuntu on it, i made two partittions for it and left all the rest of the space empty (i partitioned it using the installation CD because windows didn't seem to have the option to create partitions for ubuntu) now... the installation crashed at some point and i had to unplug the computer :O(   now i wanted to try wubi
2011-02-12T16:48:00.000Z	Simisu		to install but the problem is that windows is not "seeing" the HD (even though i am able to see it with the disc admin tool, i thought to reformatt it from scratch but the tool dosen't give me the option, it's grey in the menue) what can i do next? do i need to download some formatting/partitioning tool?
