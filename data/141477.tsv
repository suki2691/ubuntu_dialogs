2007-05-21T05:04:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		I just started my system to find that my workspace switcher is nothing but a think vertical line... and if I try to adjust preferences, the names of the workspaces are not listed... any ideas?
2007-05-21T05:06:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		great - every window I open is now borderless... I did not enable or disable desktop effects... why am I experiencing this???

2007-05-21T05:07:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	SlimeyPete	I just installed this yesterday after my system was experiencing window problems...
