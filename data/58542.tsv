2010-01-19T19:16:00.000Z	scunizi	Darael	could be a plugin, theme as well..
2010-01-19T19:17:00.000Z	Darael	scunizi	I've removed (well, renamed) ~/.mozilla/firefox and would hope the plugins from the repos are stable.
2010-01-19T19:18:00.000Z	scunizi	Darael	should be.. and if you've renamed the config then if it was a plugin that should have fixed it.  Weird.. I don't now.
