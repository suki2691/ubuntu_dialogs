2007-12-06T20:39:00.000Z	thor	sudobash	nope...don't think that will work
2007-12-06T20:40:00.000Z	thor	sudobash	besides...you will never reach full i/o on your broadband connection as it is...there are almost always bottlenecks downstream
2007-12-06T20:42:00.000Z	thor	sudobash	 and how are you going to get the other end (wherever it is) to split the data into two streams addressed to two IPs?
