2005-07-25T15:04:00.000Z	Flynn_		Hi, is it advisible to download firefox from mozilla.org instead of installing it from the repositories?
2005-07-25T15:06:00.000Z	Flynn_		Thanks, crimsun. Do you suggest upgrading firefox by just 'apt-get install mozilla-firefox' in the shell?
2005-07-25T15:07:00.000Z	Flynn_		Right, but it isn't the latest version.. 1.02 and I can't install any of the extensions.
