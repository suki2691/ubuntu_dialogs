2009-03-08T22:25:00.000Z	xGeek		gentlemen too!
2009-03-08T22:27:00.000Z	xGeek		I was having problems with unetbootin and was told to 0 out my thumb drive using DD and try again. My question is what filesystem do I need to partition the thumb drive with in order for the live cd to work? ext2 or ext3 would make sense, but if memory serves me correctly it was fat16 before and worked perfectly fine. Apologies for the stupid question.
