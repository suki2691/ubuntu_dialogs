2007-10-04T11:06:00.000Z	damjan		the beryl failed to load, so I remove the support for 3d acc. for nvidia, then I reconf. the xorg with dpkg, and then I start gdm and then the cursor was on the center, then blank, then still in the center, but the screen was like have more gamma or something, so now I'm doomed to use kdm, which is slow on my pc, so what can I do to enable gdm again and use beryl?
