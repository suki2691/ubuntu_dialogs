2008-11-07T01:02:00.000Z	pangloss	paul68	probably, but the livecd method i think is easier for new users
2008-11-07T01:02:00.000Z	pangloss	paul68	all they have to do is click buttons =)
2008-11-07T01:03:00.000Z	paul68	pangloss	true I had an issue with it also and if my memory isn't failing I used reconfiguring grub and the problem was solved
