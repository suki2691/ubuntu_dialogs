2006-01-26T06:35:00.000Z	tritium	FlannelKing	did you look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
2006-01-26T06:38:00.000Z	FlannelKing	tritium	would that just be for local logins? or XDMCP as well?  Since I can log in locally, just not via cygwin/xwin
2006-01-26T06:39:00.000Z	tritium	FlannelKing	did you enable XDMCP?
