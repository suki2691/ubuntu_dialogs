2008-11-11T04:14:00.000Z	owh		Hi all, running Intrepid I am trying to get x running on two screens. Under gutsy you could just add a section to /etc/X11/xorg.conf with a ServerLayout, but that no longer exists. How do I get two independent screens again? (My screens work, but there is much dead space - their sizes are different.)
