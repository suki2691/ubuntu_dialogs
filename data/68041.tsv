2009-02-19T17:07:00.000Z	bonkit		Hi, I have enabled ufw firewall and set deny all incoming, but I can still download data from a torrent client. Shouldn't that be blocked now?
2009-02-19T17:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bonkit	did you restart the firewall after modifying the config?
2009-02-19T17:10:00.000Z	bonkit	ActionParsnip	I shouldn't have to edit iptables manually right? ufw overrides whatever settings there were?
2009-02-19T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bonkit	i'm not sure i dont use ufw
