Specifically how do i map a NFS share from a NAS so that any user on the nix box can write to the share? im guessing it is some uid, gid options under fstab. Any takers?

2012-04-29T05:01:00.000Z	wookienz	henkye	do you have different owners of the underlying FS on the storage device than the computer you are mapping to?
