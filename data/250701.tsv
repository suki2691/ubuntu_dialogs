2005-03-05T14:38:00.000Z	selinium_	stuNNed	I am on Windows at the mo... I followed the instructions, created a new profile in THunderbird (Linux) and copied the files from the old one into it. it tries to start and say it is doing stuff? and not to try and download new messages, but that is as far as it goes?
