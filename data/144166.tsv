2007-03-28T07:15:00.000Z	Belboz99		Hey all, I'm trying to use nfs to share files between two Linux PC's, one Kubuntu 6.10 one Ubuntu 7.04, I'm having trouble with permissions, anyone care to advise?
2007-03-28T07:16:00.000Z	Belboz99		mount: 192.168.0.1:fah failed, reason given by server: Permission denied
2007-03-28T07:18:00.000Z	Belboz99		how do I make a directory owned by two users?
2007-03-28T07:19:00.000Z	kripton1x	Belboz99	you can assign it the two users to the same group
