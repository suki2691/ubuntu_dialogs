2008-03-14T21:21:00.000Z	micadeyeye	skillz	hey, i get this error in var/log/apache2/error.log "sh: mkfifo: Permission denied". the php script has this code "@system("mkfifo -m 666 ".$config->reply_fifo_path );" how can i fix this? i think my apache doesn't have the permission to run that code. seems i need to do something like chown www-data somewhere??????
