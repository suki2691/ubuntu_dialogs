2009-10-28T11:05:00.000Z	steven_		I have a problem.  When trying to install Xubuntu in Virtualbox for 64-bit I get the following message:  This kernel requires an x86-64 CPU, but only detected an i686 CPU.  I have installed 64-bit for regular Ubuntu.  What gives?
2009-10-28T11:05:00.000Z	rww	steven_	what's the output if you type "uname -a" in a terminal?
