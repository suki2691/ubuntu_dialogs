2011-04-23T13:26:00.000Z	Blarumyrram		Hello. I'm using Ubuntu 10.10. I can't understand at all how Print Screen works. When I press it, I get a dialogue, with an option for "copy to clipboard"; when I press that, it copies the screenshot to clipboard. However when I then copy a piece of text, the screenshot is removed from clipboard. Is this a bug? When I for example copy an image in Gimp & then copy a piece of text, the image isn't removed from clipboard, so I don't think
