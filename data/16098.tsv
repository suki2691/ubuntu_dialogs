2011-04-07T00:30:00.000Z	vaadoo		Hello Ubuntu Masters...can I change 10.10 desktop installtion to Netbook Ubuntu?
2011-04-07T00:30:00.000Z	vaadoo		so, kind of a "downgrade"
2011-04-07T00:31:00.000Z	Braiam	vaadoo	search for the netbook metapackage in synaptic
2011-04-07T00:35:00.000Z	Braiam	vaadoo	no, it's going to install it with they dependencies, in other word it doesn't uninstall anything
