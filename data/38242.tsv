2010-01-27T19:40:00.000Z	jcarroll		My real question is: 'd like to upgrade from 8.04.3 LTS to the latest release (9.10); according to the doc's on help.ubuntu.com, the "supported" path is to upgrade through each release.  Is this correct?  Can I expect *support* while passing through 8.10 and 9.04?
