2008-07-08T09:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	AMLNXUSR	are you trying to play two sounds at once(like say, an mp3, and a flash video?)
2008-07-08T09:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	AMLNXUSR	i bet you're dealing w/ pulse audio issues...  i had a similar prob, couldn't play two sounds at once, if i got an IM the "receive" tone, woudl cause me to lose sound in flash.
