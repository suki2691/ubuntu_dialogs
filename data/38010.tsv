2010-02-02T01:44:00.000Z	slashroot		I have a WD external drive that comes from windows, but was lent to a MacOS user who apparently accidentally re-partitioned the drive to HFS.  It now will now mount on windows, but the owner brought it to me, and I find that it does mount on ubuntu.  However, I cannot read anything but the new HFS+ partition.  What tool might I use to examine the deleted partition if that's possible?

2010-02-02T01:45:00.000Z	slashroot	KaiForce	Yes - the new partition is the entire drive.
2010-02-02T01:46:00.000Z	KaiForce	slashroot	 i think you are out of luck
