2007-11-19T19:57:00.000Z	mcummings	Codenut	in a nutshell, su expects you to know the password of the user you are su'ing to (it's old school, so to speak, elevation); sudo lets you do the same things, but is based on your password/permissions, so su - expects root's password, but sudo su - expects yours; similar but slightly different approaches
