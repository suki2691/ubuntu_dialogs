2007-10-18T19:43:00.000Z	wezza	Psi-Jack	so maybe there is less attention from dev for kubuntu?
2007-10-18T19:43:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	wezza	That's my concern, yes. I've seen differences in it, on every time I installed, since 6.10 to 7.4 and now 7.10
2007-10-18T19:44:00.000Z	wezza	Psi-Jack	i was wondering to install kubuntu on my girlfriends pc, since she like all that shines.. but maybe choose ubuntu instead..
