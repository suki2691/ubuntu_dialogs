2009-03-03T08:23:00.000Z	shavin		Guys i read this line on forums: could you explain how to do what it is telling(instaliing intrepid on pen drive)? " I recommend formating the flash drive to ResierFS (mounted with 'noatime,nodiratime,notail' options) and mount tmpfs to /tmp, /var/tmp and /var/log (like EeePC does) to increase speed and minimise writes"
2009-03-03T08:23:00.000Z	shavin		i want to know about the tmps
2009-03-03T08:23:00.000Z	shavin		tmlfs*
2009-03-03T08:24:00.000Z	max_	shavin	does /tmp have it's own partition?
