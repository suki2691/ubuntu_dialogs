2008-08-25T08:25:00.000Z	jordo2323	geek_	in other words, how do I connect to an encrypted network through the command line... :)
2008-08-25T08:25:00.000Z	geek_	jordo2323	no idea, i use network manager and its front ends ;p
2008-08-25T08:26:00.000Z	jordo2323	geek_	so do I, but for some reason the wireless functions of network manager does not work....I can still connect to an unprotected network by doing sudo dhclient though...
