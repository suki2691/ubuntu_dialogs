2007-10-24T15:34:00.000Z	tommw		hello, I am completely new to Linux/Ubuntu and am currently downloading 7.10 to have a play with. This will be my first time using an OS other than Windows, and I am looking to dual-boot Ubuntu temporarily alongside Windows. Also, the computer I will use Ubuntu on is on a wireless network. Will I have any problems with the network card drivers/connecting to the network? Thanks in advance
