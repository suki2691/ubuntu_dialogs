2008-08-04T03:36:00.000Z	soundray		How can I re-enable a display that I've turned off with xrandr? I can do it with System-Preferences-Screen Resolution, but I'm looking for the command...

2008-08-04T03:38:00.000Z	nathan	soundray	great, well, its all in there..
2008-08-04T03:39:00.000Z	soundray	nathan	no, I can't find a way to turn a display on once it's been turned off with --off
