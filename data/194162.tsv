2007-08-29T15:09:00.000Z	masss		can someone tell me why my internet connection under ubuntu is soooo slow, and so quick with windows plzz
2007-08-29T15:10:00.000Z	pike_	masss	is it still 'slow' if ya use ip instead of dns name? cat /etc/resolv.conf and make sure there is one entry for nameserver typically on a home box this will be your router ip. other than that id suspect ipv6
