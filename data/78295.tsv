2010-06-01T09:32:00.000Z	pat5star		I'm using firefox and I do have quite a few google labs enabled so I'm wondering where to begin troubleshooting this. it would be so much easier if you all just told me none of you can connect right now either ;)

2010-06-02T11:03:00.000Z	pat5star	Docteh	lol, tomorrow I'll look into more and I'd be very surprised to find that nobody is maintaining it. if you like podcasts, it's a great podcatcher. I'll take it over myself if it comes to it!
