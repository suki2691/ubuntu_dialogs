2008-10-24T08:32:00.000Z	[TiZ]		I'm trying to create a script that will make it easier for me to edit my LiveDVD. The idea is to automatically set up a chroot and give me a terminal where I can edit away to my heart's content. And then when I'm done, it will clean up for me and close the chroot. I threw together a script with all the important parts left out... I don't know what to do next. It's at http://pastebin.com/m8e67e3c. Where do I go from here? Any and all help wou
