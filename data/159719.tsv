2007-03-12T07:06:00.000Z	ttuttle		I'm used to Gentoo, where I have to do all the work to integrate things.  Ubuntu is so polished in comparison.
2007-03-12T07:07:00.000Z	h1st0	ttuttle	Yeah its nice.  Do you know when he's going to do this.  Because fiesty is going to rock.
2007-03-12T07:08:00.000Z	ttuttle	h1st0	Oh, it's definitely at least a few months ago.
