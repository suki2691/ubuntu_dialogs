2010-09-05T02:56:00.000Z	lxndr_		Question: What is the justification for the movement of the window controls from the right to the left?
2010-09-05T02:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	lxndr_	they want to use the space in the left for something else
2010-09-05T02:58:00.000Z	lxndr_	erUSUL	What is this particular 'something else' that prevents it from occupying the left hand side?
