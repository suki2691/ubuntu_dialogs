2011-11-30T05:03:00.000Z	theshadow		How do I view Empathy notfications. For example I got the notification "Blah has request to view your status". Before Unity I could click on Empathys icon and view the notification and respond to it. Now I can't figure out where/how to do this.

2011-11-30T05:04:00.000Z	Scott_S	theshadow	The mail icon has a 'Chat' option. That is the location of Empathy. Other than that, I'm not sure.
