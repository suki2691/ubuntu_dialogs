2009-05-17T11:03:00.000Z	ohzie		Hey everyone! :) I've got this problem where Ubuntu can't tell that I have an nvidia graphics card. When I LSHW is shows up as UNCLAIMED MCP67 co-processor
2009-05-17T11:03:00.000Z	ohzie		Any ideas on how to fix this?

2009-05-17T11:06:00.000Z	ohzie	HDFAIL	I don't mean that the problem is rare, so much as that the install of an OS on a USB hard drive actually working, at all, is very rare. The fact that it worked WELL as ubuntu 8 is amazing.
