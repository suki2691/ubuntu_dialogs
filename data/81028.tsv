2008-08-30T10:54:00.000Z	bobernet	bubaphex	what interface?  raggle and snownews are both nice RSS readers
2008-08-30T10:56:00.000Z	bobernet	bubaphex	they're both console apps, so if that's not your cup of tea, might look elsewhere.  i spend most of my time in non-gui apps, so can't help much there.
