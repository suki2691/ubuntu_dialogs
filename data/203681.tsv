2006-06-26T08:27:00.000Z	Moodles		is it possible, to resize an existing EXT3 partitioned drive? it's 250gb and I want to make it smaller to 242gb
2006-06-26T08:27:00.000Z	mp3guy	Moodles	you can resize ext3 non-destructively with gparted
2006-06-26T08:29:00.000Z	Moodles	mp3guy	does the 5.10 ubuntu cd have 'gparted'?
2006-06-26T08:53:00.000Z	Moodles	mp3guy	thanks, gparted is working like a charm
