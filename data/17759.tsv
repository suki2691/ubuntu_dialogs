I think the dirty setup I did with the ppa may have something to do with it, as clearly people use separate X screens with nvidia cards all of the time and have no issues, so I should be able to as well
2011-10-02T20:45:00.000Z	nmvictor	roasted_	sorry if you think so,luck with a solution to your problem anyway. Wish i could help but I dnot know Nvidia further than the fact that ist been mentioned so often on this channel, usually as a problem-card.
