2008-10-13T02:55:00.000Z	songexe	losher	i have my /home on the same partition.  i'll probably just end up formatting.
2008-10-13T02:56:00.000Z	losher	songexe	if you reformat you'll lose the contents of /home. Are you sure you want to do that?
2008-10-13T02:56:00.000Z	songexe	losher	well, it's a fairly new install anyway, and I can just do a backup to my external.  I'm just trying to avoid a format alltogether.
