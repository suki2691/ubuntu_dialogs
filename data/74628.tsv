2008-11-12T00:30:00.000Z	madsj		the fonts in emacs have gotten ugly; I'm using -adobe-courier-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
2008-11-12T00:30:00.000Z	madsj		italics and smaller fonts look horribly; any idea which package I need ?
2008-11-12T00:31:00.000Z	joebodo	madsj	have you tried to change the rendering option ?
2008-11-12T01:00:00.000Z	madsj	joebodo	thanks; I think I erased some settings in my .Xdefaults by accident ... this is most likely the cause!
