2005-08-28T14:59:00.000Z	lyly		I try to have realplayer work. some one did it?
2005-08-28T15:00:00.000Z	dbernar1	lyly	there is a page on the wiki, wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats that shows how to get that working.
2005-08-28T15:01:00.000Z	dbernar1	lyly	go to the wiki, and install it from the normal way...and it shall work. remove all what you did before...unless the wiki says that marillat is how you install it anyhow:)
