2011-01-05T05:52:00.000Z	kcorcoran_	NixGeek	that's what i am seeing, i am trying to understand which i should install.
2011-01-05T05:53:00.000Z	kcorcoran_		thank you.
2011-01-05T05:53:00.000Z	NixGeek	kcorcoran_	i'd say the frontend and backend, and control center, but i've never really messed with it, so someone else might have a better suggestion
