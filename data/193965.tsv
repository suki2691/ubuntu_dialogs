2006-05-17T08:50:00.000Z	clif		Oh heres another question is there any way to get ubuntu to get a screen resulation highter then 800 X 600 It gives me only 640 X 480 or 800 X 600? I normally run 1024 X 768 and I like that better?

2006-05-17T08:52:00.000Z	hurax	clif	even the vesa driver is able to do 1024x768
2006-05-17T08:55:00.000Z	hurax	clif	you probably should reconfigure the x server
