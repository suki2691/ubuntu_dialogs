2011-03-17T04:57:00.000Z	tsimpson	giiker	then you need to use another terminal, or screen
2011-03-17T04:58:00.000Z	giiker	tsimpson	funny thing is I'm running my irssi inside screen and I logged in into a remote shell using ssh, ahha, complicated, I know, I know I can just dettach, but I thought there was another way instead of pressing Ctrl -a -d
2011-03-17T05:00:00.000Z	tsimpson	giiker	no, just open another window, you don't need to detach from screen to do that
