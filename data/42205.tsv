2009-11-20T04:23:00.000Z	mrqismrx	trism	yes it says that I should config it in system preferences and click on Screen Actions but it's not listed there and I tried to do another "sudo apt-get install brightside" but it said it was already installed aswell
2009-11-20T04:24:00.000Z	trism	mrqismrx	yeah, I didn't notice an menu item for it either, just alt+f2 and type brightside-properties to bring up the configuration dialog
