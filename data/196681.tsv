2006-03-06T17:57:00.000Z	Rob_Dude		Can someone help me.  I'm really hungry....I tried 'sudo apt-get Pizza-Hut' but I got an 'Out of Delivery Zone Error'.  I looked in my /etc/pizza.conf but everything looks right to me.
2006-03-06T17:57:00.000Z	Rob_Dude		Aww, I was just having some fun :)  My fault.
2006-03-06T06:00:00.000Z	Rob_Dude		I've installed mySQL just now; and I've used it in Windows before.  I'm unable to log into it though, I've got a MySQL Administrator GUI (yeah, kind of cheating, I know) but I can't log in because I don't know the correct user/pass
