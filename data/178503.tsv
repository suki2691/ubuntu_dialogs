2007-04-10T06:20:00.000Z	h3xis	ami1	what is it reporting?
2007-04-10T06:21:00.000Z	h3xis	ami1	had the same thing happen. that's high. you need to have it sent in to be looked at
2007-04-10T06:22:00.000Z	h3xis	ami1	boot up a livecd of another distro (knoppix) and see if it's reporting the same thing
