2012-10-12T16:51:00.000Z	despe70		a while ago I installed Ubuntu on my Windows computer - dualboot. I still have the partition of it, and the old Ubuntu should still be there, but somehow I changed it so that Windows starts automatically without giving me the choice. Is there a way to boot in Ubuntu?

2012-10-12T16:52:00.000Z	despe70	ActionParsnip	never tried that - I do a reboot, and then start pressing shift ?
2012-10-12T16:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	despe70	yes as soon as the system starts to turn on
