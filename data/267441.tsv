2010-09-27T03:28:00.000Z	thanis1200		can someone type me in private message i would like toa ask something about my ubuntu desktop
2010-09-27T03:30:00.000Z	thanis1200		is it software or hardware problem because my system monitor says that im running on 99-100% of CPU and im not doing anythin special at all
2010-09-27T03:30:00.000Z	maco	thanis1200	i'd check that with "uptime" or "top" since the system monitor /itself/ is known to drive up cpu usage
2010-09-27T03:31:00.000Z	maco	thanis1200	yes, the gnome gui for system monitor uses a ton of cpu so anytime you look at it, it shows the cpu being in high usage
