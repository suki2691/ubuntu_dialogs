2011-08-15T19:49:00.000Z	theadmin	famine	I suggest qBittorrent, it's quite awesome
2011-08-15T19:49:00.000Z	theadmin	famine	Other than this, there is a native utorrent client but it's linked against horribly outdated libraries and just DO NOT WORK
2011-11-10T20:21:00.000Z	theadmin	famine	Search for "Login screen" or something in the settings
