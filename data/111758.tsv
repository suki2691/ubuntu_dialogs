2012-01-05T16:14:00.000Z	tprime		 Hello channel. I'm trying to set up a bridged network (0) in addition to a nat-ed one(1) for a freebsd guest under ubunut 11.10/kvm, and am probably missing something really stupid. The bridge itself is working, the guest does receive a DHCP address from the network DHCP server, and it can ping it's intranet subnet (which seem to go via (0)) and the internet (via (1)), but neither the host, nor outside machines can access the guest on the DCHP
