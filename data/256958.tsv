2004-12-07T14:02:00.000Z	palle		okay, but i wan't to have root rights while in the xwindow so i don't have to use the terminal so much
2004-12-07T14:03:00.000Z	palle		is that possible?
2004-12-07T14:05:00.000Z	palle		why should i use sudo so much then? that is so annoying, i want to use the file explorer to copy files that's so much faster then writing all the time...
