2012-06-20T00:59:00.000Z	rudi_		can't find any duplicate records in sources.list. Any idea how to fix this: "Duplicate sources.list entry http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/ precise/partner i386 Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.canonical.com_ubuntu_dists_precise_partner_binary-i386_Packages)" ?
2012-06-20T01:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rudi_	 maybe comming from /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ entries
2012-06-20T01:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rudi_	 often its quicker to just backup imporntant stuff and do a clean install.
2012-06-20T01:15:00.000Z	rudi_	Dr_Willis	would that mean downloading and burning a Desktop image and taking it from there?
