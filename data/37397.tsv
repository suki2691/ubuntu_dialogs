2010-02-13T19:42:00.000Z	Out_Cold	JStoone	there is a hard reset feature, anything else can be considered unlawful and off topic
2010-02-13T19:44:00.000Z	Out_Cold	JStoone	there are brute force methods for cracking routers but again.. wrong place to ask
2010-02-13T19:44:00.000Z	JStoone	Out_Cold	thanks, but a little hard..
