2009-03-30T04:27:00.000Z	anthonys	Guest12053	true, but Meditbuntu is *supposed* to be safe, and all it does is add support for some nonfree codecs etc
2009-03-30T04:27:00.000Z	Guest12053	anthonys	Automatix was supposed to be the same way.. ;)
2009-03-30T04:28:00.000Z	anthonys	Guest12053	yeahâ€¦ but it's alot easier to use Medibuntu than to do it yourself
