2010-01-10T02:29:00.000Z	Bruno`		hello !
2010-01-10T02:31:00.000Z	Bruno`		my remote control used to work with Ubuntu, but I updated and it doesn't work anymore :( ... in the remote control properties the "auto detect" stuff gives only shit.. But if I deplug/replug my receiver I got in dmesg something like lirc_mceusb[7]: TopSeed Technology Corp. eHome Infrared Transceiver on usb1:7 ; lirc_atiusb: USB remote driver for LIRC $Revision: 1.85 $
2010-01-10T02:31:00.000Z	Bruno`		but still nothing works
