2008-03-01T21:57:00.000Z	rhsanborn		Hey guys, I'm running gutsy on an HP laptop. I'm using ndiswrapper to get wireless with wpasupplicant, and it does work. The only problem I have, is that every time I login, I have to open the network manager and clear out and type my passkey back in to get it to reconnect
2008-03-01T21:58:00.000Z	rhsanborn		Any ideas? I'm almost to the point that I'm going to write a short shell script to run the iwconfig commands manually.
