2012-02-12T21:33:00.000Z	tyler		hey guys, i'm new to ubuntu. i just successfully installed photoshop cs5 with wine, now i need to install dreamweaver. could anybody help me out here? the photoshop installer was modified so you didn't need wine tricks, but the dreamweaver installer didn't work.

2012-02-12T21:34:00.000Z	theadmin	tyler	Server? Why are you running wine on the server edition? That hardly makes sense
2012-02-12T21:35:00.000Z	theadmin	tyler	Err... you need to type "/join #winehq" (without quotes). You'll also need to register, likely.
