2007-12-18T19:14:00.000Z	Jowi		hi, quick question: what spellchecker does AbiWord use?
2007-12-18T19:16:00.000Z	Schiz0	Jowi	I'm assuming it uses aspell
2007-12-18T19:16:00.000Z	Schiz0	Jowi	that is, if it doesn't have it's own built in one
2007-12-18T19:16:00.000Z	Jowi	Schiz0	ok. will install it. it does not seem to recognise ispell even though Enchant is installed
