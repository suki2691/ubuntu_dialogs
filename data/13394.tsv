2011-06-11T19:05:00.000Z	craigbass1976		I can't get my new monitor to work right.  I'm only getting 1368x768, and I should be able to get 1440x900.  I'm running LXDE.  The max resolution my preferences --> monitor settings gives me is the 1368x768.  I've done a sudo dpkg reconfigure x-server.org, messed with xrandr, but neither worked.  I've also edited xorg.conf, but the file was a bit sparse to begin with so I'm wondering if that's not the preferred method anymore.
