2010-09-13T01:52:00.000Z	mysteryguy		Hello, I'm trying to install ubuntu on a netbook thru a liveCD and it is still loading after about 30minutes, I did test that liveCD on my PC first and it works fine.
2010-09-13T01:54:00.000Z	mysteryguy		32bit version, eee netbook, it worked before fine
2010-09-13T01:54:00.000Z	mysteryguy		even though I did get a new .iso
