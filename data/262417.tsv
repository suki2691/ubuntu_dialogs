2005-10-10T11:09:00.000Z	wordydude		I installed ubuntu and I am at the login screen.  I did not set-up a user account/password.  Whats are the default settings?
2005-10-10T11:10:00.000Z	Blissex	wordydude	now that's an interesting question...
2005-10-10T11:10:00.000Z	Blissex	wordydude	because Ubuntu by default does not allow 'root' logins :-).
