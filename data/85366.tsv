2008-07-17T21:14:00.000Z	Heroin	debCarlos	why add /bin/sh and not /bin/bash?
2008-07-17T21:16:00.000Z	debCarlos	Heroin	I don't know, but i think it's because you're saving the file like file.sh... and the tutorial i am following says that  :)
2008-07-17T21:21:00.000Z	Heroin	debCarlos	do you want to test my script?
