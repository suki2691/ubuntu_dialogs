Rhythmbox uses gstreamer which I believe favors the new ALSA system.  I would suggest checking the sound settings in XMMS and trying different output devices (esd/alsa/oss) until you find one that (hopefully) works.

2006-03-18T11:38:00.000Z	Mosi	silvaran	^_^ wow, that was easy. I didn't know ALSA was better than OSS, thanks :)
2006-03-18T11:39:00.000Z	silvaran	Mosi	No problem... I think technically it's "better" now (I've had enormous pains with alsa in the past while it was maturing), but OSS is deprecated in the kernel.
