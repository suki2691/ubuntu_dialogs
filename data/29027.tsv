2010-08-12T07:51:00.000Z	robg		I have added the xbmc repo on a fresh build of Lucid. I run apt-get update and there are no packages listed in the repository except the gnupg key
2010-08-12T07:52:00.000Z	RealOpty	robg	try reloading the repositories
2010-08-12T07:53:00.000Z	robg	RealOpty	you mean apt-get update? if so I tried that. I also removed it from source list and readded it incase it might be a typo or something
2010-08-12T07:53:00.000Z	RealOpty	robg	ok. i dont know then, sorry.
