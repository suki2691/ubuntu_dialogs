2011-06-03T06:15:00.000Z	cablop	arzy	the bad thing about reverting to alsa i sthe support for the microphone went really bad on it, then i have to enable pulse again and use another workarrount, that is go to pulseaudio settings and create a simultaneous output for all audio outputs then select that virtual device as the default one, the downside of it, if you use multiple users on same machine they cannotnaccess device...
