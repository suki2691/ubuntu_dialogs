2010-05-07T07:39:00.000Z	tamale1		All, I'm noticing some very strange issues with two of my ubuntu computers after upgrading from 9.10 to 10.04.
2010-05-07T07:39:00.000Z	tamale1		On my laptop, after several hours of normal behavior and performance, the machine becomes utterly unresponsive. The moue cursor still tracks, but I can't really click on anything or type anything, as it takes almost 30 seconds for my commands to have any effect.
2010-05-07T07:39:00.000Z	tamale1		On my server, I have a constant load average of around 0.3 under the exact same workload now, while before the upgrade the load hovered between 0.01 and 0.05.
