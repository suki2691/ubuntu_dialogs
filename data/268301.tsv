2011-06-09T01:33:00.000Z	hypatia	NFischer	install the PAE kernel from synaptic
2011-06-09T01:33:00.000Z	hypatia	NFischer	you need it to see more than 3.2GB ram in 32-bit ubuntu
2011-06-09T01:36:00.000Z	hypatia	NFischer	each process will only see 3gb ram. but that's a lot per process, and some apps use multiple processes :)
