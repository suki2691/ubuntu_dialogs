2009-02-16T03:29:00.000Z	LogicFan	viktorkAZ	what do you mean exactly?  ubuntu install by default installs X
2009-02-16T03:32:00.000Z	viktorkAZ	LogicFan	Well actually I need to know if i have installed a couple of libraries like m4, autoconf, libtool, zlib, etc, etc.. so my actual question would be how can i check any particular library if its already installed or not?
