2010-05-29T17:22:00.000Z	Ravious	kimiskov	are you on a laptop or desktop?
2010-05-29T17:23:00.000Z	Ravious	kimiskov	have you checked in your bois for smart fan controls?
2010-05-29T17:25:00.000Z	Ravious	kimiskov	there is an app called lm-sensors that can control fans. Not sure if it will work for you or not, but might be a good place to start.
