2012-07-09T21:22:00.000Z	tokaboka		Hi, my sound stops working ocassionally. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04, any pointers?
2012-07-09T21:23:00.000Z	tokaboka		For example my sound was working, I suspended by computer, then when I started it up again, the sound was no longer working
2012-07-09T21:25:00.000Z	tokaboka		what could suspending and rebooting my computer have possibly done to make the sound stop working?
2012-07-09T21:27:00.000Z	recon_lap	tokaboka	did you plug in or out any earphones?
