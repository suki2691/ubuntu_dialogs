2009-04-06T23:39:00.000Z	jamalfanaian	mweichert	you can disable sudo to specific users, don't think you can specify it just through SSH
2009-04-06T23:39:00.000Z	mweichert	jamalfanaian	right, so maybe I can configure SSH to add users to a particular group when logged in, and then deny that group access to sudo?
