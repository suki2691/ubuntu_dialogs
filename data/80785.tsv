2009-06-01T02:23:00.000Z	DiffyQ		Hey. I just got my computer back after eight months, and now I'm only getting sound through my headphones. This happened when I first installed Ubuntu, but I fixed it. Can anyone suggest anything?

2009-06-01T02:24:00.000Z	DiffyQ	Slart	Ha, yes, I've checked. Everything's on.
