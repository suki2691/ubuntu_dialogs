2011-11-11T20:46:00.000Z	Tausen		Hey everyone - I've got a major issue with my ubuntu 11.04. (let me know if I'm asking this to frequently!)
2011-11-11T20:46:00.000Z	Tausen		Whenever I connect to a wireless network or plug in a network cable, a kworker process uses 100% of one core of the CPU in spikes, causing the entire system to lag horribly
2011-11-11T20:46:00.000Z	Tausen		I posted on the ubuntu forums with details, here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1878993
