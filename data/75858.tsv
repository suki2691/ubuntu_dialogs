2010-12-28T03:53:00.000Z	LonelyDragon757		i feel like an idiot..  but i am trying to update my Ubuntu 10.04 system with better resolution to my video driver.  but I can not seem to be able to find xorg.conf (at least not where I would expect).  it isn't at /etc/X11/xorg.conf.   and not sure what xorg is using when it boots... I am getting frustrated.
2010-12-28T03:55:00.000Z	LonelyDragon757		ok... everytime I create one then... it messes up... and not sure how to configure the xorg so it would boot properly?
