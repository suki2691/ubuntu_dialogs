2009-04-06T09:53:00.000Z	nkei0		I'm having a problem with networking...  However, I don't think it's related to Ubuntu, but I don't know.  I set up my D-link wireless router from within Ubuntu and am using WPA with a pre-shared key.  However, I am dualbooting winxp and when i restart into xp it doesn't even detect the network....

2009-04-06T09:53:00.000Z	nkei0	zenlunatic	I figured, I just was wondering if it could be related somehow.
2009-04-06T09:54:00.000Z	zenlunatic	nkei0	perhaps
