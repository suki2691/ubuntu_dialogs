2005-07-16T05:22:00.000Z	Danar		how come windows don't snap to borders?
2005-07-16T05:23:00.000Z	medgno	Danar	are you using gnome or kde?
2005-07-16T05:23:00.000Z	medgno	Danar	try holding down Shift while moving the window. It should now strongly snap to other windows. It still will not snap on resize, though
2005-07-16T05:24:00.000Z	medgno	Danar	no problem
