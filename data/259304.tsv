2005-07-18T16:30:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Is anyone else having some problems with marillat? When I try to get the newest acroread from it, it tells me: acroread:
2005-07-18T16:30:00.000Z	Hikaru79		  Depends: libc6 (>=2.3.2.ds1-21) but 2.3.2.ds1-20ubuntu13 is to be installed
2005-07-18T16:30:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Hikaru79	don't use marilliat
2005-07-18T16:30:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Hikaru79	use hoary-extras from the backports project
