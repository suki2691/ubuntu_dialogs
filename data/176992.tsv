2006-07-10T14:19:00.000Z	shen		I've got an ibook running ubuntu 6.06. Any pointers on how to get it to recognise my usb mouse when I boot it up? Currently I need to unplug it and plug it back in before it starts working
2006-07-10T14:20:00.000Z	atsugnam	shen	are the usb modules loading at boot?
2006-07-10T14:21:00.000Z	shen	atsugnam	I think they are loading, my usb drive is found right away, but not the mouse.
