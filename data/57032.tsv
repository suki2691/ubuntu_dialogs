2010-11-09T08:14:00.000Z	fuzzybunny69y		hey guys for some reason my gnome-panel keeps crashing and restarting and keeps shifting windows that I have open up and down as they reaccomodate for the crashing/respwaning gnome-panel. Prior to this I had the indicator global menu applet enabled and I opened a java program(freemind) and then this problem started happening. If I go into the terminal and type sudo gnome-panel --replace a new top and bottom panel gets created
2010-11-09T08:14:00.000Z	fuzzybunny69y		but in the window list I can still see a "starting panel" program opening and closing constantly. Does anyone know how I cold fix this?
2010-11-09T08:14:00.000Z	IdleOne	fuzzybunny69y	kill freemind and see if the problem persists
2010-11-09T08:18:00.000Z	fuzzybunny69y	IdleOne	yeah I tried that and I restarted as well and it still keeps crashing and respwaning and shifting every program that I have maximized
