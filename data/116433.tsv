2007-10-18T20:25:00.000Z	disasm	[11Touche]	did you compare the xorg.conf with the one before the upgrade?
2007-10-18T20:25:00.000Z	[11Touche]	disasm	yes, and I tried to roll back to the old xorg.conf, but didn't work, it went in safe-display mode :(
2007-10-18T20:26:00.000Z	[11Touche]	disasm	is there a way to turn off autodetection? I don't care running in console to get the problem solved, but with autodetect, it seems like it won't even try my edited xorg
