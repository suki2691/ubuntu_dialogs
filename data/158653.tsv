2010-06-29T01:45:00.000Z	Slart	darko3d	try wine .. none of those listed by ubuntu are really alternatives
2010-06-29T01:45:00.000Z	Slart	darko3d	although vim/emacs might be.. after lots and lots of training
2010-06-29T01:48:00.000Z	Slart	darko3d	have a look at some of those.. none of them are really Dreamweaver killers though =)
