2012-05-26T13:17:00.000Z	schreber		Another odd question I like the theme kfaenza as opposed to the standard, if you want to call it that, faenza theme is there anyway to get it to work under gnome/cinnamon?
2012-05-26T13:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	schreber	cinnamon isn't supported here
2012-05-26T13:20:00.000Z	schreber	ActionParsnip	I suppose there is a #cinnamon for such things then, right?
2012-05-26T13:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	schreber	perhaps, or you could join the mint channel, they use cinnamon
