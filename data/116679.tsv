2007-10-15T06:46:00.000Z	M_WS		I've just downloaded and burned Ubuntu 7.04 on CDROM but It doesn't boot up with it, my boot sequence is ok. What did I do wrong here (I do get it started in windows) ?
2007-10-15T06:47:00.000Z	ingo_	M_WS	are you sure that you have burned it as a bootable cd?
2007-10-15T06:47:00.000Z	M_WS	ingo_	Ive just unpacked the iso and burned it on cd. is that correct?
2007-10-15T06:47:00.000Z	ingo_	M_WS	dont unpack the iso-image, but burn the whole image!
