2009-11-01T01:36:00.000Z	trism	JessD	I have a linksys WUSB54G and karmic is the first ubuntu release I didn't need ndiswrapper to get it to work
2009-11-01T01:36:00.000Z	JessD	trism	: Did it work just by plugging it in?  Cause it's not doing anything for me
2009-11-01T01:37:00.000Z	trism	JessD	yes, just plugging in and configuring with network manager
