2007-09-24T09:27:00.000Z	firebird619	riotkittie	I hadn't checked at all until now when I started having the problem. Bad practice on my part. Can I delete logs and clean apt to get some space back?

2007-09-24T09:32:00.000Z	firebird619	riotkittie	That is OK. I was patiently waiting for a response from you or anyone else who can offer advice. The wonderful thing about Ubuntu is this channel to get help. I know someone will answer me at sometime.
