2008-09-02T07:16:00.000Z	CShadowRun		is there any good way to watch the CPU use of one specific program?
2008-09-02T07:16:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R	CShadowRun	system monitor
2008-09-02T07:16:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R	CShadowRun	or top\
2008-09-02T07:17:00.000Z	CShadowRun	R_YoYo_R	yea system monitor uses enough resources to play a direct3d game twice, and top constantly shuffles the results so it's really hard to track one process
