2006-05-13T07:06:00.000Z	mikl	bimberi	yes, but to do that, you have to be registered with nickserv
2006-05-13T07:07:00.000Z	bimberi	mikl	ah, so not registering alone then :)
2006-05-13T07:07:00.000Z	mikl	bimberi	I'm not sure if it's automatic these days - there was some talk about making it automatic, anyways
