2006-09-05T13:29:00.000Z	spuddogg		Does anyone know where the screen savers are stored?  I'd like to edit the source, if I can find them.
2006-09-05T13:30:00.000Z	Warbo	spuddogg	/usr/lib/xscreensaver I think (I wouldn't know about source, maybe "sudo apt-get source xscreensaver")
2006-09-05T13:31:00.000Z	Warbo	spuddogg	"sudo apt-get source xscreensaver" will get the source to screeensaver in the current directory, so you can work from there
