2005-05-04T13:14:00.000Z	slept		I'm looking for a package with wich I can read keycodes for volume keys .. , I know there is /was one in debian but I  can't even find it there is keycodes the wrong expression to look for ?
2005-05-04T13:15:00.000Z	djm62	slept	do you need to know the key codes? you can set shortcuts in gnome without knowing them

2005-10-19T11:27:00.000Z	djm62	slept	isn't grub splashimage a different thing? I do have that
