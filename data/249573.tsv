2009-09-09T11:19:00.000Z	CatEater		i still can't get my vm window to appear on a windows xp host. i click on the taskbar button, but the window doesn't appear on screen. i know i've asked here before, but i forgot what to try. i'm using 3.0.4 r50677. any ideas?
2009-09-09T11:20:00.000Z	CatEater		also i just realized i said that to the wrong channel
2009-09-09T11:20:00.000Z	CatEater		however, if anyone can recommend a vm setup for unbuntu, that would be appreciated
