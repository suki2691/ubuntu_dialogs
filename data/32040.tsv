2010-09-24T19:14:00.000Z	tmba		hi there..  I see one of my packages has 2 entries when I do apt-cache show on it. Somehow the latest version is never detected when I do an apt-get upgrade. Any ideas on how I can proceed to upgrade to the last version (it should be there when its shown in apt-cache right?)
