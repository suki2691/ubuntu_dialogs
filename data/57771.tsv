2009-05-08T20:36:00.000Z	Bodsda	TwoPointOh	yeah, any particular reason it has to be run before gnome starts?
2009-05-08T20:37:00.000Z	TwoPointOh	Bodsda	yeah, i'm creating an OEM install. got everything working perfectly, copied approriate files into /etc/skel, and i've written a script to replace /home/oem with $HOME in any files that contian it
2009-05-08T20:39:00.000Z	Bodsda	TwoPointOh	so, why does it need to run before gnome...?
