2005-12-24T13:19:00.000Z	joedj		yeah, that'll work
2005-12-24T13:20:00.000Z	joedj	dooglus	i can put it indented under the "iface lo inet loopback", right? the iptables rules relate to lo
2005-12-24T13:21:00.000Z	dooglus	joedj	I believe so.  I use a "pre-up" line indented there.  I don't know if the indentation serves any purpose other than looking nice though.
