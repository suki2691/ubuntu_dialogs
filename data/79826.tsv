2010-03-04T06:50:00.000Z	complexity		I have been receiving the same error that others have when shutting down or rebooting with network shares - CIFS  VSF: blah blah cmd 50 etc..but it happens during a session, about every 30 minutes or so, not when shutting down. It makes problems with the scripts I run overnight copying files and backing up. I am using 9.10 with an RJ45 connection..I read all of the 55 posts about it on the forum, to no avail....any ideas out there
