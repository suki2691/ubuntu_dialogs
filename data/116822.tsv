2007-10-13T12:43:00.000Z	mmschnei		hello, I am new to ubuntu and I have a few questions. First of all I just got a shiny new quad core CPU, what do I need to do to have ubuntu utilize this properly? I have read about SMP kernels but I don't see them in synaptic anymore (posts were dated about 6 months that mentioned SMP kernels)
2007-10-13T12:43:00.000Z	astro76	mmschnei	the generic kernel now handles SMP
2007-10-13T12:44:00.000Z	mmschnei	astro76	ok, thats what I was thinking, so its already ready to go? (just want to clarify) no furhter action is required?
2007-10-13T12:44:00.000Z	astro76	mmschnei	yes it's automatic
