2006-11-09T10:30:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	tgelter	in .bashrc if you use bash     export PATH=$PATH:/something/new/here
2006-11-09T10:31:00.000Z	tgelter	Kingsqueak	I thought I looked through the .bashrc and didn't find anything, but I'll look again
2006-11-09T10:31:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	tgelter	may be .bash_profile
