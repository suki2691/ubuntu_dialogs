2006-06-08T09:59:00.000Z	jughead		I'm having problems with accesssing ntfs partitions on other hard disks
2006-06-08T10:00:00.000Z	jughead		the help page indicates that windows partitions should be available by default, but I cannot access them
2006-06-08T10:02:00.000Z	jughead		yes garryfre, they are all enabled, but I don't have permission
2006-06-08T10:02:00.000Z	garryfre	jughead	Yep, same here.
