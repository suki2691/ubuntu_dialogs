2012-08-30T06:27:00.000Z	baldypal		newbie to ubuntu here. wondering if some one could help me out
2012-08-30T06:28:00.000Z	baldypal		i've download the 32 bit and 64 but iso. iso burned it to a cd. correctly...and i reboot and it goes right back into windows
2012-08-30T06:29:00.000Z	baldypal		and my bios is set to boot to cdrom, i've confirmed and done so with another working cd for drive backup
