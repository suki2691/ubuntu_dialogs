2010-02-06T12:42:00.000Z	blankthemuffin	res	this is because security is tighter through both technical and social means. Technical in that things are run as your user, reducing effect on the system, social in that typically one does not download third party software from un-trusted sources, it generally comes from the system packages which are secure. As for norton, it, and all windows anti-virus software is going to be completely worthless in linux.
