2009-01-24T11:43:00.000Z	Destil		I have a dead, once windows laptop, the bootfile became corrupt, and I was hoping to give ubuntu a go.  I downloaded the "desktop" iso, made the CD but seem unable to boot/install directly from it.  Might someone direct me to the correct download?

2009-01-24T11:46:00.000Z	Destil		okay lemme back up.. I am ignorant as to linux.... I think I need to load something else into the dead pc first to use the ubuntu cd install... but I dont know what
