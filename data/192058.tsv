2006-04-04T14:46:00.000Z	nickrud	kahn	your options are in System-Preferenced-Keyboard tab Layout Optins
2006-04-04T14:46:00.000Z	kahn	nickrud	i could only set it to change on right alt+shift
2006-04-04T14:47:00.000Z	nickrud	kahn	you could do some research on xkb (that's where the keyboard defs are) but it seems like latin to me :)
