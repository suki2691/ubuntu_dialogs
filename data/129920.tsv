2007-06-23T05:44:00.000Z	mdious	scaggot	 do you mean query as in...on windows how you can 'query modem'?
2007-06-23T05:45:00.000Z	scaggot	mdious	yes, i just need to make sure that the driver i just installed is the correct one. I've been trying to get my 56K modem to work in Ubuntu.
2007-06-23T05:47:00.000Z	mdious	scaggot	 not sure sorry, perhaps search google for the modem...ah took me forever to get my isdn working...finally realised there was just a few options in my kernel i needed to enable then all worked fine...was a great day! :D
