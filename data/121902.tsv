2008-01-11T01:14:00.000Z	mynyml		i have 5 older desktop computers that i'd like to join in a cluster - i've been reading about openmosix and clusterknoppix but clusterknoppix seems to be abandonware and openmosix about to reach end of life .... is there something practical i could do with ubuntu server for this?
