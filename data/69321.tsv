2009-01-08T22:15:00.000Z	ASULutzy		Seems to be lots of people today that got broken systems from upgrading, any idea what the culprit is yet? (Sorry I've been doing work stuff have just been peeking back at the channel every now and again)

2009-01-08T22:51:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Wingard	The recommended method is to use the restricted drivers first afaik, if that doesn't work, then you can try Envy, different people seem to have different results with each
