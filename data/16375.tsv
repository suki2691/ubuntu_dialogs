2011-04-28T21:53:00.000Z	conorhogan		can you update ubuntu 10.10 to 10.11 or do you have to download the iso and install fully?
2011-04-28T21:54:00.000Z	Witchsong	conorhogan	You can upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04.
2011-04-28T21:57:00.000Z	Witchsong	conorhogan	Just boot from the DVD and the setup will give you the option to either wipe your existing 10.10 install before you install or just upgrade it to 11.04.
