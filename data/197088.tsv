2007-06-08T08:14:00.000Z	tbtroja		Can anyone help me tweak my performance?  It's the worst it's ever been right now, and I've used Ubuntu for quite a while.  Whenever I load a program (anything: GNOME, Firefox, Geany, etc.) it takes _forever_ to load, and when it does everything is slow and processor-intensive.

2007-06-08T08:16:00.000Z	tbtroja		I'll try getting rid of it though..
