2011-11-10T16:39:00.000Z	driiper		Hello! I'm currently thinking of changing from Win 2008 server to Ubuntu and was wondering which of the releases are the most stable one? is there any diffrence at all ?

Your main decision is if you want to use 10.04 LTS (supported for 5 years after release on server) or the latest stable: 11.10 (supported for 18 months after release).  When support runs out, you simply upgrade release.  10.04 will not have software as new as 11.10
