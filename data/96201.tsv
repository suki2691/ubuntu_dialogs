2008-04-02T23:26:00.000Z	ryanhull76		I installed Ubuntu onto an external USB drive. This was for dual-booting XP and Ubuntu. However, the XP system resides on a Promise RAID controller. When I installed Ubuntu, it wrote GRUB over top of my XP RAID and I can no longer boot to XP. How do I fix/remove GRUB

When I install them (F6 - then s to add device) it won't show the array. However, I can see the 3 drives in Ubuntu. (i'm in LIVE CD right now) can I just edit/wipe GRUB and go from there?
