2008-04-16T11:17:00.000Z	msn	osfameron	try using jackd -d alsa
2008-04-16T11:17:00.000Z	msn	osfameron	then you can plug all apps into jackd
2008-04-16T11:19:00.000Z	osfameron	msn	I don't understand jackd at all - makes no sense at all :-(  Is it the only way?  I've used audacity on its own before (yesterday for example) without it hanging and refusing to play...
