2011-10-16T05:18:00.000Z	Flynsarmy		Hey guys, no compiz animations are working on gnome classic on 11.10. i've got nvidia-proprietry installed and activated so i've def got 3d going...any ideas? have CCSM installed and have a few keyboard shortcuts turned on (such as enhanced zoom desktop) but when i use it nothing happens. I can switch between desktops fine using the shortcuts but no animations

2011-10-16T05:21:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Stupendoussteve	I haven't seen one. Any ideas where it'd be if it existed? reisio ccsm = compizconfig-settings-manager
