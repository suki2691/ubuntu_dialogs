2005-09-01T05:19:00.000Z	loirmbs		im trying to install gimpshop, can you help me a bit, it says that: /lib/tls/i686/cmov/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.3.4' not found (required by gimp)

2005-09-01T05:20:00.000Z	loirmbs	cafuego	what do you mean by broken package :/
2005-09-01T05:20:00.000Z	jbailey	loirmbs	But you need to upgrade the whole system.  Just glibc on its own will cause you problems.
