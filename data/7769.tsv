2011-11-14T08:56:00.000Z	Johannes1		I am trying to set up a my own web server using a VPS I purchased. I think everything is set up correctly however how do I set up my DNS so my domains point to my IP? I literally have no idea how to do this.
2011-11-14T08:57:00.000Z	gloomer	Johannes1	 this is done  through the webinterface of the registrar
2011-11-14T08:57:00.000Z	gloomer		so whoever you bought the domain from
2011-11-14T08:57:00.000Z	Johannes1	gloomer	No I got  that part. But I need it to point to a nameserver ... but I haven't set up a nameserver. How do I do that on my end, I mean.
