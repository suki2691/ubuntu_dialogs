2008-09-08T17:18:00.000Z	stuporglue	Rajec	: I used it that way for about a month with no issues
2008-09-08T17:21:00.000Z	Rajec	stuporglue	Great. So I need just one  free partiction which will be formatted and even dual booting will be solved automaticly?
2008-09-08T17:31:00.000Z	Rajec	stuporglue	I heard that ubuntu is slower when using wubi(because of IO operations)
