2010-02-26T21:17:00.000Z	icorbett		I have a test kubuntu system that i upgraded from karmic to lucid and the ps2 keyboard/touchpoint and usb mouse don't seem to be playing nice... confirmed it with the alpha3 live cd... any thoughts on chasing that one down?
2010-02-26T21:18:00.000Z	sbts	icorbett	what are they doing wrong?
2010-02-26T21:19:00.000Z	icorbett		i see... okay, never been to #ubuntu+1 before... ill check that channel
2010-02-26T21:20:00.000Z	icorbett	sbts	if you are interested look in #ubuntu+1 soon
