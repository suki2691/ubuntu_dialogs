2008-04-28T12:03:00.000Z	whirlybird20		I have an aspire 5050 laptop with an sd/xd card reader but ubuntu isn't detecting it. What should I do?
2008-04-28T12:03:00.000Z	otto-away	whirlybird20	is it internally connected to usb?
2008-04-28T12:11:00.000Z	otto-away	whirlybird20	I am seeing little tidbits relating to it when I google search it
2008-04-28T12:11:00.000Z	otto-away	whirlybird20	but I don't really see a solution...maybe try leaving a post on the ubuntu forums
