2006-01-20T13:49:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		like devide frequency by 2
2006-01-20T13:49:00.000Z	thegladiator	lsuactiafner	frequency etc can be adjusted using xmms I believe
2006-01-20T13:50:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	thegladiator	: seems it only lowers the db output per frequency, doesnt actually remodulate it
