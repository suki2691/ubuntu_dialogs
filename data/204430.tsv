2007-12-22T12:16:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Dr_willis_	sudo -i, not sudo -s please
2007-12-22T12:19:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Dr_willis_	tail ~/.bash_history; sudo -s; some_random_commands; exit; tail ~/.bash_history
2007-12-22T12:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	HymnToLife	 given all the shells i seem to have open. My history always seems rather useless.
