2009-05-19T00:32:00.000Z	grendian		tcpdump -w tcpdump.log gives me packet data.. how to i get it to dump the output it shows to a log file.. only success i have had is tcpdump > tcpdump.log, but this doesn't actually dump to the log until i kill the command. anyone know tcpdump? better place to ask?
