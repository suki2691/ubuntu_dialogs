2006-03-03T15:25:00.000Z	Morclye		I'm running on ATI Radeon x850 and I have ATI drivers installed, but I can't get the resolution that I want, modding xorg.conf doesn't help, how can I have a custom resolution ?
2006-03-03T15:25:00.000Z	Morclye		I can choose 1280x1024 , but not 1280x960 that I need
