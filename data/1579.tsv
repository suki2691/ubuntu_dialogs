2012-08-14T11:12:00.000Z	IdleOne	hack3r	10.10 is no longer supported, we can't help you. This channel does not support 10.10 anymore.
2012-08-14T11:13:00.000Z	hack3r	IdleOne	you support 10.04 but not 10.10? that makes no sense....
2012-08-14T11:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	hack3r	sure it does. 10.04 is a LTS. 10.10 does not receive any security updates.
