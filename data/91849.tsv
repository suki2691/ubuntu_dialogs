2009-10-17T15:06:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499		I have two computers, one I use, and one mom uses, I want to make it so that while my mom is or isn't using the computer I can access files from it where ever my first computer gets internet, how do I do this?]
2009-10-17T15:07:00.000Z	lucent	ShapeShifter499	no easy solution that I can think of
2009-10-17T15:07:00.000Z	lucent	ShapeShifter499	the techie way would be to configure SSH access into there
2009-10-17T16:15:00.000Z	lucent	ShapeShifter499	static or not static IP is not easy to know
