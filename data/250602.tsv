2005-04-11T10:39:00.000Z	zerokarmaleft	Dreamer3	is there a ubuntu-specific packaging guide?  or is following the debian guidelines good enough
2005-04-11T10:39:00.000Z	Dreamer3	zerokarmaleft	well, i don't know that you can just get a package into ubuntu like that... you'd have to go through the debian process
2005-04-11T10:39:00.000Z	Dreamer3	zerokarmaleft	unless your special and working on something non-debianish for main
