Checking back in Windows 7, I have the entirety of my second Hard Drive as "Unallocated."  There is no option to format, merely to add a volume.  This is correct, right?  But it still doesn't like it.
2010-10-14T08:07:00.000Z	KM0201	Snowflame	how big is the unallocated space
2010-10-14T08:08:00.000Z	KM0201	Snowflame	but how much did you unallocate for Linux?.. i'm guessing you don't want to give Linux 800gb?(assuming Windows is using 200gb)
