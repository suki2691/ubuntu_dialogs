2008-08-02T08:05:00.000Z	simon14		i'm trying to boot off a live cd, it goes to the loading screen, then it just throws me to the command line
2008-08-02T08:06:00.000Z	RequinB4	simon14	- do you get a busybox or a terminal?
2008-08-02T08:08:00.000Z	RequinB4	simon14	- then do as ManualOverDozer8 said - startx, if that fails try /etc/init.d/gdm start
