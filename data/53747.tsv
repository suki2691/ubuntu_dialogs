2009-12-01T06:00:00.000Z	squircle	ikus060	you got the name right, an index
2009-12-01T06:01:00.000Z	squircle	ikus060	a glossary lists the word definitions, an index is a list with page references
2009-12-01T06:02:00.000Z	ikus060	squircle	ok .. then it's an index.  Anybody know a good tool to create this kind of index ?
