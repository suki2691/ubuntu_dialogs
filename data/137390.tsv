2007-04-22T06:29:00.000Z	dunstabulos_	ozymandias	ubuntu does not enable the root account as standard, the user you created is setup to have sudo rights
2007-04-22T06:29:00.000Z	ozymandias	dunstabulos_	sudo su just failed when i had no password to enter
2007-04-22T06:30:00.000Z	dunstabulos_	ozymandias	you should use your accounts password
