2008-09-30T10:23:00.000Z	izinucs	mike-solidus	the newer kernel is part of the next release.. you could install  it now if you like.. not the kernel alone but the entire distro.. but first ask in #ubuntu+1 and see if anyone know if it addresses your issue..
2008-09-30T10:23:00.000Z	mike-solidus		Itracy_: I have a problem with its support of my intel ICH10 sata controller card, I got ubuntu to install by changing the mode to ahci but i can't leave it as that because windows no longer recognizes it when it is in ahci mode. I've poked around a little and found that ICH10 support has recently been added into the kernel and is availabe in intel_ata.ko and uhci. But i cant find an answer past that
