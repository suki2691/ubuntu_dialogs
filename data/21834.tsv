2011-01-03T01:42:00.000Z	h-dee		Hi...I reinstalled Ubuntu today. I used to see GRUB boot menu with Kernels and recovery mode options. Now I don't see, and it just boots up Ubuntu when I power on my laptop. What if I need to boot to recovery mode someday. Anyway to get that list back? Or alternate option to boot to recovery in case required?
