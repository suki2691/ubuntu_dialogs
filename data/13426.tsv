In any case, my Ubuntu install broke after this, leaving my windows running with some faults regarding CD/DVD reading (I kind of hoped for this, since it is not unusual after doing big changes), thus I decided to reinstall everything. The thing is, whenever I try to boot from a Ubuntu 11.04 USB install, I ...

I've already searched for similar errors and it doesn't seem like anyone's ever had the exact same problem. Any ideas?
