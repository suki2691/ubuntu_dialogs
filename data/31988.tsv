2010-05-13T07:25:00.000Z	reya2276		Does anyone know the reason why GIMP 2.6 keeps crashing on Lucid 64-bit? I got a Quad Core and 8GB or DDR3 RAM, so I got enough power for this app
2010-05-13T07:27:00.000Z	CountDuckula	reya2276	have you tried launching gimp from command line and see what messages (if any) appear?
2010-05-13T07:29:00.000Z	reya2276	CountDuckula	oh no I have not tried that, let me see what I get
2010-05-13T07:30:00.000Z	reya2276	CountDuckula	no errors or any msg
