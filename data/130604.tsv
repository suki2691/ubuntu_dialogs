2007-07-12T06:09:00.000Z	alecwh		 I'm having a problem, and one I can't pin. I have fairly good system specs (see @ http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29596/), and my computer just doesn't seem... up to par. I spent lots of money on this thing, and it doesn't feel like I'm getting it's potential. Compiz lags up, and Duel monitors lags up EVERYTHING. I bought two screens back in my vista days, and now, I can't use one of them because it lags up my system, bad. I want to use Compiz, too..
