When looking through the docs it mentions that alps hardware doesn't work properly without applying a kernel patch.. it gives me the patch file to run but i'm not sure how to run it.. have never done kernel patching before
2005-04-01T13:26:00.000Z	CarinArr		so could anyone possibly help me or give me a hint of where to find more info about it
2005-04-01T13:26:00.000Z	Nermal	CarinArr	install the kernel source
