2010-11-24T01:13:00.000Z	Prowler_x1		I am a linux newbie interested Ubuntu. Should I jump into 32 bit or 64 bit
2010-11-24T01:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Prowler_x1	32bit is more supported by 3rd party companies. If you have a tonne of ram or intend to encode video/audio a lot then 64bit can help
2010-11-24T01:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Prowler_x1	obviously you'll need a 64bit cpu to run 64bit os
2010-11-24T01:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Prowler_x1	its identical, all appsin the repos are compile for both and configs are the same
