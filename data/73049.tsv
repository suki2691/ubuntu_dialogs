2009-07-23T02:43:00.000Z	arand	BellinXFelon	if using rm, the -f flag will do that, but what is it you are deleting?
2009-07-23T02:45:00.000Z	BellinXFelon	arand	: its a folder and the error message says Failed to copy "/home/chris/9 milla" to "trash:///9%20milla".Failed to open "/home/chris/.local/share/Trash/info/9 milla.trashinfo" for writing.
