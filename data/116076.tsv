2007-12-19T15:19:00.000Z	ima-n00b	macogw	it was either linux running it or windows... kinda had no choice lol
2007-12-19T15:19:00.000Z	macogw	ima-n00b	that kinda fall under the category of "things most sysadmins dont want to try" and is kinda the reason if you're migrating a setup from windows to linux, you do the servers first
2007-12-19T15:21:00.000Z	ima-n00b	macogw	my ideal would be to have one windows server handling authentication and group policy for clients and linux handling all the intranet/file/dhcp/whatever else i can throw into it serving
