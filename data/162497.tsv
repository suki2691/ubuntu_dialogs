2007-05-21T05:16:00.000Z	mbb		is there an archive site for planet.ubuntu? lots of good stuff there, goes away too fast some weeks...
2007-05-21T05:16:00.000Z	PriceChild	mbb	click on the links on the right for links to blogs which archive it
2007-05-21T05:21:00.000Z	mbb	PriceChild	do you mean click for the individual blogs? I'm hoping to find an archive of the whole planet. 1. for when I'm away for a few days, and 2. when I fail to bookmark something neat.
