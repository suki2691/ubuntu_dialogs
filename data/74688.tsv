2009-05-14T08:03:00.000Z	Roasted	koshari	- I have Vista/Ubuntu as dual boot. So I'm trying to fire up Vista virtually. I've never done this before. At the virtual hard disk screen where I create a new virtual machine, I'm just not sure which one I'm to select... Boot Hard Disk Primary Master?
2009-05-14T08:06:00.000Z	Roasted	koshari	pablo_ - I have Vista/Ubuntu dual booting already. I'm just trying to fire up Virtualbox to get Vista booted. I just don't know which hard drive setting I am to choose.
