2007-12-03T10:03:00.000Z	soldats	revilodraw	i believe its been reported so i assume it will if you like the player id suggest reporting it again
2007-12-03T10:07:00.000Z	soldats	revilodraw	hmm i will have to check in on that, your best bet is to use the one that plays the best for now. in the future it may be resolved, vlc has always worked for thogh
