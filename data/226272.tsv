2009-05-10T01:28:00.000Z	Hydrant		does anyone know of an easy utility for managing DNS entries ?
2009-05-10T01:29:00.000Z	Muelli	Hydrant	nano, vi or emacs *SCNR*
2009-05-10T01:29:00.000Z	Muelli	Hydrant	check powerdns. but tinydns is *really* simple
2009-05-10T01:30:00.000Z	Muelli	Hydrant	don't use bind. Use something sane. Like djbdns. It has a really simple configfile format
