2007-08-02T08:39:00.000Z	telseth		sorry to just break in here: i have an x1550 and the install goes great until it gets to about 95% through the kernel loading, then it tries to switch graphic modes... and dies, the video itself seems to be "ghosted", but i can get to different terminals with root access.  i cannot edit xorg.conf, becuase since its on the cd its write only... is there any other way i can install? text only?
