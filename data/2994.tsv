2012-05-19T17:44:00.000Z	solderblob	c0deMaster	could you be more specific?
2012-05-19T17:45:00.000Z	solderblob	c0deMaster	you mean like http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man8/sandbox.8.html
2012-05-19T17:46:00.000Z	c0deMaster	solderblob	if there is backdoor or malicious code somewhere but I don't know which files so I need to open or execute applications without infecting my system
