2008-08-28T03:57:00.000Z	infexion		I am having a problem with being able to access a mounted sd card
2008-08-28T03:58:00.000Z	infexion		well the drive mounts but it keeps saying that I cannot access it because root is the owner
2008-08-28T03:58:00.000Z	infexion		and I can access it if I use root permissions but I was wondering if there is a way to change the permissions
2008-08-28T03:58:00.000Z	debCarlos	infexion	Maybe with chmod
