2006-02-20T10:40:00.000Z	SCI4All		I just shot myself in the foot, and deleted my site-packages directory. I tried reinstalling python but that didn't help. Any ideas?
2006-02-20T10:42:00.000Z	anto9us	SCI4All	site-packages are where all the python extras are stored, try re-installing the other packages with python in the name
2006-02-20T10:43:00.000Z	SCI4All	anto9us	it's a new install so not much was there. I tried to reinstall python-apt with apt-get --reinstall install python-apt.  Nothing
2006-02-20T10:44:00.000Z	anto9us	SCI4All	use synaptic and get it to list broken packages, that may help
