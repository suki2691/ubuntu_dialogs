2008-06-12T00:52:00.000Z	HardDisk	kat_aq	you can with Mercury Messenger, but it's still a bit unstable if you use the 14 protocol
2008-06-12T00:53:00.000Z	kat_aq	HardDisk	so not with emesene or aMSN
2008-06-12T00:53:00.000Z	HardDisk	kat_aq	emesene no, aMSN I doubt it. try mercury it does work with yahoo but buggy.
