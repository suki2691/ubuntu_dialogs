2011-08-27T04:54:00.000Z	Polah	NewUser	Most drives don't require special drivers
2011-08-27T04:55:00.000Z	NewUser	Polah	network card and audio aren-t working
2011-08-27T04:56:00.000Z	Polah	NewUser	I can't help you set them up but someone else might be able to. Perhaps take a search around for "<model name> linux drivers"
