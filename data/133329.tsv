2007-05-25T09:46:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	dsnyders	mount -o loop isofile dirtomounto
2007-05-25T09:47:00.000Z	dsnyders	Sh3r1ff	that just mounts it.  I want to boot it without going to the store, buying blank media, etc.
2007-05-25T09:48:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	dsnyders	afraid you will have to go to the store then ;)
