2009-11-02T09:35:00.000Z	metainfinity		i just installed 9.1 and i was wondering whether it's normal for my laptop's fan to have been running nonstop ever since i turned it on
2009-11-02T09:35:00.000Z	metainfinity		anyone?
2009-11-02T09:35:00.000Z	motoh	metainfinity	are your proprietary drivers if any activated?
