2008-11-19T04:30:00.000Z	MTecknology	Tr3y-	that ctrl-alt-del error comes up after he tried to boot into vista from the grub menu
2008-11-19T04:30:00.000Z	MTecknology	Tr3y-	that's about all we have so far
2008-11-19T04:31:00.000Z	MTecknology	Tr3y-	no - it seems like his vista boot is screwed up inside vista itself
