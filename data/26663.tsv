2010-09-10T23:54:00.000Z	glebihan	maxflax	you're quite right, since xorg.conf is not used by default, it seems that nobody really knows where the configuration is stored
2010-09-10T23:55:00.000Z	maxflax	glebihan	- yes, seems like thats the case. buggs me tons thou and it's almost becomming an obession to find out
