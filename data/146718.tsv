2007-03-21T09:47:00.000Z	secion8	Madpilot	nothing that I would know of, I used it just minutes before to remove and reinstall cinelerra
2007-03-21T09:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	secion8	I'm not an apt-get expert (I haven't managed to break it yet - nothing teaches you about an app like having to fix it!), but someone should be able to help  you - just be patient
