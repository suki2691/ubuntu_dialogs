2009-11-27T15:47:00.000Z	DaDa|Urka		How can i realize x-forwarding with a different user?? When i do sudo -u otheruser x-App i got: X11 connection rejected because of wrong authentication.
2009-11-27T15:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	DaDa|Urka	why not make the initial connection as the other user?

2009-11-27T15:51:00.000Z	DaDa|Urka	ActionParsnip1	because iam not the other user (hence i haven't his pw)
