2012-07-31T15:55:00.000Z	stealthii		Hi there.  I come from a redhat background.  I was wondering if there was something similar to the tool 'repoview' for debian/ubuntu repositories?
2012-07-31T15:55:00.000Z	theadmin	stealthii	Tell us what it does?
2012-07-31T15:58:00.000Z	stealthii	theadmin	cfhowlett: I am more interested in the package-specific pages, which can show the changes between release versions (normally generated from the changelog in the spec)
2012-07-31T15:59:00.000Z	theadmin	stealthii	Still no idea, sorry -- I don't know anything APT and HTML related
