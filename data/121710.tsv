2007-09-16T06:53:00.000Z	Ar_Pharazon		Hmm... Actually, does anyone know how I can backup my programs/files/config files to another partition prior to wiping and reinstalling ubuntu?
2007-09-16T06:54:00.000Z	Ar_Pharazon		Please, anyone? Just tell me what/how to backup and I'll leave you in peace. I'm positive it will solve all my problems. Err. For the time being.

2007-09-16T06:55:00.000Z	Ar_Pharazon	terlmann	Ok, so what about programs I've installed? Netbeans and opera are the ones that matter really.
