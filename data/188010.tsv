2011-04-04T23:09:00.000Z	||arifaX		I need a second cups-pdf printer with its own configuration file. How can I achieve this? I need 2 differend postprocessing scripts to work.
2011-04-04T23:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	||arifaX	just add it in System>Admin...>Printers?
2011-04-04T23:11:00.000Z	||arifaX	erUSUL	I am on Ubuntu Server without desktop. I think the result will be a second printer using the same config-file which won't work
2011-04-04T23:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	||arifaX	use the cups web interface? really dunno ask in #cups
