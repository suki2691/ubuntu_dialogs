2010-08-18T08:31:00.000Z	C_Okie		Hi I have a question I tried to lookup and look around on but couldn't find exactly what I wanted to do.... Can you mount a drive in windows so the C:Documents and Settings\ stuff is stored in a seperate partition
2010-08-18T08:31:00.000Z	C_Okie		I am kinda stuck on this before I setup the rest of windows to then setup ubuntu
2010-08-18T08:33:00.000Z	pbarros	C_Okie	 I'm confused why you would wan't it set that way before you can install ubuntu
2010-08-18T08:35:00.000Z	pbarros	C_Okie	 you can mount to a windows ntfs partition just fine in Ubuntu.
