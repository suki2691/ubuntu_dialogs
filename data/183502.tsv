2007-06-04T06:45:00.000Z	Pelo	fogwar	7.04 is the current release go for that
2007-06-04T06:45:00.000Z	fogwar	liquiddoom	yes, personal, but what am i losing by not choosing one or other?
2007-06-04T06:46:00.000Z	Pelo	fogwar	unlike windows ubuntu has a new and improved release every 6 months,  hence the multiple versions available
