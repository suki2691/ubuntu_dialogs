2011-04-02T23:03:00.000Z	duper		how would i go about configuring Ubuntu9 to use a 10.04.2 (LTS) repository for package updates with APT? i.e. I installed an older version of the distribution originally, but I still want the latest userland utilities without re-installing (I've already upgraded the kernel.)
2011-04-02T23:04:00.000Z	tensorpudding	duper	upgrade to 10.04?
2011-04-02T23:06:00.000Z	tensorpudding	duper	9.10 won't be supported forever, whereas 10.04 is an LTS release and thus will be supported for three years
2011-04-02T23:38:00.000Z	duper	tensorpudding	i understand that.. i just don't want to have to re-install due to downtime since this is Ubuntu server
