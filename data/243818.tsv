2005-11-25T08:05:00.000Z	struggler	smo	cramfsprogs has mkcramfs and cramfsck, but no way I can see to extract
2005-11-25T08:07:00.000Z	smo	struggler	rather deceptively, it's the -x option to cramfsck
2005-11-25T08:07:00.000Z	struggler	smo	rather?  looks like a whole lot deceptive to me...Thanks for your time, I appreciate it.
