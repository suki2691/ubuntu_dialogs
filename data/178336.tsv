2008-05-13T22:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	JediMaster	that was just covered, it is a known problem and they are now working on it
2008-05-13T22:00:00.000Z	JediMaster	Jack_Sparrow	ta, just panicing a bit that if I log out I won't get my ssh session back (and the connection tends to drop the ssh session)
2008-05-13T22:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	JediMaster	ok
