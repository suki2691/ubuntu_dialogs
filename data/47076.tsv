2009-09-23T14:23:00.000Z	DXBLouie		i got an Acer Aspire Revo.. quite a nice machine.. ubuntu 9.04 running fine on it.. but the wireless drivers are giving me a headache :( ath5k works intermittently, connection is fine, but suddenly it gets stoned.. i can't reach any hosts, even the local gateway.. setting the rate to 1M helped a bit yesterday but not anymore.. and the built in madwifi drivers (ath_pci) causes the computer to crash (it simply freezes).. any help?
2009-09-23T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DXBLouie	could try the latest ath5k driver source and compile
2009-09-23T14:26:00.000Z	DXBLouie	ActionParsnip	link? i know google is my friend, but if you know an official link it would save me the trouble :)
