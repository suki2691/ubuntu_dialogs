2011-12-05T12:31:00.000Z	Milossh		hey; I have dell inspiron 5110(15R) and have serious cpu temp probs(97C when browsing). Is there a tool that actually works? Stupid BIOS doesn't show any power settings. some windows solutions mention cpu max should be turned down to ~70%, but I don't get that in ubuntu. What worries me is that this laptop is actually Ubuntu Certified, but I don't get any special tools for it, whatsoever

2011-12-05T12:32:00.000Z	Milossh	susundberg	well, if I close the lid(I'm using external monitor), it overheats within minutes
2011-12-05T12:34:00.000Z	susundberg	Milossh	ok check
