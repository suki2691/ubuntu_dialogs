2012-10-18T07:58:00.000Z	trigger_kill		If I install 12.04 now, and then upgrade when given the chance, will there be any diffrences to if i simply installed 12.10 directly?
2012-10-18T07:59:00.000Z	cfhowlett	trigger_kill	of course.  Do you really NEED 12.10?
2012-10-18T07:59:00.000Z	cfhowlett	trigger_kill	12.04 is Long Term Support good for 5 years.
2012-10-18T07:59:00.000Z	cfhowlett	trigger_kill	suggestion install 12.04. Stick with LTS only releases.  Next LTS will be 14.04
