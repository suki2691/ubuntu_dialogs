2009-08-20T05:08:00.000Z	yartiss		 Does anyone know how to find the original GID of the admin group?
2009-08-20T05:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	yartiss	assuming that I read the postinst script for the sudo package correctly, the GID is most likely 27
2009-08-20T05:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	yartiss	for me, the admin group is GID 109
