2008-01-30T04:09:00.000Z	Daenyth	pine	I'm using a smart boot manager floppy to boot the cdrom. I get to the first screen where I choose how to boot the livecd, and when I choose to start, it cuts power
2008-01-30T04:12:00.000Z	Daenyth	pine	could it be related to the hardware I have?
2008-01-30T04:17:00.000Z	pine	Daenyth	sorry pal., not very good with hardware stuff, but try another installation cd
