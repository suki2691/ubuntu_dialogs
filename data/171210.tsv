2006-08-12T08:44:00.000Z	zipper__	josh__	close to it, 7900gt, why do you ask?
2006-08-12T08:45:00.000Z	zipper__	josh__	so you had an ati card before plugging in your nvidia card?
2006-08-12T08:46:00.000Z	zipper__	josh__	thats the reason. Ati uses sucky drivers, nvidia uses less-sucky, but still not that good, drivers. They are different. Hang on a minute, and i'll find a link for a good guide on how to install the nvidia driver
