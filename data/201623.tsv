2006-03-11T10:55:00.000Z	jumpkick		I'm curious to know if anyone else running the ubuntu Zope 2.8.1 experinces deadlocks...
2006-03-11T10:57:00.000Z	bimberi	jumpkick	no, but my installation isn't under any load (yet)
2006-03-11T11:00:00.000Z	jumpkick	bimberi	I have been having a real bitch of a time even with like no load...  my problem looks like this (from someone else's ML post): http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope/2005-November/162801.html
2006-03-11T11:06:00.000Z	bimberi	jumpkick	eww, i'm sorry i don't know a lot that could help.  I believe you can use mod_rewrite or mod_proxy in apache so switching to the other method might be a workaround
