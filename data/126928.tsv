2007-12-23T22:40:00.000Z	zoe	KaZeR	that will give you the ubuntu-desktop functionality. you will, however, still be running the server install, which may not be the best for you
2007-12-23T22:40:00.000Z	KaZeR	zoe	then what's your advice? upgrade or reinstall?
2007-12-23T22:41:00.000Z	zoe	KaZeR	honestly, unless you need the server, I'd say reinstall
