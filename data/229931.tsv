2005-10-08T16:35:00.000Z	Thunderguy		If I got a CD together with: win32 codecs, instructions for sources.list, wineX precompiled, some programs, some manuals, some Video,Audio Libraries, Server Libraries, ClamAv, and most of the stuff aforementioned in the UbuntuGuide, Think I would have any legal problems distributing it With the Ubuntu Set?

2005-10-08T16:36:00.000Z	tristanmike	Thunderguy	you'd have to pay for the codecs that have licencing, or risk those people coming after you. After all, wouldn't this be the reason Ubuntu doesn't include it?
2005-10-08T16:38:00.000Z	tristanmike	Thunderguy	you may want to check out this thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=30147 for something along the lines of what you're looking for, I believe.
