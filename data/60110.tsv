2009-04-18T18:02:00.000Z	caesium_		Hi, I have two xscreens running (0 and 1), how can I send the output of one command (e.g. mplayer blabla.mpg) to the other screen( from the terminal)?

2009-04-18T18:07:00.000Z	caesium_	caesium_	you should use "Display=0.1 mplayer blabla.jpg", that will start mplayer on your other screen
