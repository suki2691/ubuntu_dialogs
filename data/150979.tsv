2007-12-11T23:35:00.000Z	hairulfr	johannes__	I've had horrible problems with my installing lately, for no apparent reason. My primary HD fried and I took me 3 hours to get the ubuntu install working. Weird. But it worked at last,
2007-12-11T23:38:00.000Z	johannes__	hairulfr	What did you do? Just keep on rebooting the LiveCD?
2007-12-11T23:40:00.000Z	hairulfr	johannes__	Well, that and then opening the comp up and opening the windows to make sure it wasn't too hot or anything, then disconnectiong every bit of hardware that I didn't need. Then it suddenly worked (except for xserver crashing on the original cd's, so had to use a home burnt on)
