2009-09-12T14:02:00.000Z	Logomachist		When I log into Ubuntu I get a blank desktop with a mouse cursor and my wallpaper and that's it. The panels don't appear and alt + F2 doesn't work. By pressing the help button I can get a help window to appear but it is stuck in the upper left hand corner of the screen with no menu or title bars; I can't move it around or resize it.

But even then the window decoration still doesn't appear. If I log in to another account the panels and window decorations do work. Thinking the problem might lie with my settings files I deleted user settings files such as .gnome and .gnome2 to no avail.
2009-09-12T14:02:00.000Z	Logomachist		So seems my problem is particular to one account but not tied to the user preferences. Any suggestions?
