2010-02-08T04:45:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy		I'm having issues with UNR 9.10 on my Aspire ONE - Whenever I unplug it from the wall it shuts down claiming the battery is discharged, but in 9.04UNR this did not happen
2010-02-08T04:46:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Dj_FlyBy	(this was suggested by someone else the other day) boot into the BIOS and try unplugging the power to see if the same thing happens, removed Ubuntu as a cause
2010-02-08T04:49:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	ZykoticK9	Ok I will try that and see what happens
2010-02-08T04:49:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	ZykoticK9	thanks
