2004-10-19T11:01:00.000Z	_Hiro_		I had xfs corruption and now muine nor tomboy works. I reinstalled every mono package but that doesn't help. Anybody any suggestions?
2004-10-19T11:01:00.000Z	_Hiro_		can I reinstall every supposedly installed package in some fashion?
2004-10-19T11:02:00.000Z	|trey|	_Hiro_	yes... select all packages, and mark them for reinstallation...
