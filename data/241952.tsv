2008-02-11T09:29:00.000Z	ben__		doesnt ubuntu 7.10 come packaged with samba? cause it seamed to me like someone was basically telling me eralier that i had to install it before sharing my files
2008-02-11T09:31:00.000Z	ben__		but i can already rightclick on a folder and select shared folders, then i can choose either SMB or NFS
2008-02-11T09:31:00.000Z	ben__		so do i still need to install something else?
2008-02-11T09:32:00.000Z	astro76	ben__	checking SMB will install the needed samba packages
