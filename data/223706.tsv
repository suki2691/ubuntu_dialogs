2005-09-20T14:03:00.000Z	transgress	GregAsche	can't really... that's a terminal thing... gnome-terminal allows you to right click and do it
2005-09-20T14:04:00.000Z	GregAsche	transgress	I use Gnome terminal, but is there a plugin or extension or something so that I can double click?
2005-09-20T14:04:00.000Z	transgress	GregAsche	umm not that i've ever seen.
