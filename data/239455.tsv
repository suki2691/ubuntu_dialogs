2006-03-21T12:50:00.000Z	LeeJunFan		no kidding, that's what I was thinking. And even if you were.

2006-03-21T12:52:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	jon_	frustration really. I've been beating my head over this trying to get a NFSboot to work, but nfs / won't mount in time because client system doesn't have portmapper on it.
