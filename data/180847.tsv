2006-10-01T11:33:00.000Z	_Spire_	ricky	try "apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree"
2006-10-01T11:35:00.000Z	_Spire_	ricky	hmmm... that's strange. It should work
2006-10-01T11:39:00.000Z	_Spire_	ricky	try uninstalling flash player, going to a site with a flash object, clicking on the "click here to install" thing and let it install. it should work
