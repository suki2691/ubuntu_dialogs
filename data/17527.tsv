I have gotten hold of a iMac G4 (the ugly lamp thing) and feel the urge to use ubuntu on it, but I cant even get it to boot the CD. I have tried holding down the C-key as instructed on the internets but it just checks for CD and then goes back to boot up osx. So is there anyone who think they can help me with this task?

2011-03-01T01:46:00.000Z	naimina	Mrokii	I am using the old 8.04.1
2011-03-01T01:46:00.000Z	Mrokii	naimina	I see.
