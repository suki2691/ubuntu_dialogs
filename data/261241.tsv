2005-01-24T08:51:00.000Z	kent	Linforcer	oh, you mean "the ./" thing?  its becaus the current directory is not in $PATH, so you have to realy tell the system the thing you want to run is in the current directory
2005-01-24T08:52:00.000Z	kent	Linforcer	so the "./" is only to tell the system that the program to run is in the current command, it can be done as a normal user aswell. For example, if you write your own script/program and have it in /home/user/  then you change to that directory and run it with ./myprogram.se
