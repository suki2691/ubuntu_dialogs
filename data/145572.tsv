2007-02-16T08:08:00.000Z	mehtodize		i need help getting permission to write some files.... for some reason sudo, gksudo, and gksu aren't working
2007-02-16T08:08:00.000Z	Flannel	mehtodize	the partition you're writing to is mounted read-only, most likely
2007-02-16T08:11:00.000Z	mehtodize	Flannel	any ideas on how to make the mount not read only?
2007-02-16T08:11:00.000Z	Flannel	mehtodize	that depends on the partition
