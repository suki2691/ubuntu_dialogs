2011-03-20T21:52:00.000Z	dnivra	HelloWorld321	yeah it's the only way. but best to stick to the repository version IMO. you're welcome to download 3.6 and compile it too.
2011-03-20T21:52:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	dnivra	you recommend going with 3.5 ?
2011-03-20T21:53:00.000Z	dnivra	HelloWorld321	i do not know about eclipse 3.5 vs 3.6 but mostly it's recommended to stick to the version from the official repository,
