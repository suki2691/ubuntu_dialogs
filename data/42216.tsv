2010-02-01T08:10:00.000Z	MrBananas		hey guys im like a total linux noob. my original goal was to install multiple linux os
2010-02-01T08:10:00.000Z	MrBananas		<MrBananas> i started with suse. the installation would  crash after it completed then i owuldnt be able to load into anything. i solved this by disabling ACPI. that fixed the installation issue and allowed me to use suse. I then made another partition to start to install ubuntu 9.10. Well the installation kept failing and restarting my computer at random times, til i discovered i yet again had to disable ACPI.
2010-02-01T08:10:00.000Z	MrBananas		<MrBananas> Well the installation was a success, but thereafter, i was not able to load into ubuntu. I tried from GRUB to load into the recovery mode, which i guess is like safe mode, but it would say, loading ACPI processor 0, fail. Loading ACPI processor 1, fail, and so on for my four cores. Any idea??
