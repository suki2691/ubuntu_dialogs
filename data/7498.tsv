2011-11-26T01:23:00.000Z	theadmin	w1res	Search for "Startup Applications" in the dash
2011-11-26T01:24:00.000Z	w1res	theadmin	that's what I used to start the script, but I just put it in my user directory, is that ok?
2011-11-26T01:24:00.000Z	theadmin	w1res	Sure, though a better place is ~/bin or ~/.local/bin
