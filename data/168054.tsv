2008-04-26T04:07:00.000Z	jharr		Anyone know how to use the .gvfs stuff? I have various shares mounted, but none show up in the .gvfs folder...
2008-04-26T04:08:00.000Z	Pelo	jharr	your own local partitons get mounted as gvfs as I understand it for you to share with others,  check in system monitor on the last tab
