2010-05-20T08:14:00.000Z	holmser		quick command line question.  say I have a whole tree of folders that contain .r01, .r02 , etc.. files.  would rm -r *.r* remove just those rar files?
2010-05-20T08:16:00.000Z	holmser		or would this possibly be better: rm -r *.r??
2010-05-20T08:16:00.000Z	holmser		I don't want to lose all my files, just the rars
2010-05-20T08:17:00.000Z	robin0800	holmser	*.rar would be better
