2012-09-18T10:07:00.000Z	Potter		Hej, can you guys help me with a little problem? i've recently installed Ubuntu on my HP, but now i can't find the files that were on the PC before?
2012-09-18T10:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Potter	did you delete the partitions or format the file systems
2012-09-18T10:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Potter	ok, so mount the partition with the fils on
2012-09-18T10:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Potter	please tell me the exact problem instead of using words like "wind the partition" as that means nothing
