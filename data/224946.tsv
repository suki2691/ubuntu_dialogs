2005-12-25T15:14:00.000Z	Jemt		I need a program that can record what is happening on my screen. Actually I want it to record a running screensaver. Is that possible?
2005-12-25T15:15:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	Jemt	I've looked into that. I would try googling - its too complex a question for IRC. From what i found out its more than just apt-get'ing an app!
2005-12-25T15:15:00.000Z	Jemt	nicholaspaul	Ok. Thanks
2005-12-25T15:16:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	Jemt	 I know i say 'GOOGLE" alot, but honestly its youre best bet.
