2005-05-02T14:38:00.000Z	drspin	syntaxis	every package in ubuntu-base && ubuntu-devel... that would take me a while
2005-05-02T14:38:00.000Z	syntaxis	drspin	why? You can specify multiple packages at a time
2005-05-02T14:45:00.000Z	drspin	syntaxis	multiple packaged to the tune of every package in ubuntu-base and ubuntu-desktop?? that would take forever (I don't have X running so I can't copy and past)
