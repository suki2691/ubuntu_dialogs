2010-10-03T17:28:00.000Z	chrissharp123	MuNk`	you can run synergy from the command line and make it log at different levels - haven't done it in a while, but man synergy will help :-)
2010-10-03T17:29:00.000Z	chrissharp123	MuNk`	I run 10.04 with synergy on several computers with no issue, FYI
2010-10-03T17:30:00.000Z	chrissharp123	MuNk`	I'm just making the point that it's not a problem with 10.04, per se
