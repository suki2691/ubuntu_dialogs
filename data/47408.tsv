2011-09-03T23:27:00.000Z	pdtpatrick		How do you install a new theme in ubuntu 11.10 ? Do you have to manually install it in /usr/share?  Because the current appearance allows now way of installing themese

2011-09-03T23:29:00.000Z	pdtpatrick	theadmin	right .. but in 11.10 it seems they give you a list and you either choose from that or you're S.O.L at least on my attempts. Have you tried it on 11.10 and that worked for you ?
