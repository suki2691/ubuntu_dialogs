2006-04-11T08:51:00.000Z	ibob63		my installation of suse linux crashed - so i'm moving over to ubuntu. I have recovered my home directory but don't know how to restore the evolution mail. Can anyone tell me how to do this?
2006-04-11T08:53:00.000Z	ibob63		should I click through this and then overwrite the new files with the old?
2006-04-11T08:55:00.000Z	nickrud	ibob63	the account information for evolution is not kept in .evolution, but under .gconf Just how they connect up with the stuff under .evolution is another question...
2006-04-11T08:57:00.000Z	ibob63	nickrud	that will explain it then.
