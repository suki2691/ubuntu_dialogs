2008-06-26T08:26:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa		well i am having problems getting windows to install on HDD2 because it needs to put files in the MBR on my ubuntu drive(HDD1) and i went to windows IRC channel and the best they could give me is install windows first
2008-06-26T08:28:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa		i already have ubuntu on HDD1 and dont wanna reinstall ubuntu
