2010-06-15T21:36:00.000Z	tucemiux	dae1	what machine are you using?  Sounds like a known bug, if you havent been to the forums I suggest you familiarize yourself with it, it looks like there is a bug specific only to your machine, most likely youll a lot of information there, like me for example, im one unlucky one and my sound card works flaky with ubuntu on my laptop
