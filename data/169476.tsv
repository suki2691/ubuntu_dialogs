2006-08-27T12:48:00.000Z	gnomefreak	leme	livecd has a gui installer
2006-08-27T12:48:00.000Z	gnomefreak	leme	the alternative is the debian installer
2006-08-27T13:00:00.000Z	leme	gnomefreak	does the alternative cd solves any problems with grafics on the installation? in the live cd i have to start in safe grafics mode. i tried vga=771 but it don't works.
