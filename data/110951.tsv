2011-08-12T00:23:00.000Z	maheanuu		I am having a problem trying to upload photos to a critique site, I have followed their instructions to the letter and the upload indicator runs and then it drops me out on their page but my photos are not there...  This has been going on for days and now they are asking me to try another browser, I am using firefox and have no problems with any other site  could someone tell me if there is a better browser than firefox for Ubuntu
