2006-01-15T12:26:00.000Z	slew		i have a windows partition on this drive, and it shows up in ubuntu as an icon on the desktop. im not able to see the contents of this partition, how do i remove the icon?
2006-01-15T12:26:00.000Z	trappist	slew	you'd rather remove the icon, or fix permissions on the drive?
2006-01-15T12:27:00.000Z	slew	trappist	id rather just not have the icon at all
