2007-05-17T05:27:00.000Z	Luke9511		is there anyway i can get 3d and direct rendering on my ati card without using fglrx?
2007-05-17T05:27:00.000Z	kdub432	Luke9511	are you trying to run beryl?
2007-05-17T05:33:00.000Z	kdub432	Luke9511	even if you wanted to use the ati drivers, getting rid of fglrx isnt a trivial task
2007-05-17T05:35:00.000Z	kdub432	Luke9511	i imagine you've ran glxgears in a terminal to see if your 3d is working?
