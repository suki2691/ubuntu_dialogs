2007-07-16T16:22:00.000Z	pushpop		Hello All, I have an issue with my Ubuntu machine I just recently installed it.  I loaded my desktop with the desired applications I want to use, then I rebooted... since reboot my system runs like crap it takes several seconds for an app to launch, it is a beefy system with 4gb of memory and a dual core.  Could anyone help me
