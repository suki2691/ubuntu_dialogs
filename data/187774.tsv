2010-08-07T02:55:00.000Z	Alazare		reason being isadora (mints version) of lucid lynx seems to have some problems one being it wont let me install nvidia's drivers from there site and there at 255.44 atm and the ones in the repo are 195....
2010-08-07T02:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Alazare	mint is not ubuntu, they have differences
2010-08-07T02:56:00.000Z	ikonia	Alazare	ok, in that case you can assume it will be the same as mint
2010-08-07T02:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Alazare	I'd say you will have the same issues you have with mints hardy distro, Hardy is very old and obsoleted
