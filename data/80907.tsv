2008-10-31T22:26:00.000Z	outbackwifi	death_	ubuntu-desktop is only a metapackage
2008-10-31T22:27:00.000Z	death_	outbackwifi	I didn't know that, but when I remove it gnome starts acting all weird and x wont run at startup, the user login stops working too
2008-10-31T22:36:00.000Z	death_	outbackwifi	so why does ubuntu has to come with this slightly uncompatible pulseaudio, I was better off dealing with alsa(which it was a nightmare sometimes) I believe it shouldn't come as default
