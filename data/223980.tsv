2005-08-24T10:16:00.000Z	gmoore		 this is a really stupid question, but i'm new to linux and i'm pretty lost. i'm trying to set up proftpd and i'm confused about how to make users (not configuring the .conf file... i mean in my o/s). all ftp servers seem to function this way but i can't find a good explaination; they all assume you already know this (i guess it's a pretty 'core' thing). help? :(
2005-08-24T10:17:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	gmoore	do you know about adduser?
2005-08-24T10:17:00.000Z	gmoore	EasterSunshine	i saw the command earlier, i don't know how to use it or the ramifications of it
2005-08-24T10:18:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	gmoore	try `man adduser`
