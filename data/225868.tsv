2005-12-10T11:47:00.000Z	m4v1s		i am still having trouble resizing my ntfs partition to fit ubuntu on my laptop
2005-12-10T11:47:00.000Z	m4v1s		im currently on the live cd version
2005-12-10T11:49:00.000Z	m4v1s		should i resize the ntfs partition with the livecd tool or use the install disk?
2005-12-10T11:49:00.000Z	trappist	m4v1s	either is fine.  use windows to defrag it first though.
