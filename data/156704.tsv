2008-01-22T04:25:00.000Z	riotkittie	creature	open a term and type sudo update-menus
2008-01-22T04:26:00.000Z	creature	riotkittie	Yes, that's how I do it by hand. As I say, I want it to do it automatically after I install some softwrae.
2008-01-22T04:30:00.000Z	creature	riotkittie	I would like to unwonk it.
