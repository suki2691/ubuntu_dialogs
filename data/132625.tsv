2009-04-24T09:36:00.000Z	cweagans	archy	I did, but it was a clean install instead of an upgrade....I just downloaded the disk via Bit Torrent
2009-04-24T09:37:00.000Z	cweagans	archy	yeah...not much you can do about it....the Ubuntu mirrors are all getting raped by the hordes of people wanting to upgrade =P
2009-04-24T09:38:00.000Z	cweagans	archy	there was an article on Slashdot a few days ago about using apt-p2p to upgrade your install via Bit Torrent. You might give that a shot
