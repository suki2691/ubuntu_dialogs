2009-04-25T00:56:00.000Z	XPS_M1330		Is it normal that GParted takes several hours to resize a FAT32 partition from 160GB to 500GB ?
2009-04-25T00:58:00.000Z	XPS_M1330		is there a better tool than GParted to resize a large FAT32 partition?
2009-04-25T00:59:00.000Z	ompaul	XPS_M1330	got a second disk - back up your data and to a straight forward format methinks resizing upwards is a total pain of an operation (mostly because of that how well that file system is documented)]#
2009-04-25T01:00:00.000Z	XPS_M1330	ompaul	 thanks for the suggestion but I don't have enough space on my other discs for all that data
