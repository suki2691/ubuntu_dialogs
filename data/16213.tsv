2011-04-28T20:04:00.000Z	[Soma]		someone please help me, I'm going insane with unity. how do I change that the app-launcher on the left is NOT auto-hide but constantly visible so it doesn't take me ages to switch between apps. also, how do I enable alt-tabbing between apps, and how -- for the love of god -- do I customise the top navbar (the part with the time etc in it)

2011-04-28T20:07:00.000Z	[Soma]	lugkhast	but what annoys me deeply is that first I have to navigate the pointer to the top-left, then the launcher pops out, and then I still have to select the app I wanna switch too. I wanna be able to click on it instantly. but thanks, I'm installing ccsm!
