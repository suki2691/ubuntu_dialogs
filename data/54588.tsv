2009-10-02T09:07:00.000Z	intok		Why can't I get this damn usb headset to work in 9.04 whe it has worked out of box with every previous ubuntu?
2009-10-02T09:08:00.000Z	jasmuz	intok	did you check what via it uses for sound? ALSA, Pulseaudio or OSS? 9.04 is very inclusive with PA, and that could be the difference

2009-10-02T09:11:00.000Z	jasmuz	intok	that seems bad... don't have a clue how to help there.. don't have one myself
