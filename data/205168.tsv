2006-07-28T16:56:00.000Z	dli	hyphenated	why does apt-proxy uses more bandwidth?
2006-07-28T16:57:00.000Z	hyphenated	dli	it doesn't.
2006-07-28T16:57:00.000Z	hyphenated	dli	it's for controlling updates though. so you make sure that only the updates you want to distribute on your network are on the 'proxy' machines
