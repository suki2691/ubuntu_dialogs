2004-10-06T12:09:00.000Z	bagpuss	martink	yeah...but you surely wouldn't use a secure password for bugzilla
2004-10-06T12:11:00.000Z	martink	bagpuss	next guess: because of the sabdfl's past? ;)
2004-10-06T12:12:00.000Z	bagpuss	martink	that sounds far more likely. Although given his past, it's strange that the ssl cert and the hostname don't match :)  (presumably that's just not been gotten around to yet)
