2010-09-05T20:48:00.000Z	Phil_B		hey all...I'm thinking of formatting my Acer Aspire One ZG5 and switching to Ubuntu.  Is there anything I need to know, or is it easier to just install 10.04 without formatting?
2010-09-05T20:49:00.000Z	Phil_B		I'm dual booting from a USB stick right now, but if it's easy enough I'd like to format my HD and just install 10.04.
