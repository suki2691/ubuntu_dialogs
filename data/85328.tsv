2008-07-19T09:06:00.000Z	aent		hey.... I'm trying to setup vmware-server on my server, and I'm trying to understand the networking setup... I have a server have many static IP addresses on there (i.e. eth0:0-eth0:30), and I want to assign one to a vmware server... do I use bridged or NAT?
2008-07-19T09:07:00.000Z	aent		so how do I assign which one the bridged one takes?
2008-07-19T09:07:00.000Z	superfirelord42	aent	if you want to set up to use a certine interaface, you want bridged...
2008-07-19T09:08:00.000Z	superfirelord42	aent	not sure on that... it should be in the vmware manuals on net... they may be able to help you more on the vmware channel... (i think we have one)
