2010-08-22T23:02:00.000Z	Javi_Sep		could anyone help me with a broadcom wireless question?
2010-08-22T23:04:00.000Z	Javi_Sep		ok, well: I've got a broadcom based card , bcm4312, and everybody is using the broadcom sta drivers from the hardware drivers window, but that driver doesn't work for me, instead of I'm using b43. Is it normal?
