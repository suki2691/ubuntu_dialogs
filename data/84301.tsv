2011-06-29T05:16:00.000Z	Berto		Hi - is there a way to go directly from 10.04 to 11.04?
2011-06-29T05:16:00.000Z	szal	Berto	yes, reinstall
2011-06-29T05:22:00.000Z	szal	Berto	unless that's a CRT, that's pretty pointless, since everything that's not the native resolution looks like cr*p on a flat screen
