2007-02-11T14:26:00.000Z	unop	JessicaFL	 did you want to have two sessions running at the same time?
2007-02-11T14:26:00.000Z	JessicaFL	commoner	oh! ok, I thought I had to do more than that
2007-02-11T14:27:00.000Z	JessicaFL	commoner	then how do you switch between them? (or is it just doing switch user back and forth?)  can you do alt+f7,f8 ?
2007-02-11T14:27:00.000Z	unop	JessicaFL	 you can have another session within your current one by running this command - gdmflexiserver -xnest
