2011-06-20T18:45:00.000Z	Guest44668		I have a question, why don't I have drop-down menus in any of my application windows?  Is that a normal thing for the latest Ubuntu?
2011-06-20T18:45:00.000Z	Guest44668		I never had amac, and I can't find them at all.
2011-06-20T18:46:00.000Z	Guest44668		Is there a way to change it back?
