2009-08-02T05:46:00.000Z	PaulChater		I have another question. :) Why are 80% of IRC users complete and utter pricks? :)
2009-08-02T05:46:00.000Z	PaulChater		Especially on So called 'support' channels. Lmfao.
2009-08-02T05:47:00.000Z	MK13	PaulChater	well because the other %20 keep calling them pricks (j/k)
