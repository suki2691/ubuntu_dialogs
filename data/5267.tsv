2012-07-23T04:43:00.000Z	Stealthy		virtualblackness, it gives me a terminal and then the same "frozen install window" I had earlier. Is there any way I can know if the partioning is over yet? If it' s over yet I guess I can just turn off my computer and start the installation all over again without loosing any data...

2012-07-23T04:46:00.000Z	L3top	Stealthy	if it does not resolve itself in 30 minutes I would go ahead...
