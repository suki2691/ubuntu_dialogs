2005-09-20T05:19:00.000Z	Codeus		Well so first I was on the install cd for 5.10, and it would not let me resize my NTFS partition, so then I used the livecd hoping that I could just load up gparted to resize the NTFS partition, but when I loaded up gparted the system froze up!
2005-09-20T05:19:00.000Z	Codeus		how should I go about resizing ntfs!
2005-09-20T05:20:00.000Z	nalioth	Codeus	in the install cd, hit "ctrl-alt-f3" for a new login and use regular parted
2005-09-20T05:20:00.000Z	nalioth	Codeus	read up on parted before use and *disclaimer: back up all the data you want to keep b4 doing any disc operations*
