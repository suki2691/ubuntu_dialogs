2005-08-07T09:20:00.000Z	equex		one more thing (only slightly kde related this time). i have a problem with my dvdrom. it used to work properly (i installed the ubuntu dvd with it too), now suddenly it cant read any DVD roms, though it CAN read normal CD's. It detects that i insert a DVD too, though i get "Malformed URL" from Konquerer if i try to access it. any idea ?
