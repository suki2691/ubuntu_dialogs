2012-09-04T10:34:00.000Z	fikibok		I have a windows installation right now and I want to dual boot a linux distro with it. I will try Debian but it's kinda hard to get debian to dual boot with windows so can I use ubuntu's "install ubuntu alongside windows" option to install ubuntu first, then delete it and install debian on that partition?
