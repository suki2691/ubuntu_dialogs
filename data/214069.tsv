2009-12-29T13:28:00.000Z	bbalajirao		I cant enable visual effects on my Ubuntu 9.10. It keeps saying "Desktop effects could not be enabled". How do I solve this?
2009-12-29T13:29:00.000Z	airtonix	bbalajirao	install drivers for your video card
2009-12-29T13:30:00.000Z	airtonix	bbalajirao	also you didn't mention what video card you have .
2009-12-29T13:30:00.000Z	airtonix	bbalajirao	ok you don't bother trying to enable desktop effects then.
