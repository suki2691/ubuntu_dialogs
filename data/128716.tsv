2007-09-11T15:17:00.000Z	CoasterMaster		I have a missing operating system error upon boot after installing Ubuntu (and getting rid of Windows).  Any ideas?
2007-09-11T15:17:00.000Z	bascule	CoasterMaster	cause windows is missing?
2007-09-11T15:18:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	bascule	but Ubuntu is installed
2007-09-11T15:18:00.000Z	bascule	CoasterMaster	I don't know grub well but that might upset it, missing an OS that is listed
