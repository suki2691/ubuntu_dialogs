2012-07-30T22:58:00.000Z	yacc	dr_willis	my fantec USB dock seems not to :(
2012-07-30T23:03:00.000Z	yacc	dr_willis	and still my daughter PC took roughly 4 hours (split out over some weeks) till it's sound worked, just because an Audio driver detects hardware and claims that it works does not mean that you get sound out of plugs ;)
