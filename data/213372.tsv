2005-10-13T13:17:00.000Z	IRCMonkey_		i have a quick question= i have a 80 GB hd with a 5GB partition. i went into setup (ubuntu) and selected the 5Gb partition to be my ubuntu partition. if i go along with the partitioning, will it format my WHOLE 80GB's or only the 5GB partition?
2005-10-13T13:19:00.000Z	IRCMonkey_		anyone?
2005-10-13T13:20:00.000Z	IRCMonkey_		ok so ubuntu will install there?
