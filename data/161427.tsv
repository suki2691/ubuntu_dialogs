2007-08-10T08:59:00.000Z	Juno		because I just locked myself out of root
2007-08-10T08:59:00.000Z	dxdt	Juno	is none by default, use sudo
2007-08-10T09:04:00.000Z	dxdt	Juno	are you trying to install the driver from Nvidia's website?  Because you shouldn't do that until you've tried to install it with sudo aptitude install nvidia-glx
