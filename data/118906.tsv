2008-08-14T17:27:00.000Z	ac1		hi i'l be installing a lock down tool for my internetshop Im selecting between sabayon and pessulus which is more stable and easy to use?
2008-08-14T17:27:00.000Z	bazhang	ac1	why ask about those distros in the ubuntu channel?
2008-08-14T17:28:00.000Z	bazhang	ac1	this is the wrong place to ask for sabayon
2008-08-14T17:29:00.000Z	bazhang	ac1	looks like pessulus from the name :)
