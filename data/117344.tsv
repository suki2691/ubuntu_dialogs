2008-02-27T21:20:00.000Z	baxter_kylie		Hi. Can anyone please tell me the application that handles /preferences/ for gutsy's remote desktop settings?
2008-02-27T21:22:00.000Z	geirha	baxter_kylie	System -> Preferences -> Login-screen (or something along those lines)
2008-02-27T21:23:00.000Z	baxter_kylie	geirha	I'm on ssh (with X forwarded), I need the application name not it's gui location.
