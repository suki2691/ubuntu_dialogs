2007-02-12T13:27:00.000Z	windmill		Hello anyone know why when I plug my usb mp3 player in it gets mounted at read-only?? it works fine under fedora?
2007-02-12T13:27:00.000Z	kitche	windmill	your user doesn't have permission to write to it that's why
2007-02-12T13:28:00.000Z	windmill	kitche	I tried it as root (sudo bash) and it told me the same
2007-02-12T13:28:00.000Z	windmill	kitche	and why wouldn't my user have permission?
