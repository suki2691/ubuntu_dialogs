2012-07-25T03:19:00.000Z	zymaster		Hey I have a question thats a little off topic. I am considering buying a rack server and running ubuntu server, but I know nothing about rack servers. I am curious besides the server itself, what else would I need to buy like casing, cooling, etc

2012-07-25T03:20:00.000Z	zymaster		Thanks
