2011-12-05T07:00:00.000Z	mrpink57	l1nr007	cd into the folder
2011-12-05T07:02:00.000Z	l1nr007	mrpink57	in fact i'm going to use it in a bash script.. isn't there any other way to do it... like passing a parameter to wget or something
2011-12-05T07:02:00.000Z	mrpink57	l1nr007	I would check the man page on wget
