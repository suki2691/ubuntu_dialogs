2011-07-29T08:25:00.000Z	gerzel		I'm wondering if anyone can help me.  Whenever I use a JAVA program that works with sound I get bad distortion.  I'm using the Sun JRE and 11.04 ubuntu.  Anyone know why the two are not playing nice?
2011-07-29T08:25:00.000Z	gerzel		I'd really appreciate any help I could get
2011-07-29T08:27:00.000Z	gerzel		Confezzor: I have sun jdk installed as well.  JRE is required for the JDK
2011-07-29T08:28:00.000Z	confezzor	gerzel	if you have the open JDK you shouldn't have the need to have the JRE from what i know i could be wrong
