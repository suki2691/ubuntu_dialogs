2008-04-15T08:37:00.000Z	auronoir		I need a bit of help... I couldn't find this info in the man pages.. I'm trying to mirror the contents of a directory to my ftp server but I don't want it to create the same source directory name.. I want only the contents of it uploaded (files and subfolders).. What command should I type for that?
2008-04-15T08:39:00.000Z	Pelo	auronoir	have you looked into rsync ?
2008-04-15T08:40:00.000Z	auronoir	Pelo	mmm no.. i had been using lftp till now.. it's not possible to do it without it?
2008-04-15T08:41:00.000Z	Pelo	auronoir	I was reading about rsync earlier to do someting else,  it's to sync folder and files over a network
