2007-07-11T05:42:00.000Z	LucianIndy	Russian_	Settings->Preferences->Colors . . . im assuming your using xchat
2007-07-11T05:42:00.000Z	LucianIndy	Russian_	the option for colors will be in a listbox under preferences. . . its not an actual menu item
2007-07-11T05:43:00.000Z	LucianIndy	Russian_	i have no idea why they are 'blacked-out'. I can see mine just fine. #Ubuntu, any thoughts?
