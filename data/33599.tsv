2010-06-02T14:31:00.000Z	JediMaster		I need a good reason to stay with firefox as my primary browser, as chrome/chromium is far faster and more stable with flash under Linux, I'm a web developer and I tend to have 40+ tabs open, and firefox 3.6 is better than previous version but still slow compared to chrome.
2010-06-02T14:33:00.000Z	Galerien	JediMaster	all the add-on...
2010-06-02T14:34:00.000Z	JediMaster	Galerien	chrome has a lot of addons, the main ones on FF I use are firebug (chrome has google developer tools), webmaster tools (there's an official chrome port), and XMarks (also has an official chrome port)
2010-06-02T14:36:00.000Z	Galerien	JediMaster	then change :D
