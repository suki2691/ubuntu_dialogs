2012-06-23T01:53:00.000Z	Etale	BluesKaj	I've started using IRC again for the first time in more than a decade very recently. Back when I used it, it was a very different place. I thought I should give the ol' newsgroups a revisit. See what happened to that world...
2012-06-23T01:55:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Etale	yeah newsgroups are still around I think , but I haven't used them for 10 yrs either
2012-06-23T01:55:00.000Z	Etale	BluesKaj	I've been seeing the word "usenet" a lot recently. Is it synonymous with newsgroups?
