2006-07-20T14:58:00.000Z	Zooliegsm		i played a movie first time....with totem i got very pixelized pics,and with etc kaffeine or gxine i got smooth and nice pics like in windows....whats the problem with totem?

2006-07-20T14:59:00.000Z	Ribs	Zooliegsm	You can switch to the xine backend by installing the totem-xine package. The other two media players you mentioned also use a xine backend
2006-07-20T15:00:00.000Z	Ribs	Zooliegsm	maybe. I'm not an expert on gstreamer, so I can't help you with that one personally.
