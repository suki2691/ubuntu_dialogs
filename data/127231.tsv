2007-07-23T06:30:00.000Z	linxeh	WGGMk	it depends where you live
2007-07-23T06:30:00.000Z	WGGMk	linxeh	again my experience is from customers (people needed wireless lan's setup, people that pay me to do it, IE: average people)
2007-07-23T06:33:00.000Z	linxeh	WGGMk	sure, but some areas are prone to WEP attacks. If the client has WPA compatible hardware, it is the obvious choice. I live in an affluent part of the UK, and I've seen people hijack my WEP network
