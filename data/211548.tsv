2010-09-12T09:45:00.000Z	dcajacob		Thanks, edbian.
2010-09-12T09:47:00.000Z	dcajacob		Oh, edbian.  I know this works for machines on a LAN, but I am referring to a laptop on wireless.  I think it doesn't connect until the user logs in - therefore no SSH access.  Is that correct and if so, is there a way around it?
