2007-09-07T08:15:00.000Z	odai		I'm on feisty, and when I use gparted to try to edit my partition, it won't allow me to do anything, all of the options are grayed out....and help?
2007-09-07T08:16:00.000Z	cdm10	odai	run gparted from a livecd, not from your system.
2007-09-07T08:16:00.000Z	cdm10	odai	download the gparted livecd from the gparted site, I find it more reliable than gparted from the Ubuntu livecd
2007-09-07T08:16:00.000Z	odai	cdm10	alright thanks
