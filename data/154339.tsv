2009-11-06T21:10:00.000Z	Jack`s		hi.. I have a problem. After I upgraded to Ubuntu Karmic, I have an error up there .. Hard Disk Drive 80 GB - There are many defects sectors. What does it means ?
2009-11-06T21:10:00.000Z	Halitech	Jack`s	defective sectors normally indicate a dying drive
2009-11-06T21:12:00.000Z	Jack`s	icarus-c	this error wasn't BEFORE upgrading .. just now. What should I do ?
2009-11-06T21:12:00.000Z	Halitech	Jack`s	get a copy of the Ulitmate boot cd and check the drive
