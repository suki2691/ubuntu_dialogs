2006-03-22T16:26:00.000Z	mrj		Can anyone explain how to change the name it shows for one of my mounted partitions?  All are normal (size then the word Volume,) except for one that says "r($course);"
2006-03-22T16:26:00.000Z	h36sa	mrj	samba share?
2006-03-22T16:26:00.000Z	h36sa	mrj	check the bottom of /etc/samba/smb.conf
2006-03-22T16:26:00.000Z	mrj	h36sa	 Nope, just a regular partition (vfat)
