2006-12-08T10:16:00.000Z	majestik		is there an app to add users?
2006-12-08T10:17:00.000Z	quantux	majestik	you almost have it, it's "adduser"
2006-12-08T10:18:00.000Z	quantux		or system->administration->users and groups
2006-12-08T10:18:00.000Z	majestik	quantux	im guessing is a gui right, cuz there is an app in cli that is useradd
