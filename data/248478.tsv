2005-04-18T06:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cavedive1	AFAIK it's about the same, with a few minor differences like "server" instead of "custom"
2005-04-18T06:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic		it still isn't graphical if that's what you mean...
2005-04-18T06:57:00.000Z	cavedive1	thoreauputic	no i understand it won't ba graphical, and I don't want that either,
