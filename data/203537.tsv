2006-02-22T16:13:00.000Z	YaST		so Does anyone has a 915GM graphic card working fine on ubuntu?
2006-02-22T16:15:00.000Z	daiver	YaST	Do you have the ATI card in there?
2006-02-22T16:15:00.000Z	daiver	YaST	I have the 915PM with the ATI x600 card and all I can say is that it is a headache.
2006-02-22T16:17:00.000Z	daiver	YaST	I've yet to find a distro that works on this laptop.  Im usually stuck with vesa and running 1024x768 on a 17" WUXGA :(
