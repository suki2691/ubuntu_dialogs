2008-10-31T13:50:00.000Z	pthagonal1		Sorry to repeat myself- will give this one more go: I'm planning on doing a fresh desktop install of 8.10 and want to do software mirroring across a pair of SATA drives. To save me downloading the wrong iso, can anyone recommend normal/alternative/dvd as the one I should get?

2008-10-31T13:53:00.000Z	pthagonal1	ActionParsnip	yes, may as well use that last 0.5GB !
