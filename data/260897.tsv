2012-08-09T12:25:00.000Z	chuck	redbox	i have always been able to see folders from windows in linux..but never folders in linux from windows. I dont think windows understands the filesystem
2012-08-09T12:26:00.000Z	chuck	redbox	i dont have any experience with windows
2012-08-09T12:27:00.000Z	chuck	redbox	i have used it maybe for a short time..but not for anything like that
