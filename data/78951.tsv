2009-05-16T00:41:00.000Z	glitsj16	lucax	when i looked into gnome-globalmenu some time ago, it specifically mentioned firefox as one of the applications that were not supported ... have you checked if that is now supported by gnome-globalmenu ?

2009-05-16T00:45:00.000Z	glitsj16	lucax	i see ... perhaps the gtk-fix for firefox relies on the removal of firefox-branding, can't say i know for a fact
