2008-04-30T10:06:00.000Z	z0rz		I just did an apt-get upgrade and now my machine won't boot.  It stalls at the Ubuntu loading screen for a while and then instead of going into gdm it says BusyBox v1.1.3 and then (initramfs) _
2008-04-30T10:06:00.000Z	z0rz		I think it has something to do with all-generic-ide flag not being in grub.. but I can't get it to boot with that either...
2008-04-30T10:06:00.000Z	z0rz		Anyone?
2008-04-30T10:06:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	z0rz	someone will help you...
