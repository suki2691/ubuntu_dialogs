2008-11-18T00:19:00.000Z	Onion		Ok, Q: I just installed Ubuntu 8.04 and updated about 300 packages totaling 270 MB. Do i need to update the distribution to version 8.10 get the latest features of ubuntu or is the magic in the packages that I updated?
2008-11-18T00:19:00.000Z	fde	Onion	you would need to explicitly upgrade to 8.10 to get the latest updates... yes
2008-11-18T00:22:00.000Z	Onion	fde	How do I know what fun I'm missing out on but not upgrading to 8.10 i.e. how do i know what features are package specific and which are distribution specific?
2008-11-18T00:23:00.000Z	fde	Onion	umm... very little is distro specific... if you enable backports, you'll basically get everything but the low level upgrades though
