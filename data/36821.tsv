2010-04-22T05:26:00.000Z	Typos_King	janelle	   I'm just saying hehe, updater beware
2010-04-22T05:30:00.000Z	janelle	Typos_King	try this instead" yes Janelle you can, but it's not recommended" see same thing, but much less rude
2010-04-22T05:31:00.000Z	Typos_King	janelle	   yes you can, but often times the update doesn't go as smooth as one wishes, and thus is better to back yourself up before doing so, for backups, is better to have them and no need them  than need them and not have them, sooo, is recommended  instead to do full-install and your chances of success are greater :)
