2009-01-18T14:14:00.000Z	rww	cMad	virtualbox works fine with the 64-bit kernel for me =/
2009-01-18T14:15:00.000Z	cMad	rww	Whats that kernel called? Could I switch to it if i'm running generic now?
2009-01-18T14:17:00.000Z	rww	cMad	there're two different versions of most packages in the Ubuntu repositories, including the -generic kernel. One version is 32-bit, one is 64-bit. You're not supposed to mix them, no.
