I downloaded the warcraft 3 demo, and all my graphics are messed up in the game (sound isn't that great either...). all the images and stuff in the game are just basically a bunch of lines that have the color of that image. I can barely tell what's what. The screen size also goes down. heres the link to the screenshot- http://www.opmstech.org/t_tmp/screenshot.png
