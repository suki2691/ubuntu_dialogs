2008-09-01T01:10:00.000Z	Radux_	danbhfive	, already have a few of those
2008-09-01T01:13:00.000Z	danbhfive	Radux_	mk.  I just figure that they are better than just storing your passes on a flash drive.  You thought it would make it so that only the holder of the drive could use it, but thats not true.  Its still anyone who knows the pass, flash in hand or not
2008-09-01T01:13:00.000Z	Radux_	danbhfive	sure, lol. I've decided its easier just to remember a sentance and change it once a week or something. like 'clowns have fangs during the night'  then ' sunset comes just after sunrise' could be the week after'
