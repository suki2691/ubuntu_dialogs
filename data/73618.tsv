2009-07-09T05:13:00.000Z	pumpkinseed		Running Ubuntu 9.04 64bit with a Sound Blaster Audigy 4. Sound works fine, but when I plug my headphones in my sound is quiet as a whisper (after I raise my volume meter to 100%). I have scoured all sound settings and everything is at 100%. Can anyone help?

2009-07-09T05:15:00.000Z	pumpkinseed	magnetron	- could you elaborate
