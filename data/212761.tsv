2006-06-02T07:36:00.000Z	gnomefreak	cef	how much you know about -proxies?
2006-06-02T07:36:00.000Z	cef	gnomefreak	a little. that error could be caused by connecting to a proxy (setup in apt.conf or apt.conf.d)
2006-06-02T07:37:00.000Z	cef	gnomefreak	would help more, but I've got a security update to address.. back soon
