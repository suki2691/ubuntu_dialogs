2011-02-17T23:30:00.000Z	ershad		I accidently 'quit' the volume control icon in the top panel. I tried adding 'gnome-volume-control-applet' to start up, it comes, but it doesn't have the rhythmbox control in it, could you help me to get back the old volume control?
2011-02-17T23:30:00.000Z	stianhj	ershad	did you remove the indicator-applet?
2011-02-17T23:31:00.000Z	ershad	stianhj	that's it :) thank you so much :)
2011-02-17T23:32:00.000Z	stianhj	ershad	no problem
