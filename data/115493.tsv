2007-10-23T03:28:00.000Z	Evanlec_	FrankQ	flash is solved in gutsy, piece of cake now
2007-10-23T03:29:00.000Z	FrankQ	Evanlec_	That's quite cool, thanks. I installed 32-bit on purpose to avoid the weird dependency hell for flash I had, and then I heard about it being allegedly solved ;-)
2007-10-23T03:29:00.000Z	Evanlec_	FrankQ	yea, the flash package on gutsy installs and configures nspluginwrapper for you automatically, its quite easy
