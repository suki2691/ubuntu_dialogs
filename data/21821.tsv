2010-12-28T02:06:00.000Z	GaryD		hello all. does anyone know why mplayer goes black after a few minutes? i have the video output set on x11.
2010-12-28T02:07:00.000Z	dotblank	GaryD	perhaps its the screensaver?
2010-12-28T02:08:00.000Z	dotblank	GaryD	maybe it some other power option.. If you can't figure that out and you are sure its mplayer not any other part try asking #mplayer
2010-12-28T02:09:00.000Z	GaryD	dotblank	thanks. i will check all settings and then consult #mplayer.
