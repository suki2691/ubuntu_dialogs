2010-05-04T03:48:00.000Z	donri		Can I have dual monitors with compiz? Ubuntu Lucid, ATI Technologies Inc RS482 [Radeon Xpress 200M]
2010-05-04T03:49:00.000Z	GeekSquid	donri	nope, I have that card and I can tell you once you enable the second monitor compiz will not work, unless you have it setup to mirror screens
2010-05-04T03:50:00.000Z	donri	GeekSquid	I have the same, but I'm wondering if there's something one can do about it (like xinerama or whatever).
2010-05-04T03:52:00.000Z	GeekSquid	donri	I have tried, ... major limitation of cheap video cards, I don't see a way to get dual vid + 3D/OpenGL working on the 200m
