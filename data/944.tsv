2012-10-09T08:50:00.000Z	LedHed	Respite212	other mounts work fine. I think its because the DM-multipath runs and creates the device maps after fstab is processed
2012-10-09T08:53:00.000Z	Respite212	LedHed	you might want to ask again then, because I am not 100% sure how fstab is processed or if it is even possible to get multipaths to run before fstab.
