2012-04-06T18:13:00.000Z	L3mce		I guess it still would.
2012-04-06T18:13:00.000Z	zykotick9	L3mce	/var/log - xorg.conf doesn't "usually" matter for the log
2012-10-03T02:59:00.000Z	zykotick9	L3mce	i think grub-fix or something like that is recommended these days.  chroot instructions are NO LONGER on the grub2 wiki page :(..
