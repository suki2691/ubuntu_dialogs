2007-11-03T20:43:00.000Z	cidwel		I have a question. Whats the best driver to use with a GeForce 8800 GTS in xorg? The restricted and automatic driver, the nv driver from the Nvidia web or what? I used both with successful result and when I restart the computer, the configuration fails switching back to VESA failsafe settings. What driver must use or, what's the problem here? Thanks
