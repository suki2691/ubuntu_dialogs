2012-04-30T17:04:00.000Z	mn_		Hi guys! :D I was just upgrading to 12.04 and the install botched. It had been sitting at the same spot for about two days so I unplugged it and let it run out of battery. Now, the system won't work. I have a liveCD to use to help fix it, but I have NO IDEA what to do or even where to start. Would someone PLEASE help me?

2012-04-30T17:06:00.000Z	mn_	kx	I can't clean install. I'm pretty technically proficient. I know this is how it can be from time to time, but that's fine with me. Do you have any constructive suggestions?
2012-04-30T17:08:00.000Z	kx	mn_	that was the most constructive suggeston you'll get. starting off with admitting you dont know where to start, i did you a favor. if you want to go through the process, boot to livecd, chroot into your old installation and use dpkg-reconfigure -a, apt-get -f install and dpkg -i to get your half installation attempted to work. when that fails (and it will) do the clean install
