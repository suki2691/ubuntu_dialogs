2007-08-02T12:54:00.000Z	GamingX		I uninstalled Ubuntume but it was messy, and now I get all sorts of errors. How do I get back the default settings for ubuntu?
2007-08-02T12:55:00.000Z	Flannel	GamingX	did you --purge all the things in ubuntume?
2007-08-02T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	GamingX	Try reinstalling ubuntu-desktop
2007-08-02T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	GamingX	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
