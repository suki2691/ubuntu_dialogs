2008-05-07T02:00:00.000Z	orionr		hey guys i am having a little problem
2008-05-07T02:00:00.000Z	orionr		I am running 8.04 and i have an nvidia card running dual screens. Before i could just run nvidia-settings and set everything up. Now it seems that i no longer have the command nvidia-settings any ideas?
2008-05-07T02:01:00.000Z	pioto	orionr	sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings
2008-05-07T02:01:00.000Z	pioto	orionr	yeah... it should be installed when they install the drivers, imho
