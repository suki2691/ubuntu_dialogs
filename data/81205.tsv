2008-12-03T18:51:00.000Z	PeskyJ		ps shows that gnome-screensaver with a child task of siporgraph -r is still running, if that helps
2008-12-03T18:53:00.000Z	PeskyJ		is it possible that mouse/keyboard input has just been disabled somehow? I notice caps-lock and num-lock on the local keyboard doesn't change the lights state
2008-12-03T18:55:00.000Z	PeskyJ		is it safe to kill the screensaver?
2008-12-03T18:55:00.000Z	Neaai	PeskyJ	I'd guess it's fine.
