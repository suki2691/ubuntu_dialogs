2010-05-01T18:06:00.000Z	dancallo		anyone else have to resort to a clean install instead of upgrade from 9.10?
2010-05-01T18:06:00.000Z	ziroday	dancallo	that is only normally required if you've installed a bunch of stuff from external repo's/ppa and/or compiled a bunch of stuff from source
2010-05-01T18:07:00.000Z	ziroday	dancallo	oh, you can always switch servers or just download the alternate CD over bittorrent and upgrade from that
