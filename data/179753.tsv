2010-09-18T02:27:00.000Z	Icehole		I need some help concerning an overwritten map in sauerbraten.
2010-09-18T02:28:00.000Z	Icehole		I accidentally saved over a map I was making and need to know how to use the .BAK file to recover it.
2010-09-18T02:29:00.000Z	jrib	Icehole	it's likely the same file but renamed to have .BAK at the end
