2009-01-25T19:22:00.000Z	stefg	arvernes	kernel versions won't change in a given ubuntu release. hardy will always have a 2.6.24 kernel,
2009-01-25T19:23:00.000Z	arvernes	stefg	ok, thank you
2009-01-25T19:23:00.000Z	stefg	arvernes	maybe the drivers get backported... and if you really need it you can still try to build your own (newer) kernel on hardy
