2007-08-17T15:45:00.000Z	somerandomguy12		And before anyone asks, yes, I do have w32codecs
2007-08-17T15:45:00.000Z	nickrud	somerandomguy12	you can try vlc
2007-08-17T15:46:00.000Z	somerandomguy12	nickrud	yeah, it plays in MPlayer. I was just hoping to make totem play it since that's what seems to be used for generating thumbnails.
