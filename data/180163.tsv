2009-08-04T16:55:00.000Z	blackbeard		i am on ubuntu. then i decided to try fluxbox. i installed it and logged it, edited the menus and keys etc it was all fun. but whenever i launch nautilus (dont have any other file manager )  i get the gnome menus in flux box and i have to hit the power button to alt and then power up again. any solutions on this?
2009-08-04T16:56:00.000Z	jrib	blackbeard	you mean the gnome panel starts up or what?
