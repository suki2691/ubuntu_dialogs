2009-08-10T20:33:00.000Z	okey666		I am having some strange trouble with my wired connection,
2009-08-10T20:33:00.000Z	okey666		When I installed I noticed it was in the network manager, and now, when I come back to use it, it is no longer there. ifconfig does not show it either, only ath0 lo and wifi0. I think the adapter is still working because my windows laptop appears to connect to it, but with a static ip.
2009-08-10T20:33:00.000Z	okey666		Can anyone help?
