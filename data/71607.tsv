2009-08-13T20:12:00.000Z	dalekleader		i hope someone can help me.  I had tried to setup a BIND9 dns on a server.  I later aborted it and removed the package.  now I cannot seem to get this server to connect to the web.  when I try to host google.com it appends my old domain name to the end and ofcourse fails.

2009-08-13T20:13:00.000Z	maco	dalekleader	maybe you need to purge it so the config files go away too?
2009-08-13T20:14:00.000Z	dalekleader	maco	i will try that
