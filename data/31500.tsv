2010-05-21T01:10:00.000Z	charles____		hello. i'm using windows vista (yes, don't laugh too much) and i'm trying to install ubuntu 9.10 via Wubi. i do not wish to use any other installation method, e.g. via .iso. i've tried many wubi EXEs and none seem to work for me
2010-05-21T01:10:00.000Z	charles____		any suggestions?

2010-05-21T01:14:00.000Z	charles____	sebsebseb	my wubi910.exe (i've tried various revisions) complains: "Can not download the metalink and therefore the ISO"
