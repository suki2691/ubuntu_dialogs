2010-12-19T00:14:00.000Z	MisterAnderson		Hi everyone, I've just installed ubuntu 10.10 on a vaio desktop and I don't know how to get the internet up and running, I asked in #ubuntu-us-mi and a person there thinks I have a problem because of a "Intel Pro/100VE ethernet card that isn't working correctly", can you help?
