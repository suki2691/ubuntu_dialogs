2006-10-12T10:25:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	joeCoT	Because it's very popular?
2006-10-12T10:26:00.000Z	joeCoT	ianmacgregor	i'm well aware. why doesn't it have a better connection? or, why doesn't it load-balance to, say, canada when it's overloaded?
2006-10-12T10:26:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	joeCoT	No idea, 'twas just a guess.
