2006-10-28T08:14:00.000Z	allad		I'm trying Edgy right now. And I've got a problem? My processor is constantly used at 50% even when I have not CPU intensive operation running
2006-10-28T08:15:00.000Z	allad		Does anyone has the same problem of resources leaking?
2006-10-28T08:16:00.000Z	chuckyp	allad	nope system has been up for a long time here.
