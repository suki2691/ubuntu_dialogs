2012-07-06T13:44:00.000Z	Wavelight		please give me your advice, I-am not using linux and I don-t understand the line comand, for a router it-s better for me to install and use PFSENSE or Ubuntu ?
2012-07-06T13:45:00.000Z	Wavelight		I understand that after installing Ubuntu server I need to make a lot of comand to secure the distribution, etc
