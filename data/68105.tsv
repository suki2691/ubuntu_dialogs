2009-01-21T09:16:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	digitalj	I've used Ubuntu for both so far, but if I ever have an architecture that Ubuntu doesn't support Debian would be used for that for sure.
2009-01-21T09:21:00.000Z	digitalj	tonyyarusso	you don't find Debian to run anymore stable or faster than Ubuntu in a server environment?
2009-01-21T09:24:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	digitalj	Not really.  When you're dealing with server stuff they're very similar anyway.  My main reason is pragmatic rather than technical anyway - I simply prefer the Ubuntu community.  Debian is at leas AS stable and fast; I just don't see a compelling enough reason to use it instead.  Would be comfortable doing so of course though.
