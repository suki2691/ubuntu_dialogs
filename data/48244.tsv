2011-11-24T02:23:00.000Z	rebecca		Hello I have a question. See, I want to change my password without logging in and I know that I need to go to recovery mode and type in passwd user but it always says this when I first enter: computer login: I forget how to escape this so it will let me change my password. So what do I type in in order to change my password before I type in passwd user?
