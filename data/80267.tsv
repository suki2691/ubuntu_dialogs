2008-09-15T05:43:00.000Z	kwame		Hi, in Fedora I had /etc/sysconfig/iptables file where I specified the iptables rules for my box, is there an equivalent in Ubuntu?
2008-09-15T05:44:00.000Z	Azazel-A2	kwame	you want to configure the iptables manually?
2008-09-15T05:45:00.000Z	kwame	Azazel-A2	well, yes, I mean, I know how to specify rules in the command line, but want to have a place where I have the rules when I reboot my box
2008-09-15T05:47:00.000Z	Azazel-A2	kwame	can't help ya.  I run firestarter on my boxes for ubuntu
