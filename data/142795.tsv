2009-06-23T02:17:00.000Z	sammy	bullgard4	no problem. finding the right package for a bug is hard work. the people assigned to watch new bugs for particular packages will help you figure out where your issue is actually occuring. no one likes bugs assigned to their package that don't have anything to do with them :)
