2009-08-01T15:54:00.000Z	Paschu		can ubuntu perfectly cooperate with an external hard drive which is formated in ntfs?
2009-08-01T15:54:00.000Z	allquixotic	Paschu	perfect is rarely associated with software, but ntfs-3g is very stable in my own experiences with it (I constantly use it to access my music on ntfs)
2009-08-01T15:59:00.000Z	allquixotic	Paschu	Well, every piece of software has had a problem at one point or another in its history; what can we do to convince you that ntfs-3g in Ubuntu (Especially the latest version of Ubuntu) is stable enough for you to use?
