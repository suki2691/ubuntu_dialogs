2009-06-16T21:39:00.000Z	DevilAsh		Hi everyone. I've been trying to set-up a proxy server (you know, do my part for Iran, and so I can get past some of my works firewalls, nonetheless!) but I haven't really been having any luck. I'm not really that 'advanced' with Linux just yet, but I'm learning. I've tried using Squid at the moment, but I'm utterly lost; I couldn't find an in-depth tutorial. Any help, suggestions or alternatives would be greatly appreciate
