2009-01-02T09:33:00.000Z	werLd-	exodus_ms	then he cannot spoof easily, so he will need to call isp and have new MAC address added so second computer can pull IP
2009-01-02T09:33:00.000Z	exodus_ms	werLd-	correct, but he doesnt even know what a router is, lets see if anything comes up from the ip addr I gave him
2009-01-02T09:34:00.000Z	exodus_ms	werLd-	see, he does have a router, just doesnt know any better
