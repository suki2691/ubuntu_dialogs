2010-06-15T00:49:00.000Z	k-rad		is awn not too bad of those docks of the ones that are out there ?  its an older one, i haven't kept up with the newer ones, i'm hoping i'm not missing one thats tons better
2010-06-15T00:50:00.000Z	SlidingHorn	k-rad	there are lots of good dock apps out there....take a look @ awn, cairo, wbar, & simdock
2010-06-15T00:50:00.000Z	k-rad	SlidingHorn	between Cairo and AWN, which would you choose ?
2010-06-15T00:52:00.000Z	SlidingHorn	k-rad	never tried cairo...had some issues with awn -- the only one i have real experience with and didn't have problems with was wbar...but I didn't really extensively research any of them
