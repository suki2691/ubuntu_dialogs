2006-05-15T10:41:00.000Z	Tobias382		Anyone know what package(s) need(s) to be installed for Audacious to have the AudioScrobbler Client feature enabled when compiling it from source?
2006-05-15T10:41:00.000Z	r0xoR	Tobias382	did you read any of documentation that came *with* the source yet?
2006-05-15T10:44:00.000Z	r0xoR	Tobias382	there should be a list of those --enable features around somewhere though
2006-05-15T10:44:00.000Z	r0xoR	Tobias382	they'll be *in* the ./configure file itself if nothing else
