2007-08-04T16:41:00.000Z	lunahood		did anyone can tell me how to find folder struktur like ../abc/def/...?
2007-08-04T05:08:00.000Z	kitche	lunahood	it;s probably /usr/bin/ruby
2007-08-04T05:12:00.000Z	lunahood	kitche	lockd: at /usr/bin/ruby is only a symbolic link that the IDE doesn't accept (doesn't show) and the hole directory /usr/lib/ruby doesn't contains the interpreter as it is (the selected directory is not a valid home for ruby SDK) :/
2007-08-04T05:18:00.000Z	lunahood	kitche	nickrud: did i need the ruby-dev package to get the interpreter executable ?
