For a reason or another, Ubuntu is using the system beep to do some sounds. for example in the terminal when i ctrl+z or backspace too much. or even in firefox when a find doesn't get a hit. is there a way to convert that sound effect from an internal beep to some sort of normal sound file?

2007-07-11T11:31:00.000Z	ChaoticMind	Pelo	regarding the beep thing, It got disabled, but I can't find a way to replace it with another sound effect. Is there a way you can think of? In any case, visual flash seems to be a fine alternative, so not that big of a deal....
