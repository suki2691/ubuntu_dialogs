2011-06-24T13:50:00.000Z	virgo		Why do i have to reboot my PC many times to get network connection with cable to router?
2011-06-24T13:51:00.000Z	virgo		else it sometimes shows cable not connected
2011-06-24T13:51:00.000Z	aliendude5300	virgo	you shouldn't. I just plug mine in and it works in seconds
2011-06-24T13:52:00.000Z	aliendude5300	virgo	not sure. might want to report that as a bug on launchpad.
