2008-12-06T07:12:00.000Z	gaelle		Hi! I have a problem installing intrepid... I'd like to use my hd free space to install but partition manager shows me 100% ubuntu on "after" disk preview... (I have w$ on first partition and 40G of free space after)
2008-12-06T07:13:00.000Z	mneptok	gaelle	don't choose "Guided, use entire disk" and choose "Guided, use free space"
2008-12-06T07:13:00.000Z	gaelle	mneptok	That's what I choosed but disk preview shows 100% ubuntu...
2008-12-06T07:15:00.000Z	mneptok	gaelle	you could just choose manual partitioning and do it yourself
