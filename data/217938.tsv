2005-12-21T08:15:00.000Z	john_		Hi I am a newbie to IRC, but I have a question I hope you can point me in the right direction.  How can I upgrade firefox to 1.5 on Ubuntu Breezy?  It is not available in Synaptic

2005-12-21T08:26:00.000Z	WebLOCH	john_	i didnt make fun of you, I gave you an answer based on the modicum of information you gave me, if you want to avoid prejudice then try harder.
