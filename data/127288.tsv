2007-08-26T07:51:00.000Z	genefitz	keithhhhh	yes, Ubuntu Studio is based in Feisty, I believe, so you should be able to run the same programs. Many have added the "studio" repos to their feisty system and such..

2007-08-26T07:53:00.000Z	genefitz	keithhhhh	it really depends on what you want to do with it. If you are really wanting to do some heavy recording and processing, studio may be the best way to go. For my studio, I run 64 Studio, but that is just a point of preference, my guitarist uses Ubuntu studio and swears by it..
