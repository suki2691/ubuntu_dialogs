2012-03-31T15:35:00.000Z	MrElendig	trinity_	you do NOT EVER want to log in as root using telnet
2012-03-31T15:35:00.000Z	MrElendig	trinity_	in fact, never use telnet, use ssh instead (and don't do root login, connect as normal user and use su/sudo to gain root instead)
2012-03-31T15:35:00.000Z	trinity_	MrElendig	: got your point we can do all with sudo but i want to ask is there any option
