2011-07-16T20:36:00.000Z	BDR	rhino__	I've already reset the router/modem combo. As for the Linux computer, I've been actively using it for about 2-3 days so I don't know where anything is - you'll have to tell me what you mean by '10.0.4' unless that's the IP I have to go to in Firefox, in which case I'll do that.
