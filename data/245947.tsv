2005-03-12T12:55:00.000Z	TomAraya		I'm a total newbie, I'm download a game demo right now, it is called. RH-demo.dmg.gz .. I've tried to download games before, and realized it was easier to use Synaptic. However, I couldn't find it in synaptic, so obviously the demo isn't on the repositories that I have. I'm downloading the file to my home directory. What would be the next step after that?
