2008-05-02T07:17:00.000Z	sparr		can someone explain to me why ubuntu does not have the same firefox package naming problem as debian?  both ship with patches, yes?
2008-05-02T07:18:00.000Z	Yaro	sparr	Ubuntu uses its own repositories. They could have simply fixed it themselves and publushed it.
2008-05-02T07:19:00.000Z	sparr	Yaro	i was under the impression that Mozilla forbids distributing custom binaries with the mozilla trademarks on them?  debian has their own repositories too.
2008-05-02T07:20:00.000Z	Yaro	sparr	Who said it was custom binaries? Wasn't this merely an issue with package names? Besides, I think the Mozilla foundation allows for custoom Firefoxes depending on circumstances... or... rather, customization modules, perhaps? I am not an expert on Mozilla's software. I'm just grateful it works well.
