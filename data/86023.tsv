2008-07-10T13:47:00.000Z	ne2k__		I have installed Ubuntu using Wubi on XPSP2 and have been using it happily for a month now. I want to move to a partition (I've heard there are some potential problems with wubi and windows updates -- plus, it's obviously a little bit slower) and retain all the data I have stored. is there an EASYPEASY way to do this? I can probably work out the not-so-easy-peasy way, but I just wondered if...
2008-07-10T13:47:00.000Z	ne2k__		...someone had already worked out an easypeasy way
2008-07-10T13:48:00.000Z	sn9_	ne2k__	is rsync easypeasy enough?
2008-07-10T13:48:00.000Z	ne2k__	sn9_	I was thinking more about the aspect of resizing my windows partition and not hosing XP
