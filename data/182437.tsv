2009-09-28T15:27:00.000Z	lizzzy		Hey, so I already have  C: and D: partitioned on my system and am gonna install ubuntu on D: . I don't wanna do a "install inside windows", what are my other options?
2009-09-28T15:27:00.000Z	lizzzy		I have the ubuntu cd with me.
2009-09-28T15:28:00.000Z	lizzzy		and there is an option to install into sdb?
