2009-10-27T22:20:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	nightshade	i had the same problem until Edit/Preferences and lowered the resolution - good luck
2009-10-27T22:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	nightshade	sorry no other ideas - good luck
2009-10-27T22:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	nightshade	did you try using 320x240?  that is the ONLY resolution that works on my EEE (it's an old 701 mind you)
