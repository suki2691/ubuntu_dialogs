2007-03-28T10:52:00.000Z	ph8		I'm having fairly big login issues with gnome, is there a way to 'reset' all my configuration files to default-ish user login?
2007-03-28T10:53:00.000Z	vanberge	ph8	you could probably delete /home/username/.gnome*
2007-03-28T10:53:00.000Z	vanberge	ph8	i would wait for at least one other person to ok that though.  :-)
