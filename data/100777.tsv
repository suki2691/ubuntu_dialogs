2008-02-21T09:00:00.000Z	mbrush		i ended up using UnionFS to unite the two bind mounted dirs
2008-02-21T09:01:00.000Z	thunderchicken_	mbrush	ive been reading about unionfs but i cant seem to get it to work if i try and unionfs two folders to another folder the folder i want them to bind gets deleted
2008-02-21T09:02:00.000Z	mbrush	thunderchicken_	bind mount two seperate dirs and then unionfs them together in a third dir
