2012-02-28T15:42:00.000Z	tm_		ok.. running beta of 12.04. apparmor logs profile-updates to kern.log (i.e. dmesg)
2012-02-28T15:44:00.000Z	tm_		iirc the problem is not 12.04-specific
2012-02-28T15:44:00.000Z	theadmin	tm_	Still, 12.04 is unsupported here. Fixes which work for Oneiric might fail on Precise and vice versa.
2012-02-28T15:45:00.000Z	tm_	theadmin	s/12.04/11.10/ a solution for oneiric would be ok for me at first
