2007-01-29T10:14:00.000Z	cablesm102	tavdash_	i doubt it
2007-01-29T10:15:00.000Z	tavdash_	cablesm102	& xtknight, when i right click on youtube flash video it states Flash Player 9, but I'm skeptical to believe its the latest
2007-01-29T10:16:00.000Z	cablesm102	tavdash_	flashplayer 9 is the latest. Try it, see what happens, if it's not Flash Player 9 yuou can just install FP9 manually. It's very simple.
