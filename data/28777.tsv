2010-07-22T00:20:00.000Z	Mubuntu		Is this the right place for me to come and chat with Ubuntu users who are helpful enough to chat a bit? I get people giving a one-liner and when I responded, they seem to just ignore.
2010-07-22T00:21:00.000Z	Mubuntu		I am asking about reinstalling grub2. Was that not relevant here?
2010-07-22T00:22:00.000Z	Mubuntu		Being first time on this chat, I would appreciate some help on how to use this chat and of course, I came here to get help for Ubuntu as a newbie.
