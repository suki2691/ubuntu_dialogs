2004-12-20T07:18:00.000Z	grumbel		other question, how do I configure sound under ubuntu? there isn't any central tool like yast, right? neither could I find alsaconf
2004-12-20T07:19:00.000Z	grumbel		ubuntu itself seems to have loaded the right modules, but I get /dev/dsp: no such device errors
2004-12-20T07:19:00.000Z	grumbel		and 'cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp1' doesn't provide a sound either
2004-12-20T07:19:00.000Z	Nivlem	grumbel	I just used the default volume control under the applications menu
