2008-08-17T06:47:00.000Z	Flannel	kerin	No, but it's totally unnecessary, especially in his case.
2008-08-17T06:48:00.000Z	Flannel	kerin	Nah, editing sudoers is dangerous (especially if you have no idea what you're doing).  So, apart from just being complicated for the sake of complication, its more risky than the easier methods.
