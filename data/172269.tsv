2006-08-03T11:43:00.000Z	Ch4r		Hey, I've got a quick question. When my friend tries to install Ubuntu, he gets a message saying it couldn't install the kernel (linux-386). He's installed Ubuntu from that CD before, so I don't think the CD is corrupted. Is there some way to select a different kernel to install? Or is there some other possible solution to the problem?
