2009-11-04T02:46:00.000Z	evilgeniuself		I just upgraded to Ubuntu 9.10, and I am experiencing a lot of bugs, such as programs closing while still keeping the image displayed, and firefox no longer works even in failsafe mode (where none of the other problems are occuring). Could someone please help me?
