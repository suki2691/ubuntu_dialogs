2005-12-15T13:25:00.000Z	linux_n00b_e		Ok guys, finally got my box to boot, but I'm getting some BIOS errors. Could someone help me understand what they mean?
2005-12-15T13:27:00.000Z	linux_n00b_e		No actually I haven't tried to Google the errors... I was hoping one of you knowledgeable people could help :)

2005-12-15T13:27:00.000Z	Amaranth	linux_n00b_e	unless we have the exact same board as you we probably can't help
