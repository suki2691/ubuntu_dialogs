2006-10-09T07:44:00.000Z	dragonriot		is there a way to upgrade to the 2.6.18 kernel without losing the Ubuntu boot screen?
2006-10-09T07:46:00.000Z	dragonriot		Nothing really... better question; Is there a way to get Synaptic Package manager to upgrade to 2.6.18 or do I have to do it manually (I don't mind doing it manually, but I'd rather Ubuntu KNOWS that I've upgraded the kernel...
2006-10-09T07:47:00.000Z	kitche	dragonriot	think there is a document on how to make kernel packages
2006-10-09T08:09:00.000Z	kitche	dragonriot	it's own repos
