2008-01-25T23:16:00.000Z	muszek		hi... I'm having problems with my wi-fi driver (ipw3945) and I don't think it'll be fixed for gutsy... so I'm thinking of compiling 2.6.24 myself... is it a good idea?
2008-01-25T23:17:00.000Z	DRebellion	muszek	you could package it for us ;)
2008-01-25T23:18:00.000Z	muszek	DRebellion	I've never compiled a kernel, nor packaged anything... would you really want to install it from me? :D
2008-01-25T23:19:00.000Z	DRebellion	muszek	i don't think you'd have to compile the whole kernel
