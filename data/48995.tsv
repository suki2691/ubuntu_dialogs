2009-11-07T08:42:00.000Z	frostburn	MadSeaDog	that depends on your dhcp server, not much you can do if it assigns the same ip based on mac
2009-11-07T08:44:00.000Z	MadSeaDog	frostburn	any configuration setting to request another ip?
2009-11-07T08:45:00.000Z	frostburn	MadSeaDog	no, it depends on the configuration of the dhcp server (your router/isp etc)
