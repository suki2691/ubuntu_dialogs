2012-05-18T16:10:00.000Z	[yates]		Hi, does anyone know why there is no image file and only headers located here, http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.4-rc7-precise/  ?
2012-05-18T16:12:00.000Z	[yates]		someone from canonical asked me to test the latest upstream kernel for an ongoing kernel bug, he said 3.4-rc7 however there is no image so im a bit confused now
2012-05-18T16:14:00.000Z	[yates]		will do, i though perhapes in the meantime there was someone here who knew quicker
2012-05-18T16:14:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	[yates]	 if the comes directly from canonical, it may be beyond this channel
