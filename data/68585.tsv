2009-09-02T15:23:00.000Z	xarvh		Hi!! Using eeebuntu jaunty. Any suggestion for a standalone program I can use to listen to jamendo radio? audacious gets stuck, vlc and s/g/mplayer seg faults and rythmbox/banshee are so complex than I don't even know where to start
2009-09-02T15:25:00.000Z	DJNomad	xarvh	listen does it i believe
2009-09-02T15:25:00.000Z	xarvh		k, trying =)
2009-09-02T15:45:00.000Z	xarvh	DJNomad	listen fails miserably! It does not even start if i give the URL or the m3u as cli parameter, and gets stuck otherwise! =(
