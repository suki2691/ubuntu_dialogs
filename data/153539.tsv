2006-12-30T06:14:00.000Z	Turgon		Thank you, HymnToLife and n2diy. nix_ferret: I didn't want an account with no password and permanent admin rights available. Would there be a problem if I try to change just the password from nothing to some word for the root user?
2006-12-30T06:16:00.000Z	nix_ferret	Turgon	I believe the pass is actually "root password"
2006-12-30T06:16:00.000Z	nix_ferret	Turgon	fyi, you can password yhe boot grub
2006-12-30T06:19:00.000Z	nix_ferret	Turgon	yes, that would be a better idea. Also, you can hide boot options until the right pass is entered
