2006-10-03T10:32:00.000Z	eracc	WillEyedOney	I just asked in ##freebsd if the AHA 1542 is still supported with the latest FreeBSD ... answer - yes. Maybe you need to move to FreeBSD for your AHA 1542 adapter.
2006-10-03T10:33:00.000Z	WillEyedOney	eracc	thanks for asking, I'll dump the card and stick it in the spares bin
