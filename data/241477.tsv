2010-10-17T08:16:00.000Z	nankura		Hello, i have a question about ubuntu, i need an expert so pm me if you can help
2010-10-17T08:18:00.000Z	nankura		ok basically, i just tried Linux Mint 9, and im dissapointed. ATi driver support is crappy. and its abit to simple, i heard its a remake of Ubuntu but ubuntu has more ATi card support for newer drivers and wine/games like mass effect 2/medal of honor etc
2010-10-17T08:19:00.000Z	nankura		ok i get the support is bad for linux. but has anyone managed to get a good smooth driver working. within the 10.x series
2010-10-17T08:20:00.000Z	nikola	nankura	i did just default install, enabled drivers and effects, and everything is working fine
