2012-05-05T22:28:00.000Z	simon__		Hi, I really need some help enlarging the pointer size on 12.04, I have followed this http://askubuntu.com/questions/126491/how-do-i-change-the-cursor-and-its-size and created a .Xresources but it wont work. It's an upgrade for a partially sighted person and this is a real show stopper... help?
