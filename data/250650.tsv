2005-02-11T14:34:00.000Z	daniels		good thanks
2005-02-11T14:37:00.000Z	syn-ack	daniels	I have a question for you if you dont mind. Is there a way that I can keep the pass in Gnomekeyring for a Samba session always active, instead of only for that session?
2005-02-11T14:38:00.000Z	daniels	syn-ack	probably not, but I don't use gnome-keyring
