2012-02-20T00:13:00.000Z	absolutionx		Would anyone be able to point me out to a good tutorial for compiling the 3.2.6 kernel on 11.10?
2012-02-20T00:14:00.000Z	bobo37773	absolutionx	Are you trying to do a custom kernel or just an updated one?
2012-02-20T00:16:00.000Z	absolutionx	bobo37773	I wanted to update to the latest kernel
2012-02-20T00:16:00.000Z	bobo37773	absolutionx	Yeah you just need a 3rd party ppa
