2006-01-01T17:25:00.000Z	kevinix		anyone here had experiences with dialup modems failing to find a carrier despite on windows the same modem finds it fine? i'm using the linuxant hsfmodem 'free' driver on an IBM r51e thinkpad

2006-01-01T17:27:00.000Z	holycow	kevinix	they can be configured to work but require a good bit of poking around for some modems.  others will work fine.  unfortunately mostly all you can do is google up your particular model.  i know a non answer
