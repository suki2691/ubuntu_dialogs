2007-12-15T11:45:00.000Z	wols	MiddleOfNowhere	you cannot. it's never a client option. you need a cloak instead
2007-12-15T11:47:00.000Z	wols	MiddleOfNowhere	you've been told already
2007-12-15T11:51:00.000Z	wols	MiddleOfNowhere	it doesn't matter. you cannot cloak your IP with a irc client. no possible way
