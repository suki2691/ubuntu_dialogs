2008-04-07T07:31:00.000Z	psmith	Pir8	. dotech : IMHO with in the next couple of years wie will se a full discontinuaion of research and developement dollars besing spent on the 32bit processors by Amd, Intel , Ctrix and others.
2008-04-07T07:32:00.000Z	dotech	psmith	yep, no need within the next 30 years for more than 64-bit
2008-04-07T07:33:00.000Z	dotech	psmith	at that point it will be a different architecture most likely, quantum, etc
