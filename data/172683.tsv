2006-08-09T13:01:00.000Z	cica		guys: anyone able to advise please? When I do apt-get update it drops out half way through with the following errors:E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
2006-08-09T13:01:00.000Z	cica		E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
