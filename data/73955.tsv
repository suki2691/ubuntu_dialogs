2011-01-26T09:33:00.000Z	EnigmaticCoder		I'm planning to write a quick text file that I will delete after using. Is this a good situation to save it to /dev/null? (I've never used /dev/null before)
2011-01-26T09:34:00.000Z	b4|hraban	EnigmaticCoder	no
2011-01-26T09:34:00.000Z	b4|hraban	EnigmaticCoder	save it to /tmp
2011-01-26T09:34:00.000Z	b4|hraban	EnigmaticCoder	/dev/null is a special file itself, not a directory
