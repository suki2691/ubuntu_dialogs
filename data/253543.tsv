2005-07-07T15:17:00.000Z	pablo928		I'm doing a dual boot install on a 80 GB Hdd. 20 GB for XP on a FAT32 partition and 80 GB for Ubuntu with 3xt3 partition. Is this going to work? (I'm installing XP right now).

2005-07-07T15:18:00.000Z	cavediver	pablo928	however, you can't have 20GB of XP and 80 GB of Ubuntu on a 80 GB hd..
2005-07-07T15:18:00.000Z	cavediver	pablo928	ok.
