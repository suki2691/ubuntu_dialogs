2005-07-31T09:57:00.000Z	cafuego	MrGardenHoseMan	After you've set it up, 'pon <providername>'
2005-08-06T09:03:00.000Z	cafuego	MrGardenHoseMan	Yes, it involves a rescue disk and undoing the damage windows did to the MBR.
2005-08-06T09:04:00.000Z	cafuego	MrGardenHoseMan	No, restoring the MBR is trivial.
