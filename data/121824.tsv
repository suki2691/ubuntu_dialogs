2009-01-21T14:14:00.000Z	sl00		Hi. How can I remove Places and System menu? Or even just remove entries from those menus? Right click does not work (which suck IMO). I have tried the menu editor but it only allow me to add/remove programs from the menu and not all entries.

2009-01-21T14:18:00.000Z	sl00	_2	Where do I find the gnome-menu? I have two menu options when I choose "add to panel" and it is the single button one with Programsd, places and system under it and the other one which shows the icon and the program, places and system text in the panel.
2009-01-21T14:19:00.000Z	_2	sl00	that maybe version specific, sorry.
