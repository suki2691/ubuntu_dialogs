2009-02-01T23:06:00.000Z	Wunderbar		ok, halfway to solving my minor problem
2009-02-01T23:07:00.000Z	Wunderbar		apparently the 'default' app doesn't work
2009-02-01T23:07:00.000Z	Wunderbar		so where would i need to go in order to select xchat as irc client??
2009-02-01T23:08:00.000Z	nyaa	Wunderbar	I would guess in firefox under edit > preferences > applications but mine currently doesnt have an x chat option =/
