2006-03-03T09:36:00.000Z	Iceman		Should look into a duel socket 754 mobo .. and get a board and second cpu ... run 2x cpu's and ubuntu 64 .... :)
2006-03-03T09:37:00.000Z	Iceman		Boy, hard decision, get a new Duel CPU socket 754 board and a Second CPU, or get a new Socket 939 64 bit cpu, and mobo ... ?
2006-03-03T09:38:00.000Z	KakiPukul	Iceman	do you want a SMP kernel or just single CPU kernel?
