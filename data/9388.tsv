2011-09-23T18:42:00.000Z	Druss		i have a ubuntu box with 2 hdd's and the main drive has a partition with ubuntu on it the partition is ext4, the rest of that main hdd is ntfs. now i have a second drive that is all ntfs. yes the windows boxes in other rooms can see the drive over the samba ntwk but cannot access the files of any of the share folders on any of the hdd that is in ntfs format. did i explain it good?
