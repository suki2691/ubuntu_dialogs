2008-04-02T21:04:00.000Z	german1410		Al203: In my case I have a radeon 9250 and it is not suported from feisty. I think this is not the case for nvidia
2008-04-02T21:06:00.000Z	german1410		Al203: did you try to reconfigure the driver package?
2008-04-02T21:06:00.000Z	Al2O3	german1410	not even sure how to do that, so the answer would be no, unless that is to enable the video driver that the system thought I needed.
