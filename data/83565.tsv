2009-05-02T08:29:00.000Z	Meinmartini		Out of curiosity, guys, if anyone can answer: For those who have been using ubuntu for awhile, how good is it on resources?
2009-05-02T08:29:00.000Z	Meinmartini		Is there any slowdown time, is it bad on RAM, boot times, load times?
2009-05-02T08:30:00.000Z	stryd_one	Meinmartini	it's very good
