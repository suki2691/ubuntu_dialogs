2011-02-20T01:48:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu		I have a computer with like 5 or 6 accounts on it, I want everyone to be able to access the pictures, but only me to be able to modify and delete them, what is the best way to go about that?

2011-02-20T01:51:00.000Z	KM0201	shane4ubuntu	why not put it somewhere other than /home ?
2011-02-20T01:52:00.000Z	KM0201	shane4ubuntu	no.. /home/pictures, is still /hjome
