2005-05-21T16:36:00.000Z	Thirsteh	trandom	is your network IP determined by DHCP?
2005-05-21T16:37:00.000Z	Thirsteh	trandom	ah okay, there are some ethernet adaptors that take a while to be set to an IP address for some reason... If you've experienced (if you've run Windows) that your network wouldn't start up after until 2 minutes after you started Windows, it's not a problem with Ubuntu, but with your router, NIC, or ISP.
