2008-06-15T06:32:00.000Z	thornomad	legend2440	hmm ... do you have the right deb line for that ? i'm just uncommenting what came with the install -- didn't realize something was missing ...

2008-06-15T06:34:00.000Z	thornomad	legend2440	thanks as well !  i have a server install so will have to do it manually
