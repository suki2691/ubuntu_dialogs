2012-06-14T14:13:00.000Z	SDX		I just installed Firefox 13 in /opt, but I can't find where I'm supposed to put any plugin files.  Plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins aren't recognized.
2012-06-14T14:14:00.000Z	SDX		Does anyone here know where they should go?
2012-06-14T14:16:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	SDX	you do know Firefox 13 is already in the repos right?
2012-06-14T14:17:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	SDX	ubuntu usually has the latest firefox version within a week, so unless you are a beta tester, there's not much point in installing it manually anymore
