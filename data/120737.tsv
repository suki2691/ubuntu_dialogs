2007-12-01T20:53:00.000Z	JEFFmasterFLEX	linxeh	 there is a firefox extension that lets you save an entire webpage as a PDF
2007-12-01T20:54:00.000Z	linxeh	JEFFmasterFLEX	that's not what I want. I'd like to make a mirror of the entire wiki for use on a network without internet access
2007-12-01T20:55:00.000Z	linxeh	JEFFmasterFLEX	a db copy would be less of a hit on bandwidth and CPU than doing a page by page crawl of the site
