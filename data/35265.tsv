2011-06-17T23:06:00.000Z	kender_		I just installed Gnome 3 in ubuntu using the ppa and I noticed that it is not searching through the files in my home when I type something in the search bar
2011-06-17T23:06:00.000Z	kender_		has anybody had a similar problem?
2011-06-17T23:06:00.000Z	Oer	kender_	gnome3 is not supported yet, unstable
