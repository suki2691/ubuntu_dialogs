2009-10-23T22:14:00.000Z	rascal911		I know someone who has a wubi install and everytime they try and boot into ubuntu it drops into busybox, this is because windows wasn't shutdown properly, the disk wasn't cleanly unmounted, which is what ubuntu says before dropping to bb, what's the mount command and subsequent commands to get ubuntu working again? Much appreciated
