2007-04-05T14:06:00.000Z	brainiac8008		i have an nvidia geforce 4 MX 64mb graphics card installed as part of my motherboard.  My 3-d graphics do not work well at all.  They are very choppy.  I can easily tell by the screensavers.  I know that my graphics card can work well with 3d graphics because I have Windows XP on a partition and the 3d graphics on Windows work.  Any ideas/suggestions?
