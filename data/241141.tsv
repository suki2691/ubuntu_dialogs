2006-01-01T15:09:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie		A 40 MB utility partition, and a 200GB ntfs partition (bootable).  The 200 GB ntfs partition is 1/4 full with windows junk...can I just resize it with the partitioner on the ubuntu cd
2006-01-01T15:11:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie		ok say i want 10 gig for ubuntu...how do I set it up without killing current windows...that is what scares me.
