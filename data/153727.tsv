2007-02-06T11:14:00.000Z	blankfaze		i am asking what to reformat my ntfs disk to
2007-02-06T11:14:00.000Z	vox754	blankfaze	yes is ext3. Though, the first time I installed SUSE 10.0 it used ReiserFS.
2007-02-06T11:31:00.000Z	vox754	blankfaze	use the Knoppix CD, or the Ubuntu Live CD, or GPrted CD, many "easy" options.
