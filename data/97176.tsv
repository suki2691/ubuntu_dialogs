2008-04-14T07:47:00.000Z	ani1	gregcha117	have you checked alsamixer to make sure its not muted?
2008-04-14T07:47:00.000Z	gregcha117	ani1	yep
2008-04-14T07:48:00.000Z	gregcha117	ani1	my sound has been missing for a while and it seems to be recognized properly by the sound settings and alsamixer but yet i get no sound, i booted from a livecd i downloaded and it works on this but not on my actual install
