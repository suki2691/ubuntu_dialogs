2005-03-23T16:39:00.000Z	Blaubaer		one quick question: will there be a way to upgrade to hoary from a existing warty-installation?
2005-03-23T16:40:00.000Z	kent	Blaubaer	yes. There is documents about that on the ubuntu wiki (check the ubuntu homepage)
2005-03-23T16:40:00.000Z	Blaubaer	kent	thanks, havent found anything about it yet.
2005-03-23T16:42:00.000Z	kent	Blaubaer	its just a matter of changing every warty  word in either synaptic or doing it manually by editing /etc/apt/sources.list.   http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/GuideToHoary
