2012-03-09T12:03:00.000Z	dearone		In my first hour of Ubuntu (or any Linux version) ever, just curious how I can access file directories?  Ex: I need to find xChat's data directory to add auto-loading scripts when I connect to IRC
2012-03-09T12:04:00.000Z	Ileden	dearone	Are you interested in accessing them from a graphical interface, or command line?

If you want to access all of yuor files with it, you can poke around with it's settings to turn "show hidden files", which on linux are any files that start with a dot, like ".hidden"
