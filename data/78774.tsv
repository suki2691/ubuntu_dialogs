2009-11-02T23:10:00.000Z	Revol5		I'm getting this error in Synaptic: "W: Ignoring Provides line with DepCompareOp for package libva"
2009-11-02T23:11:00.000Z	matreya6	Revol5	That's no error, it's a Warning (W for Warning)
2009-11-02T23:13:00.000Z	matreya6	Revol5	Just that it is Ignoring the "Provides" line somewhere in the source code, wherever that may be and wahtever that may mean...In short: Haven't got the foggiest idea.
2009-11-02T23:13:00.000Z	matreya6	Revol5	If nothing is actually malfunctioning, I wouldn't bother looking into it.
