2007-06-04T10:14:00.000Z	ii		Hi, sorry if I'm going about this question the wrong way (first time here) but my laptop has crashed out twice today while I had a lot of windows open - problem is that the second time it packed up (no response, even with Ctrl-Alt-Bksp) I was halfway through a dist-upgrade (not major, just I like to use aptitude instead of the update manager - not from 6.10 to 7.04 or anything!) and now I'm getting the following message: [Error: Opening the cache (E:Could not open
2007-06-04T10:14:00.000Z	ii		file /var/cache/apt/srcpkgcache.bin - open (13 Permission denied), E:The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.)]  --- On top of that, I had to edit my fstab to change all sda values to hda in order to mount my other partitions (saw the change in the /dev directory) --- sorry to bother you with the length of this question, folks ...
