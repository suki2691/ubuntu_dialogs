2010-08-06T21:47:00.000Z	ikonia	doctorZeus	by software raid, you mean mdadm, if you have a modern processor thats on a box thats not %90 utilised, it's perfect
2010-08-06T21:50:00.000Z	ikonia	doctorZeus	I have excellent performance on both raid 1, 5 and 6
2010-08-06T21:52:00.000Z	ikonia	doctorZeus	I was losing power recently funny enough, and I've had zero issue with array rebuild
