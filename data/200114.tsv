2009-12-02T11:10:00.000Z	nanotube	bmachine	you probably mean 'terminal command', since ssh doesn't have anything to do with gzip...
2009-12-02T11:11:00.000Z	nanotube	bmachine	and if that's the case, then you're looking for 'gunzip'
2009-12-02T11:12:00.000Z	nanotube	bmachine	yes. "man gunzip" for details. :)
