2009-11-01T01:50:00.000Z	trism	mathepic	gksudo -u gdm dbus-launch gnome-appearance-properties; this will let you set the gtk theme and wallpaper, etc
2009-11-01T01:51:00.000Z	mathepic	trism	that doesn't work
2009-11-01T01:52:00.000Z	trism	mathepic	it will say gnome appearance properties, but it will edit the gdm theme
