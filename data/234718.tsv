2005-09-03T14:15:00.000Z	YT		Could someone help me with a xorg CPU usage question?
2005-09-03T14:16:00.000Z	YT		I'm running Ubuntu, and Xorg is eating up 80-100% CPU time and 20% of memory. Only seems to happen after after about 6-8 hours of uptime.
2005-09-03T14:17:00.000Z	YT		if I restart X, then it's fine for another 6-8 hours. then it's back to 80-100% CPU usage.
2005-09-03T14:18:00.000Z	pfp	YT	a bug perhaps..
