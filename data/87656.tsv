2008-06-15T07:07:00.000Z	gluonman		I'm having a problem with Firefox. I can't play an online game because it's missing plugins. Another site is telling me that I need to install Java. But after fooling around for an hour trying to install Java or download plugins where instructed, it has all been for nothing. What must I do>

2008-06-15T07:10:00.000Z	PapaJDub	gluonman	does it tell you what plugin you need?
2008-06-15T07:11:00.000Z	gluonman	PapaJDub	one sight led me to a link to install Java. But it just installed a .bin file that does nothing. Other sites say "missing plugins" but have nothing listed.
