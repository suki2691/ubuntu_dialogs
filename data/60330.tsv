2009-04-16T10:17:00.000Z	celthunder	aaditya	you can compile 32 bit programs in a 64 bit host without a chroot cant you? since most are x86 64 they include the 32 bit libraries anyway
2009-04-16T10:18:00.000Z	aaditya	celthunder	should be able to; haven't ever heard about using chroot for that purpose
2009-04-16T10:19:00.000Z	celthunder	aaditya	well you typed !chroot at someone and it said "such as compiling 32 bit apps in a 64 bit os" which made me wonder if im wrong in assuming....
