2010-02-14T01:56:00.000Z	corey	HammerHead66	you could use the synaptic interface
2010-02-14T01:59:00.000Z	corey	HammerHead66	check about:plugins in firefox to see if it's recognizing it
2010-02-14T02:00:00.000Z	corey	HammerHead66	you can also run 'firefox' from a terminal and see the output, should contain debug information for the symbols loaded
