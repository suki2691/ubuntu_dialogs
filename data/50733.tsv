2009-08-26T22:30:00.000Z	deany	jMyles	metacity --replace
2009-08-26T22:31:00.000Z	jMyles	deany	Yeah, but if they can't even get to the desktop?  So they drop to a terminal, run export DISPLAY=:0 and then metacity --replace.  Fine, but how to boot with metacity from now on?
2009-08-26T22:33:00.000Z	deany	jMyles	can they boot to the desktop after metacity --replace?
