2007-06-12T08:32:00.000Z	carlhempel	Frogzoo	a lot of people are having this problem ... For instance, the system clock in the guest os is about 5 times slower than the real thing
2007-06-12T08:32:00.000Z	carlhempel	Frogzoo	there is a fix to make it "fast" by changing the "max_cstate" but that is unacceptable because it makes the system clock 10 times faster ...
