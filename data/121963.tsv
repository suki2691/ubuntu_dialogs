2008-06-30T02:39:00.000Z	pac1		looked all over for how to do that.  Plenty of advice on installing linux on usb cards but none on how to connect them in the first place.

2008-06-30T02:45:00.000Z	pac1	Jordan_U	I had this old sandisk reader that didn't used to work on linux.  Just for fun I plugged it in and stuff came right up.  What a difference a couple of years makes.
