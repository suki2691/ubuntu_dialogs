2009-02-13T06:11:00.000Z	madmike		Just switched to ubuntu from gentoo.  anyone tell me how to change the mount points for a hard drive?  I changed it to a folder in /mnt using the (right click>properties) and now it says it can't have "/" in the mount point, and it won't mount automatically
2009-02-13T06:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	madmike	 you mean the entries in /etc/fstab ?  or are you still in the installer? that right click stuff.. is proberly not what you want to play with.
2009-02-13T06:15:00.000Z	madmike	Dr_Willis	 I checked fstab and there's no entries for any of my drives in there yet, just proc and boot and such
2009-02-13T06:16:00.000Z	madmike	Dr_Willis	 Alright I'll just do that then.  Thanks man
