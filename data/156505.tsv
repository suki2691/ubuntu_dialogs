2007-09-20T07:44:00.000Z	Jeruvy		how come when I right click on a folder and select properties and then permission then change the permissions, 'nothing happens'???
2007-09-20T07:45:00.000Z	Jeruvy		then why doesn't it 'say' I have permissions?

2007-09-20T07:46:00.000Z	genii	Jeruvy	Jack_Sparrow explained, use gksudo nautilus   to run it with admin privelege
