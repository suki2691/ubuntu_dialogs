2007-08-21T13:58:00.000Z	aaronc	ompaul	yes, the install is easy (so is every other distro)  figuring out where everything is and why its all spread out is what's disturbing
2007-08-21T13:59:00.000Z	aaronc	ompaul	I'm used to having all data under /var/www    and /etc/httpd holding the config.  And the config structure makes sense
