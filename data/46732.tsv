I tried editing fstab with option users, and I tried chmod, and I tried changing the permissions in nautilus, no luck

2009-09-29T12:19:00.000Z	ndlovu	colinmarc	can you write to the mounted volume if you don't go through samba (ie as a regular user on the machine)?
2009-09-29T12:19:00.000Z	colinmarc	ndlovu	no, not without root access
