2008-01-18T20:07:00.000Z	tzd		does anyone know if it's possible for uTorrent to write to ext3 hdds? I'm using it via wine?

2008-01-18T20:08:00.000Z	tzd	spite	great thanks!
2008-01-18T20:10:00.000Z	tzd	spite	so if i have rss enabled downloads in uTorrent that saves to dir X on my old NTFS drive... Is it just to specify (inside uTorrent) a new folder on an ext3 partition?
