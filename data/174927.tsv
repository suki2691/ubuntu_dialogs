2006-07-14T13:25:00.000Z	LarsJ		Hello everybody. I have dumped windows for Ubuntu, I'm just learning, setup apache2, works great. Is there any way to change things so i can edit files in "/var/www" without having to do "sudo" all the time? BTW: im using this for site development, not actual live site hosting. Ubuntu rocks!
