2010-11-07T08:27:00.000Z	Ahsaloma	airtonix	: i read about the dependancies and it said the SDL development libraries were needed so i installed them through synaptic, now i am getting this error while trying to compile
2010-11-07T08:29:00.000Z	airtonix	Ahsaloma	im no expert with compiling, but i would suggest reading the "readme" that came with the package you downloaded, or reading the website...or sending the developer an email.
