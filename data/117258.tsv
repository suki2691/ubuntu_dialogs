2007-10-18T20:24:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	ae88925	yes.  if you were using the RC repos, then you apt-get update and viola you are on the release.
2007-10-18T20:25:00.000Z	ae88925	nerdygirl_ellie	perfect, thanks
2007-10-18T20:33:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	ae88925	that depends on the mountpoint and device
