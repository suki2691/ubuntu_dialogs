2006-03-19T14:18:00.000Z	Lil-Abner		Hi. I just finished installig ubuntu and made a major goof. I apparently stopped the downloading of current updates and can't restart them without going into superuser.
2006-03-19T14:19:00.000Z	Lil-Abner		That's the problem, rukuartic. I don't have a pw for superuser, I don't think.
2006-03-19T14:20:00.000Z	Lil-Abner		I was asked to put in a user name and pw for myself but not for root.
