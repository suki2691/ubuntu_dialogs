2007-02-18T14:03:00.000Z	toddobryan		I'm trying to help someone finish an Ubuntu installation. His only net connection is a USB wireless stick. There's a Howto to get it working, but it requires downloading packages to compile something.
2007-02-18T14:03:00.000Z	toddobryan		Is there a way to grab a package (and its dependencies) from the repos and easily save them to a flash drive or CD?
2007-02-18T14:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	toddobryan	 thats a feature of the apt-get system. ive seen covered in the apt-get manuals/guides/docs/tutorials
