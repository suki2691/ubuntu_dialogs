2011-02-07T01:47:00.000Z	guntbert	earthmeLon	whats wrong with it?
2011-02-07T01:50:00.000Z	earthmeLon	guntbert	 It doesn't like to actually copy stuff.  I'm quite confused about it sometimes removing my 'copied' stuff with something when I highlight text AND the "LEFT+RIGHT" mouse-click paste isn't working after about 10 minutes, but that's probably an xorg issue.
