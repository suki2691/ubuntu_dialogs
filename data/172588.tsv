2006-10-27T12:22:00.000Z	ChrisNiemy	aardfox	oops, ist nautilus-file-management-properties
2006-10-27T12:31:00.000Z	ChrisNiemy	aardfox	maybe you have type in a terminal "chmod a+x filename"  or make a desktop-starter by right clicking on the deskop -> create starter (or so), select the file and check at "run in terminal"
