2007-02-19T17:22:00.000Z	shatrat	__doc__	you cant legislate intelligence into consumers.  drivers are getting better and better.  nvidia ones are just as good as their windows product, and ati is at least trying to catch up
2007-02-19T17:23:00.000Z	__doc__	shatrat	you can legislate that a producer of hardware has to either provide working quality drivers for minor emerging operating systems around or open the spec so they can be provided. But doing neither and getting away with it, and thus helping m$ to promote their shoddyware isn't really in the interest of competition.
2007-02-19T17:25:00.000Z	shatrat	__doc__	so then everybody has to make drivers for gnu/hurd and opensolaris and minix or else open up their source so that patent trolls can take them to court over frivolous nonsense all over the world?   The problem is solving itself through market forces.  Intel voluntarily documents its hardware and nvidia supports linux bsd and solaris.   more annoying laws will only make things worse
2007-02-19T17:37:00.000Z	shatrat	__doc__	so maybe the swiss semiconductor giants should make their own wireless cards?
