2007-05-13T16:07:00.000Z	aarcane		Hi, I want to install Ubuntu on a Dell machine, replacing windows XP, but I do NOT want it to touch the partition table at all.  I just want it to use the existing windows XP partition as is so I can restore it back to the defaults when I'm done.  is this possible ?  I'm okay with always having to boot from CD or something similar.

2007-05-13T16:08:00.000Z	Flannel	aarcane	so, you don't want to touch the MBR? Or the partition table?
