2010-08-27T06:16:00.000Z	Divecks		hey, I've got a laptop running Ubuntu with some really bad speakers, but I have a desktop with Ubuntu that has really nice speakers. Is there any way I could "send" all my laptops audio through my desktop? Thanks!
2010-08-27T06:18:00.000Z	wombatguy	Divecks	why do you say that? I've heard it's the most featured but what exactly am I missing with cairodock?
2010-08-27T06:19:00.000Z	wombatguy		cairodock is good
2010-08-27T06:19:00.000Z	Divecks	wombatguy	I, personally, find docky the most beautiful and I really like the way it integrates with Gnome, and the weather/sound/batrery applets. Personal preference, though. I also think that Cairodock has a bit *too* much eyecandy for me :D
