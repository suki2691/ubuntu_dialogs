2008-12-29T03:07:00.000Z	nathanhelp		How do I boost the audio output (before it gets to the rear jack) by about 2-10db? when playing dvds or music it's far too quiet and i have my volumes all the way up.
2008-12-29T03:07:00.000Z	nathanhelp		there seems to be a significant difference between windows and linux audio, on the same hardware. I know my hardware is all fine and is capable of outputting more volume, but I dont know what to change (or where to look) for setting said volumes.
