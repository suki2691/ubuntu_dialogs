2011-06-12T07:54:00.000Z	FireStorms		Hey can someone help me with something
2011-06-12T07:56:00.000Z	FireStorms		I've got two mysql servers on my system, one came with xampp the other is from a lampp instillation. Now the lampp mysql server always starts first so xampp mysql server complains that one's already running on port 3306. How can I reverse this?
2011-06-12T07:57:00.000Z	FireStorms		Let me rephrase :P, in *Ubuntu* how do I stop the autostarting of services?
2011-06-12T07:59:00.000Z	qin	FireStorms	Upstart or init?
