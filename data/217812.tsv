2005-12-30T10:56:00.000Z	psusi	glyph	because some drives break when you turn it on
2005-12-30T10:57:00.000Z	glyph	psusi	Ah.  Is there a configuration file, or better yet, GUI, where I can turn it on?  Burning CDs like this is torture, and I don't want to have to enter the same command line on every boot (or start monkeying with init.d)
2005-12-30T10:58:00.000Z	psusi	glyph	hrm... shouldn't be too hard to add the command to init.d... search the forums, I'm sure there's a simple to follow howto on this
