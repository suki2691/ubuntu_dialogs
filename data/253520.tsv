2009-04-12T00:41:00.000Z	Roasted		This is sort of a windows question but also tied in with linux... I just set up a samba ubuntu computer for file sharing and my XP laptop cannot ping it, but it can ping my other samba ubuntu desktop I have here... I know wnidows takes a while for DNS to register what computer names are on the network. Would this be true in my case that maybe windows hasn't detected my other samba ubuntu desktop yet?

2009-04-12T02:19:00.000Z	user_	Roasted	sorry
