2007-04-22T14:00:00.000Z	NemesisD		ok guys so these guides are saying boot from xp cd, run recovery console and do fdisk /mbr, but doesn't this make grub go away?
2007-04-22T14:00:00.000Z	SpaceBassLaptop	NemesisD	then grub is not in the MBR...perhaps in its own partition
2007-04-22T14:01:00.000Z	NemesisD	SpaceBassLaptop	so will fdisk /mbr fix my "a disk read error occurred" error when booting windows but it won't touch GRUB?
2007-04-22T14:07:00.000Z	NemesisD	SpaceBassLaptop	uhh it did in fact get rid of grub...
