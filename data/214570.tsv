2005-10-10T05:47:00.000Z	Drakeson		a silly problem! : I have created an extra user (through kuser), added it to adm, admin, sudo, and now when I open a terminal with that account sudo doesn't ask the password!!!
2005-10-10T05:48:00.000Z	Drakeson		is sudo stable?
2005-10-10T05:48:00.000Z	Drakeson		sounds like it may cause severe security problems (at least in its current state)
