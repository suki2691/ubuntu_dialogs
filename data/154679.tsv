2009-07-25T12:19:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		I installed the fglrx drivers for my ATI Radeon 9600 video card, and it worked once, but now every time I try to set it with gksu displayconfig-gtk , it restarts, and tells me it can't detect my video card and monitor. every time I tell it to pick Radeon and Samsung, it forgets.
2009-07-25T12:20:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		It keeps defaulting to ati - somethingsomething[none of which are my video card]... [more stuff that I can't read and can't scroll to read]
2009-07-25T12:22:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		what's gksu ?
2009-07-25T12:23:00.000Z	n2diy	Chaotic_Descent	don't know, but gksudo is the command to run GUI apps as root.
