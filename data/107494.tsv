Ordinarily I'd assume /usr/local, but it looks like apt has already added some (python related) stuff there.  Do ubuntu users prefer /opt?  Somewhere else?
2008-08-21T01:31:00.000Z	tuxice	mr-onionhead	it is a python program?
2008-08-21T01:32:00.000Z	tuxice	mr-onionhead	normally source can be compiled and run from the ~ directory
2008-08-21T01:32:00.000Z	mr-onionhead	tuxice	It's not a python program.  It's a new build of Coq (coq.infria.fr).
