2012-11-08T02:22:00.000Z	delac		my hdd got a hit, ubuntu unable to boot, disks utility on live-usb tells there are bad sectors and viewing /home fails with  input/output error. any way to save data from /home?
2012-11-08T02:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	delac	may be time to resort to ddrescue. :-(
2012-11-08T02:37:00.000Z	delac	dr_willis	thanks for the suggestion. unfortunately ddrescue seems to only do whole disks (too big disk and I only need some of the files). Also it seems to create img that would still need fixining before one can mount and browse it.
2012-11-08T02:37:00.000Z	delac	dr_willis	can you recommend some direct fix?
