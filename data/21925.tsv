2010-12-22T22:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	safinaskar	i ran into problems with vmware 7.1 on ubuntu 10.10 - found some sketchy patch on the internet (don't have link) that fixed it - http://paste.ubuntu.com/546654/
2010-12-22T22:42:00.000Z	safinaskar	ZykoticK9	thanks, but this patch need vmware installed and I cannot install vmware
2010-12-22T22:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	safinaskar	that patch allowed me to install vmware...
2010-12-22T22:44:00.000Z	safinaskar	ZykoticK9	this patch applies to /usr/lib/vmware/modules/source/${mod}.tar, but vmware is not installed, so I have not /usr/lib/vmware/modules/source/${mod}.tar in my system, so I cannot apply patch
