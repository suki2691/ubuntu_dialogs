2005-02-03T16:33:00.000Z	eli		Can anybody make some suggestion on why grub will not boot, after installing for the first time?
2005-02-03T16:34:00.000Z	eli		Hi Demitar, thanks. Installed from the cd (on top of previous kanotix). First it says graphics file missing, then, grub menu still has kanotix...
