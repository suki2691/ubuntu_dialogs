2009-09-06T04:27:00.000Z	Boombox		Hello everyone. My Patchage is not connecting to my Jack-Server. Anyone know why this is?
2009-09-06T04:29:00.000Z	Boombox		No one's got an idea?
2009-09-06T04:29:00.000Z	lstarnes	Boombox	maybe you aren't running the jack server
2009-09-06T04:30:00.000Z	Boombox	lstarnes	I am. I can connect single applications through the jack control, but patchage just won't connect to jack
