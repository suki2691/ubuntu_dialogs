2008-10-24T22:42:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de		anyone here know anything about development of totem plugins in python or a good room to ask question about it in would be? I'm working on the youtube plugin for totem, I need to make it call a function just before adding something to a playlist when you right click and add to playlist, how can I do this?
