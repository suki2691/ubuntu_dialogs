2011-10-24T17:23:00.000Z	GreekFreak		Hi. In Ubuntu 11.04 the Radeon 6470m (NI Seymour) was unsupported. How can I find out if it is now supported in Ubuntu 11.10?
2011-10-24T17:25:00.000Z	norbert79	GreekFreak	Well, it's basically the driver supporting it, not the distribution itself. I would suggest finding out what version of the driver is being installed with "Hardware Drivers managerS2
2011-10-24T17:26:00.000Z	GreekFreak		aurondance: it was the default from "Additional Drivers". I'm assuming the latest on (11.9?)
