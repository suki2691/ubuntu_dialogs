2007-12-20T21:00:00.000Z	KNRO		hello, anyone knows if Build-Depends in a .dsc file means the dependencies of this package, or what packages are required in order for it to be built?
2007-12-20T21:01:00.000Z	wols	KNRO	build-deps are the packages (usually -dev packages) needed to build the binary .deb from the source
2007-12-20T21:04:00.000Z	wols	KNRO	do you run ubuntu or debian?
2007-12-20T21:13:00.000Z	KNRO	wols	building for Ubuntu, it's Depends, just found out
