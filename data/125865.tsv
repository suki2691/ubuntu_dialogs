2009-06-29T05:29:00.000Z	RequinB4		hey i'm getting a new box tomorrow and wondering if there is any reason i shouldn't install the 64bit version
2009-06-29T05:29:00.000Z	raylu	RequinB4	a few programs might have compatibility issues. how much RAM do you have and what do you intend to use your machine for?
2009-06-29T05:30:00.000Z	RequinB4	raylu	- 4GB, nothing particularly special just general use
2009-06-29T05:30:00.000Z	raylu	RequinB4	i'd go with 64-bit, then
