2010-07-13T12:59:00.000Z	pizzle	erUSUL	no it's actually showing the correct size in this output. However when I try to access the drive I cannot. I cannot mount the drive in disk utility as well. The label is supposed to be bizzle but shows up as bajizzle which is the 1.5 TB drive
2010-07-13T12:59:00.000Z	pizzle		I'm not able to access the drive to view the contents.. I'm sure it's something simple that I just don't know how to do
2010-07-13T13:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pizzle	First, have you rebooted since you swapped drives?
