2012-03-24T19:26:00.000Z	scott_z		I have created a link on my desktop to run a program. when i click on it, it askes me if i want to run it. It will run but how do I bypass that dialog box and have the program run just by clicking?
2012-03-24T19:27:00.000Z	drounse	scott_z	is it asking to run as root?
2012-03-24T19:29:00.000Z	scott_z	drounse	no, it says 'programname' is an executable text file. and my options are 'run in terminal' , 'display','cancel', and 'run'. I click on run and it is fine but i want to not have to click on anything, I want it to just run.
