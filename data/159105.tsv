2006-11-16T06:25:00.000Z	SethP		I managed to screw myself over pretty good... I acidentally unplugged my computer, and now it hangs whenever I get to "GRUB loading." Also, I can't get the liveCD to boot. Any chance someone can help me?
2006-11-16T06:26:00.000Z	haxality	SethP	was it booting from the CD before?
2006-11-16T06:26:00.000Z	SethP	haxality	no, I had a full edgy install that I was running when it crashed
2006-11-16T06:27:00.000Z	haxality	SethP	I'm going to PM you so it doesn't get lost in the sea of text
