2006-01-28T11:17:00.000Z	Tired_		Hello.  A friend of mine asked me to install Linux for dual-booting, just to see what the fuss is about.  I have a 2.5 GB partition available.  Will Ubuntu work well in that little space?
2006-01-28T11:17:00.000Z	holy_cow	Tired_	why bother ... download the trial for vmware for them and install it on that
2006-01-28T11:17:00.000Z	holy_cow	Tired_	if they are looking at 'what the fuss is about' you can just wipe vmware off their system after 30 days
2006-01-28T11:18:00.000Z	holy_cow	Tired_	your going to hose his system getting it to dual boot, its the wrong approach 'to see what the fuss is about'
