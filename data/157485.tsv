2007-04-03T14:43:00.000Z	bam79		OK... here goes... I installed Ubuntu on my lappy yesterday. I thought I partitioned the HD to keep Vista, but now Vista won't show up on the boot menu when I F12 during start-up... AND Ubuntu won't recognize my wireless card.
2007-04-03T14:44:00.000Z	bam79		I let Ubuntu run it's thing as default... which I thought it didn't overwrite Vista unles syou specifically told it to.
