2009-12-02T00:34:00.000Z	MrKeuner		how can i change the super key system wide?
2009-12-02T00:36:00.000Z	MrKeuner		It is so embarrassing to assign something to that key in GNU/Linux. Nothing should be assigned to something with MS logo on it. Could only be used for switching OS on double boot systems, or accessing ms website or something :)
2009-12-02T00:37:00.000Z	Mainstay	MrKeuner	just put some electrical tape over the logo on the key.
2009-12-02T00:37:00.000Z	MrKeuner	Mainstay	problem is that I do not have that key
