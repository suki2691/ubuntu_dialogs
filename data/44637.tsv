2009-10-28T00:53:00.000Z	everthonVS		Hi, I've installed Ubuntu 9.04 on my friends computer (core-quad, 4GB RAM) and Totem in fullscreen is kinda lagging. Any thoughts?
2009-10-28T00:53:00.000Z	ikonia	everthonVS	probably not using the write codec to watch the file
2009-10-28T00:59:00.000Z	everthonVS	ikonia	but it's XviD, and totem installed it automagically
2009-10-28T00:59:00.000Z	ikonia	everthonVS	just a suggestion
