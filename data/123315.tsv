2007-10-22T09:59:00.000Z	feross		hey guys, just DL 64-bit ubuntu. Before I blow my system away and install it. Should I stick to the regular i386 version or go to 64?
2007-10-22T09:59:00.000Z	Evanlec	feross	go for 64bit
2007-10-22T10:01:00.000Z	feross	Evanlec	There were some gotchas with 64 last time. Like flash wouldn't work and other stuff like that. Any of that now or are there simple workarounds for most issues?
2007-10-22T10:02:00.000Z	Evanlec	feross	flash is no longer an issue, otherwise i havent had any problems
