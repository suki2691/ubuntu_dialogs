2005-10-11T09:58:00.000Z	LazyAngel		is the boot partition only accessed when you boot? I want to put it on an old disk, but the disk  is noisy. So i want to unmount it when the boot is done...

2005-10-11T10:00:00.000Z	LazyAngel	vegiVamp	thanks. that was what i thought. just needed to double check before all the work :)
2005-10-11T10:00:00.000Z	vegiVamp	LazyAngel	just unmount it manually for a few days, and see what happens :-)
