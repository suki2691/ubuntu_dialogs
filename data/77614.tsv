2008-10-14T07:35:00.000Z	reqqit		Hey people - I am using ATI accelerated graphics driver - new machine, compiz runs fine. However, sticking to metacity to run blender, redraws are painfully slow
2008-10-14T07:35:00.000Z	reqqit		and blender runs like a dog - is there some other driver I can use?
2008-10-14T07:35:00.000Z	jdevel	reqqit	google has a lot of information indexed.. try a search.
2008-10-14T07:37:00.000Z	reqqit	jdevel	please elaborate - how much information are they indexing? I don't want to search there if I feel it may be in vain. Are they indexing over 9000? Actually, adding blender specifically to my query did find something I didn't find earlier
