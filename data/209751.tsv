2006-10-26T13:34:00.000Z	cryptonic		i thought it was down to my stupidity, looks like its nvidias to blame :D
2006-10-26T13:36:00.000Z	cryptonic		does the prerelease of edgy ubuntu not update itself to the finished edgy product or do i need to download another dvd image?
2006-10-26T13:36:00.000Z	LjL	cryptonic	it updates.
