2011-02-09T10:50:00.000Z	jeffwheeler		I found some site that mentioned user id >1000, but this doesn't seem to be the case. It's ID is <1000.

2011-02-09T10:51:00.000Z	jeffwheeler	usr13	It seems pretty safe to say a user was created with that name, presumably by a couchdb-related package. But it shouldn't be showing up in gdm. Not sure what is misconfigured that is causing it to be.
