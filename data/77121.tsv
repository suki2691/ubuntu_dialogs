2008-10-16T20:57:00.000Z	F2Knight		Does anyone know of a nice webgui to allow a user to access there backup files? say there was an rsync copy of there files, on a server, and they wanted to restore said file... anyone know of a web ui that would allow them to do that with out bothering the administrator????

2008-10-16T21:03:00.000Z	F2Knight	lievenmoors	Grsync looks like a wonderfull app for an administrator on an linux box. but I am thinking more of the windows/mac users in the office that just need to say login to there "account" and see all the files they have backed up over the last week with an option to restore that file.
