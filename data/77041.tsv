2009-03-07T09:36:00.000Z	Lighttitan		oh wait.... I think I know what repositories I am missing, something about midubuntu or something? Can someone please jog my memory?
2009-03-07T09:38:00.000Z	Lighttitan		In Synaptic I am missing some of my favorite apps when I go to search, like "Limewire" and "Boxee" does anyone know what repository I might be missing that would have such apps?
2009-03-07T09:38:00.000Z	ziroday	Lighttitan	you need to enable repo's for those projects
2009-03-07T09:39:00.000Z	Lighttitan	ziroday	I don't recall enabling repositories for those specifically, I think they were included in some kind of general repository I added at some point in my last Linux install
