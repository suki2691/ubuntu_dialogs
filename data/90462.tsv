2008-10-22T22:21:00.000Z	IrishDavid		hello, I have installed eclipse (downloaded package and extracted to /usr/local/eclipse) but I want to add eclipse to my path so that I can type eclipse in a terminal and it launch. I tried using ln but that didnt work as it cant find library
2008-10-22T22:21:00.000Z	IrishDavid		what do I need to do?
2008-10-22T22:21:00.000Z	IrishDavid		btw, I need version 3.4 so I'm not using apt-get install
