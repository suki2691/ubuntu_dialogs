2005-12-16T12:18:00.000Z	kid		I've a problem - I'm on complete CLI, -- on a very low memory laptop. I had all sorts of things on it before.. openoffice, things not really needed -- anyone know how I could have it list the major things with apt-get? Would like to remove some now
2005-12-16T12:20:00.000Z	_jason	kid	you can list all the packages with dpkg -l and if you want you can add a pattern so dpkg -l *mplayer* for example
2005-12-16T12:20:00.000Z	kid		Well I do have Fluxbox, but the things are on the menu are not executed on click
2005-12-16T12:20:00.000Z	kid	_jason	yep, thanks
