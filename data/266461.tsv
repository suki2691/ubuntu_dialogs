2010-05-20T06:46:00.000Z	LUCIDementia		I'm trying to do a frugal install (boot ubuntu without a disc) but having some troubles. Anyone here familiar with this process?

2010-05-20T06:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LUCIDementia	  that makes a specialized 'live cd' type install to the hard drive. it will not be the same as a normal install. You wont be able to save changes.
