2009-08-06T01:31:00.000Z	jrib	ndroftheline	what kind of trouble....?
2009-08-06T01:32:00.000Z	ndroftheline	jrib	i plugged it into an external caddy and it's not mounting. gparted recognizes it has an hfs partition but says there are 4 smaller partitions in front of it that are unrecognzied.
2009-08-06T01:32:00.000Z	ndroftheline	jrib	i'm moderately familiar with the mount command and have tried a number of iterations.
