2008-01-26T00:45:00.000Z	Task		If i wanted to have Ubuntu... and XP... Can I take my hard drive and partition it to 3 drives... and then use one for each OS and 1 to put files that I want to share between systems?
2008-01-26T00:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Task	yes, I do that here
2008-01-26T00:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Task	I suggest even more partitions...  you need swap of course, ou should also make /home which puts you over the 4 partition limit.
