2006-12-30T12:47:00.000Z	Feral_Kid		Could someone give me helping hand... I did a dpkg --get-selections > selections.lst. I thought that by doing a dpkg --set-selections < selections.lst, it would autmatically start downloading all the packages... Did I misunderstand the process?

2006-12-30T12:49:00.000Z	plypkie	Feral_Kid	you need apt-get to do the downloading
2006-12-30T12:57:00.000Z	plypkie	Feral_Kid	i was just trying to google it
