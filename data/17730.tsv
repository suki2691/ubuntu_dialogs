2011-02-24T20:10:00.000Z	JTS000ID		I was wondering if it's possible to deal with dual screens in a Shell script. Like saying push this program to Screen 2 or 3 and leave this program on Screen 1.
2011-02-24T20:10:00.000Z	JTS000ID		Any guidance, pointing to resources would be really appreciated.

2011-02-24T20:11:00.000Z	JTS000ID	Dr_Willis	I assume it can be done entirely in a script.
