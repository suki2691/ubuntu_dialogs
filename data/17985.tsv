2011-04-15T06:10:00.000Z	AegisX		Hi guys; I'm looking to make my Ubuntu laptop and Windows 7 desktop work together. This would include synching certain folders, ability to control my Windows box from Linux (is this SSH? I'm not too familiar with networking) and so on. Does anyone have any pointers?
