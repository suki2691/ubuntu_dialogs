2007-02-17T13:33:00.000Z	Quenyar		hello, anyone know why my USB Thumbnail drive isn't recognized?  How do I change its mind?
2007-02-17T13:35:00.000Z	Quenyar		have found some confusing USB mount "answers" but none of them made any sense
2007-02-17T13:36:00.000Z	Quenyar		when I insert the USB thumbnail drive in the USB port, it lights up, but I'm not getting any prompts, etc
