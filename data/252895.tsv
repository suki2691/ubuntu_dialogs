2007-10-10T09:45:00.000Z	kotau	EruditeHermit	it works pretty well for me.  I resized an NTFS part no prob
2007-10-10T09:48:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	kotau	did you defragment before doing it?
2007-10-10T09:48:00.000Z	kotau	EruditeHermit	I did it with a fresh install (I had no partition info because it was an OEM rescue disk)
