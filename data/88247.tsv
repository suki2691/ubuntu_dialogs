2008-08-16T12:22:00.000Z	yakobmatrix		anyone can tell me how I can compile C# source code in ubuntu?
2008-08-16T12:22:00.000Z	zcat[1]_	yakobmatrix	I suspect 'mono' would be a start
2008-08-16T12:23:00.000Z	yakobmatrix	zcat[1]_	I already tried mono, but I encounter this error when I try to compile it.
2008-08-16T12:25:00.000Z	zcat[1]_	yakobmatrix	you probably need that package
