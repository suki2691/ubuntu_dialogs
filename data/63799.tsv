2009-03-24T09:39:00.000Z	kematzy	A-KO	 no XP came with it. Bought with Linpus Linux, but crap, so
2009-03-24T09:41:00.000Z	kematzy	A-KO	 u serious?  There are other professions in the world where they just want a computer that's safe, runs 100% of the time and does what the basic requirements that they have. There are people out there that are good at other things than computers. OK ?
2009-03-24T09:45:00.000Z	A-KO	kematzy	The thing is, this computer isn't working. So you're a bit behind on your points.
