2006-04-22T13:25:00.000Z	scotth		does anyone have any recommendations for a good log analyzer.  I'm looking to do several things.  I want to do security related alerts, usage of the server(apache, postfix, cupsys, authlogs, etc.) and any thing else that will create a pretty picture for the PHB.  Any recommendations?  Ive tried lire but I can't get it to work right and configuration has been a night mare
