2005-03-29T14:20:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	geneo93	LOL... well, no... I was hoping to avoid that.
2005-03-29T14:20:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	geneo93	anyway, MEPIS is downloading very quickly, so I'll probably just try that if I have to reboot. I'm trying to recover my Pastor's laptop HD data before he sends it back to Dell for repair.
