2010-11-10T22:03:00.000Z	IdleOne		Could someone walk me through adding Windows 7 to Grub2?
2010-11-10T22:05:00.000Z	tiberious_	IdleOne	something about chainloader +1 or something?
2010-11-10T22:05:00.000Z	IdleOne	tiberious_	to be honest I have never edited grub.cfg and I am worried I am going to break everything
2010-11-10T22:06:00.000Z	IdleOne	tiberious_	basically I installed Ubuntu but the windows7 install is not showing up in grub as a boot option.
