2010-04-09T14:26:00.000Z	farsight		can anyone offer a simple explanation for the most effective way to autologin on xchat start up, where the nickserv name is farsight?
2010-04-09T14:27:00.000Z	farsight		I am somewhat confused by where I add /msg NickServ identify farsight <password>
2010-04-09T14:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	farsight	depends on the irc client you use. many have a dialog to just put you password
