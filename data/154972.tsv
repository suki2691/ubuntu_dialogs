2006-12-29T13:27:00.000Z	magic_ninja		whats the name of the gstreamer wav plugin (so i can use soundcoverter to convert to wave)
2006-12-29T13:27:00.000Z	alecjw	magic_ninja	i thought that gstreamer could play wav's out of the box
2006-12-29T13:28:00.000Z	magic_ninja	alecjw	it can play them...but for some reason sound converter won't convert them and gives me a gstreamer plugin error...i can get you the error if you like
