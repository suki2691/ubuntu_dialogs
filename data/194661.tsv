2007-01-26T10:38:00.000Z	Tonren		I just installed lighttpd, but I don't want it to boot up because I already have Apache.
2007-01-26T10:39:00.000Z	DBO	Tonren	the easiest way to mess with init.d stuff is to use sysv-rc-conf
2007-01-26T10:39:00.000Z	DBO	Tonren	sudo apt-get install sysv-rc-conf then sudo sysv-rc-conf
