2009-06-23T02:01:00.000Z	igneousquill		I'm working through a bash tutorial and it is asking me to add an alias to .bash_profile . I finally found the file and was able to open it, but I can't save the file.  It says I don't have the necessary permissions.
2009-06-23T02:02:00.000Z	igneousquill		so, how can I do it?
