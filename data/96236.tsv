My PC was online last 10-15 days. Today morning (5 min back) my PC looks dead and the same story like when I try to suspend. After push "power on", bios say: "pls, enter setup and fix the settings" - all settings was default. What is wrong and how to check this (which log file)?

2009-07-21T11:04:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	[R]	this is new PC, new Asus motherboard (something like P5Q) and as I said: there are 2 PC, yesterday evening both was ON, today morning the ubuntu PC looks dead. The other PC is ON - meaning no power down.
