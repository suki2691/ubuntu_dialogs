2009-08-02T21:12:00.000Z	mazda01	geekhut	ok, will try. thanks
2009-08-02T21:15:00.000Z	mazda01	geekhut	that was it, thank you. why is something like this not done off the batt when I install phpmyadmin? also, what is the command to add a password for root  for my mysql server?
2009-08-02T21:16:00.000Z	mazda01	geekhut	currently the root password for mysql server is blank. but I am trying to get into phpmyadmin and leaving root password blank gives me Access denied error? huh?
