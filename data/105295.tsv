2009-04-02T01:07:00.000Z	Jake1		Hi, just installed.  Auto detected my vid card and suggested a restricted driver but nothing for my Gigabyte onboard sound.  Where do I start to get the correct driver?
2009-04-02T01:09:00.000Z	Jake1		Any suggestions for finding the correct sound driver? Not sure where to start.
