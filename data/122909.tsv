2007-09-02T08:44:00.000Z	zaius		can someone tell me what the difference between alternate and desktop isos is?
2007-09-02T08:44:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	zaius	, alternate is simply a text based installer... desktop is the live cd.. with optional install via GUI
2007-09-02T08:45:00.000Z	zaius	Kr0ntab	/ nickrud: so desktop boots to a gui? does it fail back to curses?
2007-09-02T08:45:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	zaius	no...
