2009-08-14T01:21:00.000Z	KittyBoots		I am running ubuntu 9.04, when I make flash video full screen it hesitates, how to I fix this?
2009-08-14T01:23:00.000Z	VCoolio	KittyBoots	"it hesitates" <-- what do you mean? it plays badly or not at all?
2009-08-14T01:23:00.000Z	KittyBoots	VCoolio	it plays but very terrible
2009-08-14T01:25:00.000Z	VCoolio	KittyBoots	ok then I quit, I'm no flash guru and besides I hate it; installing the adobe flash plugin from their site may help according to several in this room
