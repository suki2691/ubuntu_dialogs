2006-12-04T14:02:00.000Z	Corbeaux	adamdunn	Are there any RAID partitions on the HDD?
2006-12-04T14:07:00.000Z	adamdunn	Corbeaux	do you think it could be partitions that aren't mounted? Did the discrepancy equal a partition that wasn't mounted on the raid5?
2006-12-04T14:09:00.000Z	Corbeaux	adamdunn	I don't remember specifics but I remember one being 2x the size of the other and yes it was an unmounted ~10GB partition
