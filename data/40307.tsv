2009-12-23T20:02:00.000Z	Church	amelius	yeah, but for me - first time _as_ bad
2009-12-23T20:03:00.000Z	Church	amelius	half a day with 5 windows with ~ 8-10 tabs each, and 1-1.5gb already :/ .. not exactly comfortable on this laptop with just 1 gig :/
2009-12-23T20:05:00.000Z	amelius	Church	I've always stuck to the 32bit LTS releases, but I feel your pain... Firefox is just not something you can use intensively for days on end without restarting it
