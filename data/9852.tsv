2011-11-26T12:42:00.000Z	poyntz		is it possible to install oneiric without overriding grub?
2011-11-26T12:42:00.000Z	poyntz		so I could install off live CD, but then, if it overrides the current grub, I'd then have to reinstall windows 7?
2011-11-26T12:43:00.000Z	markkkz	poyntz	I think I was able to do that but I had 2 disks, so 1 disk had Windows+Natty, the other disk had Oneiric. I jus switch disk prio on BIOS and the grub comes out different.
