2009-01-30T09:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	_VIM_	I haven't yet packaged the alpha version - theoretically we'll have a final of the new one that I can put in a PPA / backports soon.
2009-01-30T09:00:00.000Z	_VIM_	tonyyarusso	you're a Kompozer dev?
2009-01-30T09:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	_VIM_	no, just the packager for Ubuntu.  (I make the .deb, but don't write the code)
