2008-08-11T14:34:00.000Z	Wicks		Hi - would anyone happy to know where I would set DNS servers in Hardy via the terminal?
2008-08-11T14:35:00.000Z	unop	Wicks	in the /etc/resolv.conf file
2008-08-11T14:35:00.000Z	Wicks	unop	does it matter that that file is yet to exist on my system?
2008-08-11T14:36:00.000Z	unop	Wicks	errm, yes possibly .. it's quite an important thing in name resolution
