2012-07-25T05:15:00.000Z	b0nghitter		my cpu does not support VT-x
2012-07-25T05:15:00.000Z	escott	b0nghitter	then you can only have 32bit guests
2012-07-25T05:17:00.000Z	b0nghitter	escott	that's fine, im only emulating a cisco asa.. but its telling me i have an unpatched version of qemu, i just used apt-get install qemu-kvm.. im hopijng i dont need something else that "host a vm" during the os install would install
