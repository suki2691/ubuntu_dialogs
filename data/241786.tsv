2005-04-26T05:20:00.000Z	declan		Greetings from Dublin. I've looked through a lot of posts here and there, about getting my dvd playback working, but I'm not getting anywhere.  The problem is that as soon as I put the dvd in the drive, the system mounts it as a CD-Rom.  I've tried doing symbolic links and all that, but to no avail.  Anybody want to try and help?
