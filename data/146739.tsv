2007-05-18T06:44:00.000Z	cables	grimboy_uk	you can't do multiline in any IRC client without sending multiple messages.
2007-05-18T06:45:00.000Z	grimboy_uk	cables	Yeah, but I'm sure there's a way to get a multiline input.
2007-05-18T06:46:00.000Z	cables	grimboy_uk	ok, I know what you mean, but I don't know how to enable it. Go to #xchat, maybe they'll know...
