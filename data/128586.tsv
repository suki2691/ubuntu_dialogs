2007-07-08T14:12:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Frogzoo	Dark_Apostrophe, debian stable or testing would be very much incompatible as the libraries are so old, but sid is usually close, except that a looot of stuff gets ubuntu patches
2007-07-08T14:12:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Frogzoo	Dark_Apostrophe: i know when i wanted to install frets on fire i could get it from sid's repo and have it work just fine
