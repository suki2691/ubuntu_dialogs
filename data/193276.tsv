2007-05-17T14:17:00.000Z	The_Alexander		hello. can anybody help me installing jahshaka on Ubuntu Feisty?
2007-05-17T14:18:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	The_Alexander	I think it's broken atm, various threads about saying it segfaults on startup
2007-05-17T14:19:00.000Z	The_Alexander	Frogzoo	so Ill have to wait until they repair it?
2007-05-17T14:20:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	The_Alexander	I guess so, but I doubt it will be too long as the devs seem aware of it
