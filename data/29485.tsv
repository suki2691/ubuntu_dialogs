2010-07-04T06:23:00.000Z	oberverbrecher		So I am not allowed to chat thanks to spammers if I do not give my E-Mail address to Freenode. That's the same way the western governments react to terrorism. MORE CONTROL
2010-07-04T06:23:00.000Z	bastidrazor	oberverbrecher	complain in #freenode or #staff .. this channel does not care about your issues with registering
2010-07-04T06:42:00.000Z	oberverbrecher	bastidrazor	so you have just been trolling? because what of these things that mean trolling did occur in #freenode?
2010-07-04T06:43:00.000Z	bastidrazor	oberverbrecher	this is not #freenode. it is #ubuntu and you crying about not wanting to register has nothing to do with ubuntu support or the /topic here.
