2011-05-17T00:10:00.000Z	lunavorax_mini		I just booted an Ubuntu CD on my computer and installed in ram the openssh-server package so I can access via ssh to the hdd of the machine without intalling ubuntu. Problem is, I don't know what login and password to use as  both "root" and "ubuntu" with no password doesn't work.

2011-05-17T00:12:00.000Z	quiescens	lunavorax_mini	sudo passwd ubuntu
