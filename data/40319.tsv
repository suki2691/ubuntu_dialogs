2009-12-23T01:55:00.000Z	Haura		Hello there. Well I have the following problem: When I download subtitles, I can see only some strange symbols when I open them. What do I need to see them correctly? codecs?
2009-12-23T01:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Haura	probably fonts
2009-12-23T01:56:00.000Z	Haura	ActionParsnip	oh thank you, how could I get them?
2009-12-23T01:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Haura	you'll need to see what font is used somehow first
