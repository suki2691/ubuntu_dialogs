2009-10-20T23:12:00.000Z	jimdandy		Hello all! I am using ubuntu-desktop (Jaunty), and I installed samba. I have noticed my hostname is visible to networks I connect to. Is samba responsible for this?

2009-10-20T23:14:00.000Z	jimdandy	WanHouse	So if I uninstalled samba, this query wouldn't return anything?
2009-10-20T23:15:00.000Z	WanHouse	jimdandy	stop samba and test it.
