2009-10-04T12:27:00.000Z	draconis	eepberries	err, I mean redirect it to a file. cvt {parameters} >> /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-10-04T12:28:00.000Z	draconis	eepberries	then it will be at the bottom of xorg.conf
2009-10-04T12:39:00.000Z	eepberries	draconis	well, when i set the display resolution to "800x600" in xorg.conf, when i retarted, ubuntu told me it was running in a "low graphics mode" and i selected for it to create a new profile based on my hardware. then i restarted
