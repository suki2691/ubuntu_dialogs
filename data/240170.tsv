2006-06-27T16:09:00.000Z	seamoon		Ok, I tried mplayer and mpegs seem to work but not AVI's. "Player xine not running" is the message I receive.
2006-06-27T16:09:00.000Z	seamoon		Also, I get no sound.
2006-06-27T16:11:00.000Z	seamoon		Anyone knows why avi's wont work in mplayer for me? It says "player xine not running".
