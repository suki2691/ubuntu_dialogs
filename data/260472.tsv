2009-09-15T08:13:00.000Z	Oneshade		can anyone help me on a ubuntu server edition (already installed, and with a LAMP already on it) get it to connect to the internet? whenever I try to use the ping command on any outside adress it wont work. Im new to linux, and this is a fresh install so barely anything has been changed (except it has a static ip set up)

2009-09-15T08:16:00.000Z	jmarsden	Oneshade	Can you pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces (which you edited to set the static IP) please?
2009-09-15T08:20:00.000Z	jmarsden	Oneshade	Seriously, can you /join #ubuntu-server and I will try to work with you on the server networking issue you are having in that channel ?
