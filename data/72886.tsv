2009-09-05T17:47:00.000Z	evilbuntu		I have a weird question. I'm unable to display some content in a web-browser, and I'm not sure why. I think it's java-related, but i'd like to know for sure. Is there something I can do to see what content is broken/unviewable on a webpage?
2009-09-05T17:48:00.000Z	evilbuntu		it's firefox 3.0.13
