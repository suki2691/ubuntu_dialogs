2009-11-14T16:48:00.000Z	teolicy		Hi. Is it possible to combine contacts in Empathy? (same person from two different IM services?)
2009-11-14T16:49:00.000Z	sobersabre	teolicy	I think so... but only the grouping thing.
2009-11-14T16:50:00.000Z	teolicy	sobersabre	om26er: What does that mean? Say I have a friend called Mike on MSN and ICQ, I create a group called "Mike"?
2009-11-14T16:53:00.000Z	sobersabre	teolicy	I don't exactly what you mean, but if you have several similar usernames from diff. services, they appear in pidgin as several users.
