2007-08-16T06:43:00.000Z	Fa-sum`		i have a problem with alsa in ubuntu, it doesn't work. i reinstalled feisty some days ago, and in the previous installation i also had this problem, which solved itself, i think with some upgrade. now alsa doesn't work again, as i said. do you have idea of the solution?
