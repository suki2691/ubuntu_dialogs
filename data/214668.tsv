2006-01-08T14:21:00.000Z	blue-frog	psycode	alien, look in synaptic first if u find it
2006-01-08T14:22:00.000Z	psycode	blue-frog	the package exist for debian only in an old version which doesnt perform what i need, and i cant compile the source..
2006-01-08T14:25:00.000Z	blue-frog	psycode	use alien then to "translate" the rpm
