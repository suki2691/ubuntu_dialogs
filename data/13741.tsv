2012-02-20T12:56:00.000Z	LigH	theadmin	I believe there are several boot themes installed, just Synaptic did not list those with "edu" in the middle of a package name. / apt-getter: I believe "Manage bootloader themes" is the button I will click and see...
2012-02-20T13:07:00.000Z	LigH	theadmin	I'll try a forum post, to continue with my daily work. :)
