2005-09-25T08:18:00.000Z	firestor1		I'm having trouble finding linux-image 2.6.13 in synaptic and apt-get....I only seem to have linux-image 2.6.11...Any hints?
2005-09-25T08:18:00.000Z	Seveas	firestor1	2.6.11 packages are broken
2005-09-25T08:19:00.000Z	firestor1	Seveas	2.6.11 has *mostly* worked for me...what specifics are broken? and why isn't there a 2.6.13 yet?
2005-09-25T08:20:00.000Z	Seveas	firestor1	2.6.11 was a testbuild with known issues
