2008-01-26T10:36:00.000Z	IcemanV9	hdevalence-	it would be better if you could use ssh instead of telnet ... sudo aptitude install openssh-server
2008-01-26T10:37:00.000Z	hdevalence-	IcemanV9	I have ssh, but Id like telnet /because/ it's unencrypted
2008-01-26T10:41:00.000Z	IcemanV9	hdevalence-	ah. dunno about telnet with X then.
