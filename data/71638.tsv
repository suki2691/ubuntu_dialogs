2008-12-10T00:12:00.000Z	balau	cQ	when you release the right button while highlighting a menu entry, you perform the action on that menu
2008-12-10T00:15:00.000Z	balau	cQ	i think firefox is opening the context menu exactly while you are releasing the right button, so you don't see the menu but you selected the "random" entry that appears beneath the cursor. I don't know how to fix this beside keeping the right button down
