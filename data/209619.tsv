2007-10-13T07:13:00.000Z	OoO		I'm thinking that my question may have been overlooked, so I'll ask again.  If nobody answers, then the room is probably too busy, and I understand.  :)
2007-10-13T07:13:00.000Z	OoO		I am running Ubuntu Server 7.06.  I understand how to create users.  Question:  I want to create a user who can't look at other users' home folders.  I can create users with no administrator priveleges, but they can still look at any folder they want.  How do I prevent this?  I used the 'adduser' command.  PM me with an answer if possible because I will not be able to pay attention to this window at all times.
