2009-11-09T10:40:00.000Z	dsnyders	nick	will rtorrent be able to resume my ktorrent download?
2009-11-09T10:41:00.000Z	nick	dsnyders	if you add the torrent manually and put the temporary file. it should re-check the file and download. but i'm not sure
2009-11-09T10:42:00.000Z	dsnyders	nick	philh, thanks for the help.  I'll look into transmission and rtorrent.
