2008-07-02T20:52:00.000Z	pianohacker		dpkg had a problem installing some perl libxml bindings, and now trys to install them every time I run apt, and fails. How do I clear them out?
2008-07-02T20:52:00.000Z	Red_Wraith	pianohacker	did you try sudo apt-get purge [name of bindings] ?
2008-07-02T20:55:00.000Z	pianohacker	Red_Wraith	Thanks, that works
2008-07-02T20:55:00.000Z	Red_Wraith	pianohacker	try rebooting and see if it tries to reinstall.
