2011-04-09T04:57:00.000Z	doomrobo		 is it possible to install 32-bit software in 64-bit ubuntu?
2011-04-09T04:58:00.000Z	doomrobo		Also, the software won't show up in apt because it's the wrong architecture
2011-04-09T04:58:00.000Z	dustin_	doomrobo	 what you trying to do?
2011-04-09T04:59:00.000Z	doomrobo	dustin_	i added the dockbar ppa but it has no installation candidate in apt because it's 32 bit
