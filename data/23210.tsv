2011-01-13T12:14:00.000Z	yuler		Why do not see any results for "tidy" in searching in Ubuntu Software Center?  I see 27 with "apt-cache search tidy"?  Are these processes not the same?
2011-01-13T12:14:00.000Z	rww	yuler	no, they're not
2011-01-13T12:17:00.000Z	yuler	rww	ah, apt-cache is used by synaptic.  Silly moi.
2011-01-13T12:17:00.000Z	rww	yuler	actually, I think synaptic has its own thing too, but searches the same fields as apt-cache
