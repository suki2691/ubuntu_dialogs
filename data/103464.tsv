2008-02-08T04:36:00.000Z	Owleto	kavelot	yes, pretty easy to install codecs through the installer
2008-02-08T04:36:00.000Z	kavelot	Owleto	but can I install them without having the videos that needs the codec I want?
2008-02-08T04:37:00.000Z	Owleto	kavelot	yes... enable the repos first, then just select what you need
