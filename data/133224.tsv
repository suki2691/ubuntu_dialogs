2007-05-25T05:35:00.000Z	Slart	gescape	so you should be able to turn into a server
2007-05-25T05:37:00.000Z	gescape	Slart	and what about a dual boot during installation? I do have a FC6 and XP at the moment. If I would install ubuntu now will it recognize win part and let me configure dual boot during the installation?
