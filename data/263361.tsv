2011-04-06T06:22:00.000Z	will	Verzor	i have no idea. the rest of the episodes from the same series sound absolutely fine. i've got pretty good hearing and i know radio shows often increase the speed of songs, and this is a radioshow turned into a TV programme (the ricky gervais show), so either it's an conversion error on their end, or deliberately trying to pack in more
2011-04-06T06:23:00.000Z	will	Verzor	that or i'm finally having a tea and jam toast fuelled breakdown
2011-04-06T06:27:00.000Z	will	Verzor	i'd have absolutely no idea how to do that?
