2006-10-29T13:14:00.000Z	fnf		Anyone has an idea of what is the purpose of linux-server and linux-image-server in my Dapper server installation ?. Ubuntu seemed to have included it by default in 2.6.15.26, but it's no loger necessary after upgrading 10 15.27.
2006-10-29T06:00:00.000Z	fnf		Hi, anyone has any info on configuring Edgy's upstart ?. I've tried looking at the Wiki pages and Googled (not excessively though) but couldn't find an answer yet.

2006-10-29T06:01:00.000Z	lupine_85	fnf	no :D, but you could look at the upstsart-sysvinit package (IIRC) - it presumably contains scripts to make upstart act like sysvinit, so you could probably learn a lot from it
