2006-06-21T13:35:00.000Z	hoittr		Excuse me, but I have either (A. Found a bug in Dapper) or (B. Am a complete idiot)... When I use the remote desktop tool after changing my default resolution from 1024x768 to 1600x1200 and re-run the remote desktop tool. The vncserver still uses a resolution of 1024x768, and I can not remotely access all of my screen. 1. How can I fix this. 2. If it IS a bug, how do I report it?

2006-06-21T13:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	hoittr	file a new bug, and give a link to #19284 in your explanation
2006-06-21T13:41:00.000Z	Madpilot	hoittr	"if in doubt, file" - it can always be marked as a duplicate later
