2007-01-02T06:15:00.000Z	Crypt		hi, can anyone answer a pre-installation question for me?
2007-01-02T06:15:00.000Z	Crypt		since PPC support seems to be like it wont be supported anymore, is it still worth dual booting Ubuntu and OSX?
2007-01-02T06:17:00.000Z	Crypt		Dual Core = Intel. I'm running a Powerbook with a G4 PPC processor
