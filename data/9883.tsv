2011-08-31T21:36:00.000Z	blsh0p		 hey guys i had a question about virtual box, anyone here know how to use it?
2011-08-31T21:37:00.000Z	blsh0p		I am currently dual booting windows and ubuntu, but i want to put the windows os that i already use on a virtual box file
2011-08-31T21:37:00.000Z	blsh0p		how can i run it on the virtual box instead of dual booting, while keeping the same os and all its files
