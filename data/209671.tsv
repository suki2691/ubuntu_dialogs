2010-11-22T19:38:00.000Z	hongry_		good morning all.
2010-11-22T19:39:00.000Z	hongry_		I'm trying to install the linux-headers package for my kernel, and I get "couldn't find package linux-headers-2.6.35-22-generic".  Can someone help me with this error please?
2010-11-22T19:41:00.000Z	hongry_		When I do an "apt-get update", I receive several errors like "Unable to connect to packages.linuxmint.com:http".  Can someone please help?
