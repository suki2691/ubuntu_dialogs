2009-12-25T12:16:00.000Z	Er1K		I'm giving my 12yo Autistic son a DV camcorder in the morning and am looking for some Linux video editing software for him.  Core requirements are low learning curve, low system requirements, native handling of mpeg2/mpeg4 files with no "import", "export", or "conversion".  Nice-to-haves would be built-in support for DVD authoring.  PiTiVi and LiVES look like the front-runners ATM.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.
