2011-05-05T13:33:00.000Z	Kostaplenty		Hi there! I've installed apache server. When I try to browse to a file it downloads it instead of viewing it, what can be the problem ?
2011-05-05T13:34:00.000Z	Aginor	Kostaplenty	what type of file is it?
2011-05-05T13:35:00.000Z	Aginor	Kostaplenty	you need to install php to have apache be able to run it for you
2011-05-05T13:38:00.000Z	Aginor	Kostaplenty	and have you enabled php as it states in the guide?
