2008-04-07T04:13:00.000Z	duli		Please, help: I was trying to recover the Windows mbr through Ubuntu with ms-sys --mbr /dev/sda1 instead of /dev/sda, and now my windows partition is unbootable...

2008-04-07T04:15:00.000Z	duli	binarical-app	Hum, ok... I'll try that. Tks for now
2008-04-07T05:08:00.000Z	duli	binarical-app	just solved the broken winodws boot sector with testdisk (backup bs function). Thanks
