2012-01-30T16:51:00.000Z	LjL	zennez0009	stuff in /home never gets removed on uninstall
2012-01-30T16:51:00.000Z	LjL	zennez0009	it's configuration data that you might want to keep, so it stays
2012-01-30T16:52:00.000Z	LjL	zennez0009	the packaging system has no way of knowing what stuff in /home belongs to a given application
