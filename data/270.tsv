2012-11-29T11:26:00.000Z	kn0ne	dr_willis	will that help me locate and install a PPD file?
2012-11-29T11:27:00.000Z	kn0ne	dr_willis	The printer is a MG3120, Ubuntu 12.10 can install and detect it without a problem, but I don't have that luck with the cli. Cannon's website says they do not have the driver, and the driver comes with the operating system.
