2006-07-25T13:59:00.000Z	Deeghetal		Hello everyone. I'm a completely new Ubuntu user switching from XP. I'm reading the documentation right now but I'm sure I'll have questions later. ;)
2006-07-25T14:01:00.000Z	Deeghetal		I was told that in Ubuntu you shouldn't be logged in as root to install packages and should instead use sudo. Is it BAD to be in root?
2006-07-25T14:02:00.000Z	Deeghetal		It never prompted me to select a root password though is it the same as my user pass?
2006-07-25T14:02:00.000Z	mc__	Deeghetal	i normally use root if have to execute more then 1 command
