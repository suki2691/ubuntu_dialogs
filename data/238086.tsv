2009-05-15T22:34:00.000Z	dev_nul		i have an older version of ubuntu on cd. i planned to install it, then upgrade to <jaunty?>. but when i edited the sources.list and tried to do an upgrade i got errors about the libc version not being able to be installed.
2009-05-15T22:35:00.000Z	dev_nul		gusty/gutsy <sp>
