2009-01-21T09:27:00.000Z	rebel_gui		can i kill tty1?
2009-01-21T09:27:00.000Z	mindrape	rebel_gui	- it will probably revive itself... from PID 1
2009-01-21T09:28:00.000Z	mindrape	rebel_gui	- why do you wanna kill it?
2009-01-21T09:31:00.000Z	rebel_gui	mindrape	because it is unresponsive, once in a blue moon it locks up entirely, i can kill the processes running on it and its still stuck there, i would like to reload it
