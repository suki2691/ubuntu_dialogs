2007-12-30T19:25:00.000Z	qwaz		Hi, would someone help me?  I put a script in /bin and when I try to execute it I get permission denied.  I chown'ed it to myself but still won't work
2007-12-30T19:25:00.000Z	RB2	qwaz	Did you chmod it to give it executable ?
2007-12-30T19:28:00.000Z	RB2	qwaz	It's chmod +x
2007-12-30T19:28:00.000Z	RB2	qwaz	-x takes away the executable permission
