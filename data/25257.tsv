2012-02-06T14:43:00.000Z	sam_		i'm trying to report a bug against the kernel, but i can't work out what the package is called
2012-02-06T14:43:00.000Z	sam_		when i go to the "select a package" dialog in launchpad and type "kernel", it says "Too many matches. Please try to narrow your search"
2012-02-06T14:43:00.000Z	sam_		does anyone know what package i should be reporting against?
2012-02-06T14:44:00.000Z	oCean	sam_	linux-image, or linux-image-generic
