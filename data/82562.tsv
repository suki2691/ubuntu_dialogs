2008-09-18T01:31:00.000Z	Reformer81		I've installed Ubuntu 8.04 on a system that does not have internet access.  I would like to know how I would go about downloading packages and updates to put on a CD and then bring them to the other computer to install them.  I'm particularly interested in installing the Nvidia drivers and multimedia support.  I have already looked at AptOnCD, but it doesn't include any of the restricted packages I'm most interested in.

2008-09-18T01:33:00.000Z	Reformer81	guntbert	Did you not even read my request?
2008-09-18T01:33:00.000Z	guntbert	Reformer81	I read it every time, and apt-on-cd will be exactly the tool you need
