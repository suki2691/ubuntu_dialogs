2007-09-28T07:16:00.000Z	BrianV		** question ** Hi all - I just mounted an external ext3 drive on my system. However, it only mounts as root, and 'sudo chown' tells me I don't have the permissions to chabg it to my user. How do I make it writable by non-root users?

2007-09-28T07:18:00.000Z	BrianV	MasterShrek	thank you, but I tried it. The command executes, but doesn't affect the permissions at all - they remain 755 or whatever
2007-09-28T07:18:00.000Z	MasterShrek	BrianV	mount it as kitche said
