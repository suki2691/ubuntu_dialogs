2006-11-06T14:08:00.000Z	mitrovarr	BeanBag	 I made it from source, but not the pay version.
2006-11-06T14:09:00.000Z	mitrovarr	BeanBag	 You get the source from the CVS repository; they have instructions on how to get it on the cedega site.  There's good instructions on how to compile it online, as well as scripts to help.
2006-11-06T14:10:00.000Z	mitrovarr	BeanBag	 the compiled version is not as good though because it doesn't have the copy protection things.  Really, it quite sucks.  I never got it to run any games more than incredibly half-assed.
