2010-06-03T20:41:00.000Z	hudnix		Hi. After a reboot this morning my system is stuck in low graphics mode, no matter what I do
2010-06-03T20:41:00.000Z	hudnix		nvidia settings and system settings both think I'm at 1024x768, but it's not so
2010-06-03T20:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hudnix	reinstall the nvidia driver
2012-06-30T05:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hudnix	have you tested the RAM health
