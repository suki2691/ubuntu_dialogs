2010-02-21T04:18:00.000Z	omac		Hello everyone, this is day two after updating from 9.04 to 9.10...  I still haven't gotten pwmconfig/fancontrol to work as before.  I've been to a few fancontrol pages, but I don't see any clear answers because there are rumors it could kill my pc if I don't do this right.
2010-02-21T04:20:00.000Z	omac		!fancontrol
2010-02-21T04:20:00.000Z	omac		!pwmconfig
