2005-03-28T15:34:00.000Z	sankito		i have ubuntu running on my laptop, and i've had it hooked up to an external monitor for about a week and it's been working fine. i just restarted and now it's not sending a signal to the monitor. any ideas?
2005-03-28T15:35:00.000Z	sankito		did you add universe to your synaptic package manager?

2005-03-28T15:35:00.000Z	Seveas	sankito	at least that's my experience :)
