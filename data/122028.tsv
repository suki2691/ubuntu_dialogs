2008-04-01T20:38:00.000Z	Christina18		Is there a easy way to remove html tags from within a query - like SELECT fieldwithhtmltags AS fieldwithouthtmltags FROM randomtable ?
2008-04-01T20:38:00.000Z	soundray	Christina18	perhaps you should ask that question in #mysql
2008-04-01T20:39:00.000Z	Christina18	soundray	you r right! ;-9
