2011-01-29T14:53:00.000Z	red2kic	moah	Some applications are GUI. Some appliations ar for terminal.
2011-01-29T14:53:00.000Z	moah	red2kic	i know that, but also terminal applications sometimes get a menu entry.
2011-01-29T14:55:00.000Z	red2kic	moah	Yes. And some packages are just back-ends for certain apps, such as plugins. No need for menu. If you know what you're installing, then you're likely to know where it can be found in.
