2011-03-02T17:18:00.000Z	Ishwon		need an advice. is there a way of converting an MS Access Database to OpenOffice?
2011-03-02T17:19:00.000Z	rigved	Ishwon	use openoffice to open it. no need to convert, afaik
2011-03-02T17:21:00.000Z	Ishwon	rigved	openoffice does not recognize the file format. it doesn't open. i tried to see if a connector exists, but none avail.
