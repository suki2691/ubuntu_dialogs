2008-12-23T15:51:00.000Z	jacobw-uk		how can i stop this happening, i.e. so the user does not have to enter their password in the process of starting up the computer

2008-12-23T15:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	jacobw-uk	 i see that Q get asked a lot.. but no idea on  a work around. I enter my password anyway . since i have a lot of OTHER passwords in the keyring then just the wireless
