2009-03-29T14:58:00.000Z	eaxxae	DkySven	the libraries and installed packages have dependences, when you upgrade... the list of dependences/etc changes I think. It'd be much easier to just do a fresh install after backing up your data
2009-03-29T14:58:00.000Z	eaxxae	DkySven	why are you trying to downgrade ?
2009-03-29T15:00:00.000Z	eaxxae	DkySven	can you backup and reinstall ?
