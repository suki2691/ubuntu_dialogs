2005-01-22T09:32:00.000Z	zeratha		Need help with sound! I am getting Sorry, no mixer elements and/or devices found. I've tried the gst-register-0.8, but it didn't do it. I get errors in XMMS and totem as well.
2005-01-22T09:34:00.000Z	zeratha		emu10k..... Audigy...... Worked fine before updating the system. I rolled back the kernel but that didn't help.
2005-01-22T09:36:00.000Z	zeratha		I've got all the emu10k, soundcore, and oss modules listing, but no alsa mods. I can't find them in lib/modules either.
