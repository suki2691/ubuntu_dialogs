2006-12-30T11:35:00.000Z	Jon335		I'm running Ubuntu Edgy. None of the progress bars show. If there is a number in the progress bar (ie percentage) it gets distorted once the bar passes over it. What should I do?

2006-12-30T11:36:00.000Z	Jon335	_Adramelech_	It's the default theme
2006-12-30T11:37:00.000Z	Jon335	_Adramelech_	It's like that on the live CD too
