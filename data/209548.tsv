2007-05-16T08:14:00.000Z	returnnull		hm, well, i'm just going to remove the evolution packages, since my problem seems related to evolution, and i use thunderbird anyway.
2007-05-16T08:15:00.000Z	returnnull		if i mark the ubuntu-desktop package for deletion in synaptic, will everything go to hell? or will i survive until it's time to update
2007-05-16T08:15:00.000Z	LjL	returnnull	it will be fine, at least until you try using the "autoremove" function of apt-get
2007-05-16T08:16:00.000Z	LjL	returnnull	no, if you install it again, evolution will get reinstalled too.
