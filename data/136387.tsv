2007-08-02T14:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Eoghan	Yes it is a bug that they have left unfixed for months and the maintainer should be shot because you will also notice that you can't remove it with apt-get
2007-08-02T14:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Eoghan	It is a bug in Ubuntu's packaging of vmware-player there is a bug report on it that has a solution for getting the package to uninstall in the comments
2007-08-02T14:23:00.000Z	Eoghan	Jordan_U	right, i'll look up the bug report
