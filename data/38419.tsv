2010-04-03T16:17:00.000Z	ammulu		I've ubuntu 9.04...it isn't detecting the contents of the cd...what do i do?
2010-04-03T16:17:00.000Z	Idlehead	ammulu	try to see if another pc is recognizing the contents of the cd
2010-04-03T16:19:00.000Z	Idlehead	ammulu	when you insert the CD does it show that there is a CD or does the CD not show up at all
2010-04-03T16:21:00.000Z	Idlehead	ammulu	could it be that the CD is protected with some kind of copy protection?
