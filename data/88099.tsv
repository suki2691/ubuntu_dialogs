2012-11-03T06:36:00.000Z	FroMaster		New to ubuntu and wondering where i should put a new apache vhost... I'd usually put it in /var/www/<vhostdir> but ubuntu has the default site set to /var/www/  . What's the recommended location to put vhosts dirs?

2012-11-03T06:37:00.000Z	FroMaster	psusi	there's not a ubuntu convention i should adhere to?
