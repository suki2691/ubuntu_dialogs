2004-11-18T15:08:00.000Z	volvoguy		at least i didn't "paradigm shift" my server. buzzwords never seem to make sense. like the line in "A Princess Bride" - "That word you keep using. I do not think it means what you think it means." :-)
2004-11-18T15:10:00.000Z	volvoguy		ok. back to work. we *kinda* have a gui to set up smb shares in Hoary, but we have to do it manually in Warty, correct?
