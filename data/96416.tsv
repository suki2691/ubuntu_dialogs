2008-03-30T07:15:00.000Z	wil		I want to download vmware player, but the version in the repositort wont install... it says that it is not compatible with my hardware. I see some versions listed on the website and was wondering if I should aim for .rpm or .tar?

2008-03-30T07:17:00.000Z	wil	andash	thanks, but i dont need anything advanced, i use virtualbox and love it, I just have one .vmdk file that I need to open
2008-03-30T07:20:00.000Z	andash	wil	well try downloading the .tar then, its probably just ./configure, make, sudo make install
