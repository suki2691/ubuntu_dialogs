2005-12-24T13:27:00.000Z	dooglus	sjb34	see the 'session' menu in the gdm login screen?  select it there, and gdm will ask you if you want to change the default
2005-12-24T13:29:00.000Z	sjb34	dooglus	Will that affect VNC too, or just local sessions?
2005-12-24T13:29:00.000Z	dooglus	sjb34	I don't know.  I don't think vnc has anything to do with gdm though, so probably not.
