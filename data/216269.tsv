2007-11-22T21:44:00.000Z	Rowan		Does anyone else get a slow load after logging in with GNOME and GUTSY. I tried changing the uconf and stuff but it still seems to be doing it...
2007-11-22T21:45:00.000Z	DShepherd	Rowan	i find that having tomboy applet kinda slows up gnome.. but not that much
2007-11-22T21:45:00.000Z	Rowan	ikonia	and DShepherd, theres tons of threads on it, some with over 25 pages :S, oh well, i might just downgrade to feisty, nothing but problems with Gutsy for me
