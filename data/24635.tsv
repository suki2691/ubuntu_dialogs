2010-11-07T14:33:00.000Z	lavish		hi all. I'm looking for a way to deny users to change system time. Can you help me?
2010-11-07T14:35:00.000Z	rigved	lavish	do you have a administrator account on the said machine?
2010-11-07T14:36:00.000Z	rigved	lavish	if yes, then you can untick the option "Administer System" for all the other users except yours. this way, only you can set the system clock.
2010-11-07T15:12:00.000Z	lavish	rigved	sorry I've been busy :\ I'm quite sure I tried that way, but it didn't work. Just le t me start the vm again :)
