2006-07-14T10:08:00.000Z	Dial_tone		is there a way to make certain filetypes appear a given color in ls output?
2006-07-14T10:09:00.000Z	Dial_tone		thanks
2006-07-14T10:10:00.000Z	Dial_tone		my ls output is colored but mp3s show white unless they're marked +x then they're green. I'd like them to be blue or green even when not +x
