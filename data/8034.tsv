2011-11-11T02:20:00.000Z	Mysterytrain	EvilResistance	able to install ubuntu remotely
2011-11-11T02:21:00.000Z	EvilResistance	Mysterytrain	 no, there's no way to install ubuntu remotely afaik.  you can *upgrade* remotely, but i dont hink you can install remotely, as you actually need the installation medium at the system
