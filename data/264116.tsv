2004-10-03T09:15:00.000Z	ninj1		how come I can't build GNOME stuff? what package do I need to install to get the gtk/glib pkgconfig files?
2004-10-03T09:16:00.000Z	tvon|x31	ninj1	what are you trying to build?
2004-10-03T09:17:00.000Z	tvon|x31	ninj1	you can run "apt-get build-dep <package>" to pull down everything you need to build <package>
2004-10-03T09:17:00.000Z	ninj1	tvon|x31	that's not a bad idea - I'll try that if this fails
