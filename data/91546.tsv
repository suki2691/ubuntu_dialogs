2009-10-07T00:56:00.000Z	d1gital		I am very confused right now.  Just returned from class (no one touched my machine)  and now all the buttons are disabled in firefox and i am no longer in the sudoers file.  any ideas on what might have happened?

2009-10-07T01:00:00.000Z	d1gital		i guess my best bet is to boot from a livecd, mount the drive, and put myself back in sudoers?
