2008-01-11T13:49:00.000Z	zenobius	bullgard4	for me, when i put in 1gb everything ran faster
2008-01-11T13:51:00.000Z	bullgard4	zenobius	Can you tell me how much faster, sujectively?
2008-01-11T13:52:00.000Z	zenobius	bullgard4	well, metacity didnt stutter is rendering as i dragged windows, apps take 1-3secs to load rather than 20secs, (some gnomes apps still take ages to load)....i can do more thigns at once without sttutered slowdown
