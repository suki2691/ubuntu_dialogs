2007-07-08T14:49:00.000Z	wavez		I'm having trouble getting ubuntu to boot with PXE
2007-07-08T14:49:00.000Z	wavez		we're trying to boot without a hard drive
2007-07-08T14:50:00.000Z	wavez		ubuntu wants to format the hard drive, even though there isn't one
2007-07-08T14:52:00.000Z	Frogzoo	wavez	you tried tftp access yourself? to check perms?
