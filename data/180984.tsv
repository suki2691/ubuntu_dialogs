2007-09-16T09:29:00.000Z	winbond		i have a pc with 4gigs of ram, and i want to test it, but the memory test thats on the install cd does not start, it hangs on black screen with the white underscore, what could be the cause?

2007-09-16T09:30:00.000Z	poningru		use more options and just type memtest after deleting everything else
2007-09-16T09:30:00.000Z	winbond	poningru	thats memtest on the cd
