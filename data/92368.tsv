2008-05-02T20:05:00.000Z	Jared`		I am having a freeze-issue with a new 8.04 install. When I'm presented with the language selection screen, my system appears non-responsive to keyboard commands (numlock will not turn off, arrow keys not functional). Is there a workaround I can use to install Server Edition?
