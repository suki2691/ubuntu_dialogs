2011-01-15T07:31:00.000Z	KM0201	alberto	for 8gig?.. maybe... but either one, fat32 or ntfs, will work fine
2011-01-15T07:32:00.000Z	alberto	KM0201	Yea but there are a lot of devices that will not recognize NTFS, like media players and older BIOS
2011-01-15T07:32:00.000Z	KM0201	alberto	well he didn't mention he had an old machine... and he'd alread said he was having a fat32 issue.
