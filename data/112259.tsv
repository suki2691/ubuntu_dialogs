2010-02-28T21:19:00.000Z	alzamabar	unop	thanks. This is a first cut, I know it's probably buggy, plus it should be tweaked for one's own environment. I'll join the channel
2010-02-28T21:20:00.000Z	alzamabar	unop	I'm typing /join #bash but nothing happens
2010-02-28T21:21:00.000Z	unop	alzamabar	 make sure you don't have any leading spaces before /join  -- and your irc client might have opened the channel in a separate tab or in the background
