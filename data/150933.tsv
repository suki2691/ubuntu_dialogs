2007-02-18T12:01:00.000Z	threeseas	spyke01	have you checked the respositories for audio conversion tools?
2007-02-18T12:02:00.000Z	spyke01	threeseas	i tried using soundconverter but the files are unplayable when converted to oog, mp3, or even wav
2007-02-18T12:04:00.000Z	threeseas	spyke01	windows media file... maybe find a windows box and convert it from there?
