2008-05-25T19:27:00.000Z	Treeh		Hello
2008-05-25T19:28:00.000Z	Treeh		This is a really basic question, but how do I merge the window selection bar on the bottom with the aplications bar on the top??
2008-05-25T19:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	Treeh	add the applets to the upper bar (window list; trash; workspace selector; and show desktop) and then get rid of the bottom bar
2008-05-25T19:30:00.000Z	Treeh	erUSUL	Aha, thanks a lot :)
