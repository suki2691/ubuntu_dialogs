2012-07-18T19:26:00.000Z	malibu		Hi there.  can anyone tell me WHY the kernel ppa isn't giving me the 3.2 kernel?  I'm stuck at 3.0
2012-07-18T19:27:00.000Z	malibu		By the way, this is for 11.10
2012-07-18T19:27:00.000Z	auronandace	malibu	3.2 is default in 12.04, you don't need a ppa
2012-07-18T19:28:00.000Z	malibu	auronandace	I have to use 11.10 for work
