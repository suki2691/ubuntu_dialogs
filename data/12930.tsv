2011-06-26T08:40:00.000Z	Kuzad		What does it mean when my system becomes unresponsive and the Caps-Lock key flashes?
2011-06-26T08:41:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Kuzad	you system has "locked up"
2011-06-26T08:41:00.000Z	Kuzad	ZykoticK9	yes, it locks up, but what sort of error would cause a full lockup? This has only been happening on 11.04, it never happened in 10.10 or 10.04
2011-06-26T08:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Kuzad	i'm not going to comment on that... sorry i have no suggestions.
