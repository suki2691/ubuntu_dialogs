2007-07-10T12:14:00.000Z	darwin81		I have a Realtek RTL8139 Ethernet controller. Network Setting detects a wired connection and appears to be connected, but I can't get online or ping my router or a website.

2007-07-10T12:16:00.000Z	Typwn	darwin81	I have the same setup. The way I got it working was shutting down the comp, unplugging the modem and router and letting them power cycle.
