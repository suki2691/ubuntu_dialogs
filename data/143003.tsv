2008-04-28T09:23:00.000Z	JohnPhys	tonyyarusso	 386 kernels work on any machine, it's just that the -generic kernels contain some more enhancements for the extra instruction sets.
2008-04-28T09:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	JohnPhys	right, but I know generic doesn't work on some, and wasn't sure which ones.
2008-04-28T09:24:00.000Z	JohnPhys	tonyyarusso	ah, ok.  Yeah, I'm not really sure.
