2011-08-17T21:22:00.000Z	milkpost		base system installs a bunch of crap
2011-08-17T21:24:00.000Z	negueba	milkpost	try the server edition
2011-08-17T21:25:00.000Z	milkpost	negueba	just installed that.  it's better (has a "virtual machine") type install but the vmware image is still like 600MB and trying to get it down for students to download for a class
