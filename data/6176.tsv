I was looking for something simple with a single playlist, queueing etc.... not the crazy advanced 'media center' type tools like audacious or rhythymbox or whatever other kitchen-sink options out there
2012-05-15T16:52:00.000Z	tomasm-		NOT something that requires 'importing' an entire media library, etc

2012-05-15T16:53:00.000Z	tomasm-	T_H_X	vlc for mp3's?????
