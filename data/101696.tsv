2009-10-29T08:11:00.000Z	lgc		How can I track the speed of my connection to any given site? I mean the latency, not the bandwidth.

2009-10-29T08:13:00.000Z	lgc	zedster	thanks. I just tried ping which I unduly dismissed for its simplicity. It does the job in fact. However, there's some other command that tracks every hop the data has to make from origin to destiny. That's the one I'm interested on now.
