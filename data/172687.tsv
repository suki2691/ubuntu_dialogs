2006-07-28T13:27:00.000Z	zax123		Hi guys, I just d/led 6.06 Server and hit "Install to Hard Disk" when the CD booted and it gives me "Err=2, Invalid Compressed Format" when it tries to decompress the kernel.  Any ideas?
2006-07-28T13:28:00.000Z	zax123		There weren't any errors on download... came in smoothly on a 10megabit line...
2006-07-28T13:28:00.000Z	zax123		But I guess I'll re-download and re-burn
2006-07-28T13:28:00.000Z	mkns	zax123	- does sound like a duff download, unfortunately.  have you checked the md5 checksum?
