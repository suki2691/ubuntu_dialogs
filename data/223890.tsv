2008-01-13T18:06:00.000Z	th0r	kyle_	usually by installing kde, but you might get away with just installing the libqt
2008-01-13T18:08:00.000Z	th0r	kyle_	using synaptic, just like any other package
2008-01-13T18:09:00.000Z	th0r	kyle_	I think it is called libqt3-mt, but that might not be enough...never tried to run qt apps without kde
