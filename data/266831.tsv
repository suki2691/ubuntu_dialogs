2009-06-07T19:02:00.000Z	Nicky65463		Guys, I was just wondering if it is possible to boot a usb stick using heirens boot cd
2009-06-07T19:03:00.000Z	Nicky65463		basically I want to install ubuntu server but the machine does not allow me to boot from a usb
2009-06-07T19:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nicky65463	 ive seen some disrtos that have a boot-floppy type trick to boot from 'usb' on quirky machines.. but Ubuntu is not one of them.
2009-06-07T19:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nicky65463	 there may be some other ways.
