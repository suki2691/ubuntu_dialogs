2009-04-26T16:11:00.000Z	illmortal		Can someone assist me? I just finished installing the driver for my wireless card via ndiswrapper and then I modprobed ndiswrapper, rebooted, and I still cannot connect to the internet.
2009-04-26T16:11:00.000Z	illmortal		it's the BCM4318
2009-04-26T16:12:00.000Z	drbobb	illmortal	don't use ndiswrapper
2009-04-26T16:14:00.000Z	drbobb	illmortal	install b43-fwcutter and the b4318 runs
