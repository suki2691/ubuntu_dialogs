My KDE desktop is more than useful, it is essential as last week's updates damaged my Gnome. Now when I log into Gnome the splash screen appears, does its thing, then the panels try to load. The panels appear, flash eleven times, and then disappear. it leaves me with an empty brown desktop with nothing

If those keys are pressed while the panels are still flashing, the system returns me to the GDM login screen. If I wait until the panels stop flashing, ctrl-alt-backspace puts me at a login prompt in a shell. I have to then reboot to get back into GDM. Is this part of the reason the release date was moved back?
