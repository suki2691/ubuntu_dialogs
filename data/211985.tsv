2009-04-02T10:56:00.000Z	Nithrin1		I keep trying to view a file from the commandline with less <filename>, but it does not work and I get the following message: No catdoc available. What do I do?
2009-04-02T10:57:00.000Z	ZupZupper	Nithrin1	does more <filename> give different results?
2009-04-02T11:00:00.000Z	ZupZupper	Nithrin1	what kind of file are you trying to view?
2009-04-02T11:00:00.000Z	ZupZupper	Nithrin1	ahh, command line parsers aren't going to view that in the way you want to.  For that your best bet is to use Openoffice or any of the other GUI based programs
