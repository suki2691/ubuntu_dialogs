2007-10-01T11:04:00.000Z	alanapost		when i browse /media via filesystem, i see my external (which is not connected), cdrom(shortcut), and cdrom (no shortcut).. all are 4kb and clicking any of them opens a blank folder
2007-10-01T11:05:00.000Z	alanapost		i tried menus view-->reload and nothing changes
2007-10-01T11:06:00.000Z	eck	alanapost	i think that just means they're unused mount points, 4kb is the size of an empty directory
2007-10-01T11:06:00.000Z	alanapost	eck	usually the points/'folders' don't display unless something's loaded/mounted/connected whatever
