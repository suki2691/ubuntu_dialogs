2007-11-22T04:43:00.000Z	distatica		Hey folks, I just installed the latest version of ubuntu, and I'm trying to Update. It shows 88 updates, I click "Install Updates" and it asks me for a password, I don't enter one because I seem to recall that ubuntu doesn't use that, however it keeps checking updates and builds the list, but doesn't install. Any ideas why?
