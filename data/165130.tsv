2006-11-06T12:51:00.000Z	lullabud	Gabby_Hayes	 i'm trying to get it on a 64-bit xeon system.  *sigh*
2006-11-06T12:52:00.000Z	lullabud	Gabby_Hayes	 actually it installed pretty well.  dapper had trouble recognizing the raid array for me, but edgy recognized it fine.  no network though.
2006-11-06T12:52:00.000Z	lullabud	Gabby_Hayes	 what problems are you seeing?
