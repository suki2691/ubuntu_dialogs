2009-11-20T17:12:00.000Z	LjL	kkkduifjalsdd	to do what? "sleep" is a very simple timer: it'll terminate after n seconds
2009-11-20T17:14:00.000Z	kkkduifjalsdd	LjL	I mean it should show me the elapsed time, e.g. when making a presentation
2009-11-20T17:17:00.000Z	LjL	kkkduifjalsdd	i can't find anything like that for the terminal... could probably be hacked together as a script, though
