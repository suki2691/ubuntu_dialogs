2007-09-09T10:12:00.000Z	Filthpig	b0uncer	it'll take ten minutes to edit those apps away from the menus
2007-09-09T10:13:00.000Z	Filthpig		that's plenty
2007-09-09T10:13:00.000Z	b0uncer	Filthpig	not in my experience...and they keep on popping up whenever you install any program to Gnome or KDE, at both menus, and you'll have to re-clean them again
