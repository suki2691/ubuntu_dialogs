2010-03-22T13:15:00.000Z	leagris	meowbuntu	may be installing grub on the usb disk. You should search the web about that as it may require some understanding of grub bootloader
2010-03-22T13:17:00.000Z	leagris		a shame there is no PXE boot with wireless. I would have enhoyed providing free live ubuntu over the air to my neighbours :)
