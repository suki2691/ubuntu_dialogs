2011-12-24T07:02:00.000Z	Elems	tjiggi_fo	"to the left". right now its an extended partition surrounded by two unallocated spaces, which I'd like to have as one big unallocated space.

2011-12-24T07:10:00.000Z	Elems	tjiggi_fo	I'm going to try expanding the extended to the left then moving the ext4, so far its working. then I shoiuld be able to shrink the extended from the right. Thanks though
