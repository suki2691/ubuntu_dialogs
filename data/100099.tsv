2009-08-31T07:29:00.000Z	DaZ	dorkface	define applets
2009-08-31T07:30:00.000Z	dorkface	DaZ	I want to be able to click on the "networkManager Applet" in a small designated area, without the use of gnome-panel
2009-08-31T07:32:00.000Z	dorkface	DaZ	 I want to be able to uninstall gnome-panel, but still have access to the "NetworkManager Applet"
