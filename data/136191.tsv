2008-10-28T14:40:00.000Z	missille		hi, new to ubuntu. Have a problem, I installed it on a usb 2.0 stick. But it only runs on usb 1 so its very slow
2008-10-28T14:41:00.000Z	missille		does anybody know an command line or anything to fix the problem
2008-10-28T14:41:00.000Z	Gnea	missille	obtain a system with usb 2.0 ports
2008-10-28T14:42:00.000Z	Gnea	missille	then it shouldn't be running at 1.1 speeds.
