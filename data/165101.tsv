2006-12-24T08:49:00.000Z	daviey		Hi, does anybody know of a 3-way videoconferencing (full-screen) software that is compatible with windows?  It also needs to be easily installed, with no firewall forwarding for the windows users.
2006-12-24T08:24:00.000Z	daviey		Can anybody recommend a Video Chat / conference that will support 3 way video/audio calling that has a windows client.  Ideally good quality and fullscreen?
