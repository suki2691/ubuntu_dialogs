Not getting any info on GTK... how about this - on the GIMP website, it says that to obtain the latest version of GIMP, I merely need to run apt-get install gimp, yet, when I do this, all I get is GIMP 2.2.13, the one that comes with Feisty.  Is there any way for me to correct this other than compiling and installing GIMP manually (which I seem to be having considerable difficulty with)
