2008-10-28T17:46:00.000Z	cloud-ieee		I did this command: apt-get install gnome-core, and I am still in text mode. Someone please help me get into gui mode?? :(
2008-10-28T17:47:00.000Z	LjL	cloud-ieee	gnome-core doesn't install X. why don't you just install "ubuntu-desktop"?
2008-10-28T17:47:00.000Z	cloud-ieee	LjL	okay I will try that. :)
2008-10-28T17:49:00.000Z	cloud-ieee	LjL	ran: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop in terminal. Installing now. Thx!
