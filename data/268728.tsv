2005-09-23T10:15:00.000Z	NoX_Hand		Hello! Is there anyone who has the time or will to guide me through the process of installing wine and getting Steam up and runnning on it? I have ALL files downloaded but do not know how to use them properly. Have spent hours trying.

2005-09-23T10:16:00.000Z	bob2	NoX_Hand	did you go and find out if wine really runs steam at all?
