2010-04-16T06:42:00.000Z	Uboss		My Ubuntu 9.10 have some problems which happens once in 2-3 days. There is anyway to fix errors or lost packages on Ubuntu ?
2010-04-16T06:43:00.000Z	Losha	Uboss	Your statement sounds very strange: normally running systems don't 'lose' packages.
2010-04-16T06:44:00.000Z	Uboss	Losha	I did a restart and I was looking only thumb and no cursor or start menu.
