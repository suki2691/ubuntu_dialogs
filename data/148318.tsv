2007-05-29T13:18:00.000Z	voicu		and do usb devices get an uuid?
2007-05-29T13:19:00.000Z	Tom47	voicu	i started with apropos uuid, that gave me 4 possibilities,  i think the one you want is vol_id so type man vol_id and see what you need
2007-05-29T13:21:00.000Z	voicu	Tom47	well, i need something like a listing of the current drives with their corresponding uuids
