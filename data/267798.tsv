2005-06-29T08:32:00.000Z	teethdood		I'm new to Ubuntu, just curious about when the next Ubuntu release would come out now that  Sarge is out
2005-06-29T08:34:00.000Z	teethdood		is there a umm..."nightly" of the Ubuntu's Sarge version?
2005-06-29T08:34:00.000Z	crimsun	teethdood	no, but there's the "sid" equivalent called "breezy"
2007-05-02T12:00:00.000Z	crimsun	teethdood	for many, yes.
