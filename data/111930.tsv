2011-05-12T02:32:00.000Z	MatthiasHamburg1		Hi, I installed 11.4 on my Asus eeepc (very small netbook).
2011-05-12T02:32:00.000Z	MatthiasHamburg1		Now I got strange font problems. Sometimes some characters of some fonts are screwed. After every boot a different font and different characters are affected. For example: After one boot all "L" characters in LibreOffice standard font are screwed up, but only in font size 10. After a boot it may be a different character, font and/or different font size, for example small "e" of font size 9.
