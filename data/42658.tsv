2010-12-14T20:28:00.000Z	Jemt		Hello. I want to automate the Ubuntu installation by using preseeds. How can I identify the names of the questions asked in d-i (the Debian/Ubuntu installer) ? The Wiki describes many of them, but I'm not sure they are all there.
2010-12-14T20:29:00.000Z	Jemt		Perhaps it's possible to have Ubuntu write each "label" to the console while installing, to figure out what's going on ?
