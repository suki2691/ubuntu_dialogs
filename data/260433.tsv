2009-05-10T14:31:00.000Z	Severian	Turnni	is it a USB keyboard?
2009-05-10T14:37:00.000Z	Severian	Turnni	That is eith a PS2 or AT keyboard, then.  The small one is PS2 and that is most likely.  I have seen a problem on some motherboards with USB keyboards, and I thought I might have been able to help if it had been that.  Sorry, I don't have a suggestion for you.
