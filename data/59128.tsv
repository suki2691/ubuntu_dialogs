2009-09-30T02:38:00.000Z	TheSteve0		the keyserver (keyserver.ubuntu.com) is timing out for me - can anyone else get it?
2009-09-30T02:39:00.000Z	VCoolio	TheSteve0	this one works: pool.sks-keyservers.net
2009-09-30T02:39:00.000Z	TheSteve0	VCoolio	where is that one and how do I know I can trust it for PPA packages
2009-09-30T02:40:00.000Z	VCoolio	TheSteve0	I got it in this same channel; just use the command "sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys <key-id>" where key-id is the part behind the slash
