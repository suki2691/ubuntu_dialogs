2010-06-02T17:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xSodia	 totally depends on what is in the files. those are just 'archives' they could be anything
2010-06-02T17:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xSodia	 a .gz is an archive.
2010-06-02T17:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xSodia	 or a compressed file. So what IS it eactly you are trying to install?
