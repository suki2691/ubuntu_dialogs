2011-01-15T09:59:00.000Z	aLemmer		Hey, I'm using Gnome with Window Selector. Sometimes it doesn't display all of the windows. Anyone know what this is about?
2011-01-15T10:01:00.000Z	el_seano	aLemmer	I've had this issue now and again.  I think it's Compiz occasionally arguing with Metacity.  You can explicitly set some options in gconf-editor
2011-01-15T10:01:00.000Z	aLemmer	el_seano	Could you elaborate on what that might be, or should I just go digging around?
2011-01-15T10:02:00.000Z	el_seano	aLemmer	Honestly, I don't really know the specifics.  I just fiddled around with it trying different settings and eventually got it to work.
