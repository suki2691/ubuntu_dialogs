2005-11-07T15:58:00.000Z	dooglus		aah, well I just downloaded mirc using IE in win4lin, then installed and ran it using win4lin
2005-11-07T15:59:00.000Z	dooglus		then I tried "wine mirc.exe" and it works - and what's more it remembered the settings I told it in win4lin
2005-11-07T16:00:00.000Z	dooglus		I typed "/quit" - it says here that the client quit, but the wine window didn't close.
