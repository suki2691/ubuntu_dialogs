2009-06-07T22:32:00.000Z	Accidus	mdg	How can I find out what sound card I have?
2009-06-07T22:33:00.000Z	mdg	Accidus	in a terminal type "lspci"
2009-06-07T22:34:00.000Z	mdg	Accidus	I've read the ICH9 family causes problems
2009-06-07T22:41:00.000Z	Accidus	mdg	Hmm... It's not the same case. I can use my sound system --- if I choose HDA OSS from System/preferences/sounds. But choosing the pulseaudio server produce static, as well as applications that want to use pulseaudio (like xine)
