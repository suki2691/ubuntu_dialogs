2005-10-21T15:35:00.000Z	kitty_		how i fix?
2005-10-21T15:36:00.000Z	tristanmike	kitty_	there are no backports for breezy as of yet, iirc
2005-10-21T15:39:00.000Z	tristanmike	kitty_	apparently backports wont open until the development for dapper starts, since Breezy is new, everything is pretty much already the newest
