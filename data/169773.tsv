2006-09-15T16:13:00.000Z	onthost		I have a question, i tried to compile Unreal IRCD and got this error: configure:1733: error: C compiler cannot create executables
2006-09-15T16:13:00.000Z	onthost		any ideas? gcc is installed
2006-09-15T16:14:00.000Z	ladydoor	onthost	was this on the make install phase or on the make phase?
2006-09-15T16:15:00.000Z	onthost	ladydoor	./configure phase, so the start of the make phase
