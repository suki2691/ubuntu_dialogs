2010-03-28T12:59:00.000Z	shinjitestroch		Ok this is a silly question. I am running on the eee 1000 HD and I unwittingly chose to upgrade then partial upgraded for the beta. Now I have a screen saying something about the plymoth splash screen error codes and then sends me to essentially xserver waiting for a log in. Now though through a number of commands. It looks to be running in the Terminal with color, Any ideas?
