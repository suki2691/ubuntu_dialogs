2006-10-22T11:27:00.000Z	junky		if ive 2 sounds cards, how can i change which card will be used, without having to reboot? cause now, ive to run alsaconf, then to reboot, id like to avoid that step.

2006-10-22T11:31:00.000Z	Warbo	junky	Where did you get alsaconf from? I didn't think that was included anymore
2006-10-22T11:34:00.000Z	junky	Warbo	how can i force the reload of /etc/modprobe.d/sound exactly? alsaconf restart isnt doing that?
