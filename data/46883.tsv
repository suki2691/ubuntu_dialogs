2010-10-21T06:32:00.000Z	tomgra		Does anyone know where I can get help with this error? t I replaced the 80 GB drive with a Seagate Barracuda 1TB SATA drive, 7200 RPM and 32 MB Cache. Now I cannot install anything on the new drive. I install Ubuntu 10.04 and I get to the point of where it partitions the drive. All I am doing on this part is selecting erase and use entire drive. It then goes to the next screen and sticks at 5% complete. Then I get the following error "(
2010-10-21T06:32:00.000Z	tomgra		Process:301): GLib-WARNING **: getpwuid_r(): failed due to unknown users id (0)".
