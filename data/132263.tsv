2010-06-13T04:50:00.000Z	meroekush		howdy folks.  I'm here -> http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download and see 64-bit - Not recommended for daily desktop usage  What's the deal there?
2010-06-13T04:51:00.000Z	meroekush		I have a quad core 64bit with 16gb of ram.  Why would I not want to run 64bit?
2010-06-13T04:51:00.000Z	meroekush		Should I even care?  I've used LInux for years..just not ubuntu
2010-06-13T04:52:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	meroekush	i use 64bit and have for 6+months now.. not sure why they state that.. possibly since 64bit flash is sketchy for most
