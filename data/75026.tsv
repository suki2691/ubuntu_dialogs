2008-12-01T08:00:00.000Z	mike18		i'm a linux noob and i hope this is an easy solution, but I'm trying to get my 8gb SD card to read using a USB sd read/writer and it will not work... It does however recognize a 2gb SD Card I have
2008-12-01T08:01:00.000Z	mike18		is there a size limit for SD cards in Ubuntu?
2008-12-01T08:01:00.000Z	mike18		it works in windows vista, now windows xp
