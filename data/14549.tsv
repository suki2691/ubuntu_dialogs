2012-01-02T02:07:00.000Z	tim167		hello, how can I _detect_ my keyobard layout after installing ubuntu? (i selected wrong one during installation, and I don't know which one it should be) thanks!
2012-01-02T02:09:00.000Z	tim167		i would like to be able to choose keyboard layout by typing some keys, like the ubuntu install procedure offers, but how do I do that after installation ?

2012-01-02T02:10:00.000Z	tim167	DrPenguin	yes I looked at that, but it doesn't allow me to detect the keyboard, only select from a list, and I don't know which one to take
