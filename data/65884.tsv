2009-02-18T17:18:00.000Z	giaco_		how can I synchronize a local directory  and a remote ftp folder? (without ssh)
2009-02-18T17:20:00.000Z	ikonia	giaco_	would something like rsync work ?
2009-02-18T17:21:00.000Z	giaco_	ikonia	as far as I've read rsync handles local to ssh or local to rsync synchronization, and I have just ftp
2009-02-18T17:22:00.000Z	ikonia	giaco_	cron job then
