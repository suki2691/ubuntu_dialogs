2006-10-27T06:59:00.000Z	seamus7		upgrading from 6.06 to 6.10... should I expect a clean upgrade generally ... or do most people do clean installations? I have my root in its own partition.
2006-10-27T07:00:00.000Z	dooglus	seamus7	I've upgraded from hoary->breezy->dapper->edgy without (many) problems
2006-10-27T07:01:00.000Z	dooglus	seamus7	it also depends on your experience level I guess - ie. what counts as 'a problem' for you...
2006-10-27T07:02:00.000Z	seamus7	dooglus	that's very true ... I have no problem reconfiguring things .. I just hope I don't fun into high level problems that are beyond me :)
