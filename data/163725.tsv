2007-05-03T14:38:00.000Z	samushka		how can i remove GAIM without removing the rest of the stuff associated with it? (im guessing this is done via command line)
2007-05-03T14:39:00.000Z	strabes	samushka	you mean the configuration files?
2007-05-03T14:39:00.000Z	samushka	strabes	no i mean, when i select GAIM for removal in synapics it also wants to remove Ubuntu-Desktop (which i dont want to remove)
2007-05-03T14:39:00.000Z	strabes	samushka	that's because in ubuntu, gaim is a part of the ubuntu-desktop package. I don't really know since I use KDE
