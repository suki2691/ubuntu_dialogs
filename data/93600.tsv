2008-04-25T05:17:00.000Z	fsufitch		could anybody help me get a multimonitor setup working in kde 3.5 to work along with compiz?
2008-04-25T05:18:00.000Z	tony403	fsufitch	have you tried #xorg?
2008-04-25T05:19:00.000Z	fsufitch	tony403	i thought it would be something ubuntu-specific
2008-04-25T05:19:00.000Z	tony403	fsufitch	no, ubuntu doesn't natively use kde. you could try #kubuntu as well but maybe someone here knows also
