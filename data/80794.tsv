2009-08-27T22:18:00.000Z	_nano_		Hi all, I have this extremely weird issue. Firefox and synaptic package manager are not able to connect. Firefox shows "waiting for ..." for eternity. However wget and xchat(right now connected using this) are working fine. Could any one please give me some pointers as to how to debug this issue?
