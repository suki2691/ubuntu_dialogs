2007-12-04T05:56:00.000Z	blah569		I've used Ubuntu countless of times, but I've never installed it.  I would partion my hard drive, but it would seem like a hassle to have to pick which OS to boot into.  Can anyone give me a site that has convincing reasons to use Ubuntu?  By the way, I have read all through http://www.whylinuxisbetter.net
