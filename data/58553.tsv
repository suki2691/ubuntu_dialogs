2009-06-15T18:50:00.000Z	Andy80	Darael	I'm "Administrator" while user is "Desktop User"... is it right anyway?
2009-06-15T18:51:00.000Z	Darael	Andy80	I think so - basically, "user" is not a member of the group with the same name as your user, so his read ability on your home is governed by the "other" permissions, regardless of the priveleges set in the "users and groups" widow
2009-06-15T18:52:00.000Z	Andy80	Darael	ok, thanks :) I try now!
