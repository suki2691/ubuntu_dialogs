2008-01-21T23:14:00.000Z	Pici	theunixgeek	Have you tried asking in #users.openoffice.org ?
2008-01-21T23:14:00.000Z	theunixgeek	Pici	no, I didn't know that channel existed. I'll check it out. ;)
2008-01-21T23:15:00.000Z	theunixgeek	Pici	actually, I have been there, but I joined it as #openoffice.org instead of #users.openoffice.org
