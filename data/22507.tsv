2011-01-19T00:37:00.000Z	red		Hey, I seem to have lost a full folder of files by attempting to ctrl-x -> ctrl-v it to another location and getting a prompt about error for no permissions about one of the subfolders
2011-01-19T00:38:00.000Z	red		i think I pressed skip all and the end result was the folder disappearing completely
2011-01-19T00:38:00.000Z	red		anyone know if its lost indefinately or if i can somehow recover?
