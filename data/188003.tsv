2006-05-25T13:11:00.000Z	eumario	varsendagger	killapop: Couple of things.  I'm currently running Ubuntu on 2 computers, 2.7 GHz, and a 400 MHz.  Both are running fine, except for two seperate problems.  The 2.7 GHz freezes on hotplug, which I chmod 0666 /etc/init.d/hotplug to make it boot up, which works fine, except now I have to manually modprobe snd_intel8x0 in order to get sound to work.
