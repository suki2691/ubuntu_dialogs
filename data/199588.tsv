2006-03-17T09:39:00.000Z	maihem		I've just tried to test accessibility support in Dapper, and after enabling it then logging out and in again, my gnome desktop won't start. nor will a failsafe gnome - or any gnome programs from under enlightenment.
2006-03-17T09:39:00.000Z	maihem		Does anybody know how to disable accessibility from the commandline?
