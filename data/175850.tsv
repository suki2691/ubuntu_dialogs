2010-06-09T06:02:00.000Z	M4rotku		hey guys.  i'm installing ubuntu and gentoo alongside one another.  would it be a good idea to share a home directory between the two of them?  if my user name is the same on both, will they use the same config files?  and which system should I let handle the grub configuration?  thank you for any answers/help
2010-06-09T06:04:00.000Z	M4rotku		carl-m, is that an intuitive/easy thing to set.  will i be able to figure it out easily enough when installing.  if i remember correctly, then they should be the same by default since it's the first user on each system, right?
