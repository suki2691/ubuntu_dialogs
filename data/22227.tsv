2010-12-22T22:01:00.000Z	prower		hello :> i'm trying to use the netbook edition of ubuntu on an acer aspire one (the original 8.9" model)...recording audio from it (i.e. in things like skype or amsn video conferencing) the audio recorded from the built-in microphone is extremely choppy and distorted :< is there  any way i might be able to fix it?
