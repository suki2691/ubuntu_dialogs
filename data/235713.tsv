If you have not logged out yourself, this could mean that there is some installation problem or that you may be out of disk space. Try logging in with one of the failsafe sessions to see if you can fix this problem"
2007-02-24T10:31:00.000Z	Madpilot	long_duck_dong	that sounds like an error in the CD. Did you run the "test this CD" option from the first menu it shows you?
2007-02-24T10:32:00.000Z	Madpilot	long_duck_dong	did you run an md5sum on the ISO you downloaded?
2007-02-24T10:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	long_duck_dong	if you saw a login screen on the LiveCD, you went past the very first menu. Right after the LiveCD starts up, there's a menu with about 5 options, top is "Run/Install Ubuntu", a few down is "check this CD"
