2011-05-10T03:15:00.000Z	zenner		i got a new sex toy, and it says it's "ubuntu powered", is this where I'd come for support?
2011-05-10T03:16:00.000Z	zenner		I stick the "ubuntu buttplug" up my rectum, and it's supposed to plug into a computer, and simulated thrusting of a gay man's penis
2011-05-10T03:16:00.000Z	zenner		can anyone here help me with it?
2011-05-10T03:17:00.000Z	jrib	zenner	this channel is for actual ubuntu support.  If you don't have a real question, then please be quiet.  No more warnings
