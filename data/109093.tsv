2007-12-21T22:24:00.000Z	kaddict		I'd like to know how to launch an app onto desktop #2 on startup (or with command) please if anyone knows. thanks alot
2007-12-21T22:25:00.000Z	qcode	kaddict	try app --display 0:2  or something like that
2007-12-21T22:29:00.000Z	kaddict	qcode	not working, no display there. I'm using compiz so xgl is on 0:1 and normal 0:0 if I remember well, but I'd like to start an application on the second *virtual* desktop.
