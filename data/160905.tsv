2008-07-12T06:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	solexious_	Yes, just create an empty file named ( I think ) "forcefsck"  then reboot, let me check that file name though
2008-07-12T06:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	solexious_	Yup, that's the correct name so "sudo touch /forcefsck && sudo reboot" ( the second part will not ask you before rebooting so either be ready to reboot or leave it out and reboot on your own )
