2007-06-25T06:31:00.000Z	SeveredCross		There's ntfsfix Martinp23.
2007-06-25T06:33:00.000Z	Martinp23	SeveredCross	Thanks :)
2007-06-25T06:48:00.000Z	Martinp23	SeveredCross	No - ntfsresize and gparted are still complaining that I need to boot into windows twice :(
2007-06-25T06:51:00.000Z	Martinp23	SeveredCross	It looks like ntfscheck is trying to fix only some errors, and then demanding a full check on restart (which looks like the only way I'll be able to get around this error :\).  Thanks anyway
