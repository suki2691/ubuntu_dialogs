2007-07-29T11:27:00.000Z	nohaycubetto		i got something weird happening: a dd command was running and using 13% cpu, then i killed it and klogd went crazy, 99%
2007-07-29T11:27:00.000Z	nohaycubetto		it seems they are all system logs
2007-07-29T11:28:00.000Z	poningru	nohaycubetto	why'd you kill it?
2007-07-29T11:29:00.000Z	nohaycubetto	poningru	cause it was using resources and apache started slowing down
