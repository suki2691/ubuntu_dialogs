2008-03-26T10:21:00.000Z	brent113	bluebanana	Did you accidentally delete something permanently, aka not in the trash?
2008-03-26T10:22:00.000Z	bluebanana	brent113	kinda hard to explain.... i was working on a spreadsheet in google_docs. i exported to ODS. Firefox opened the file. I was working on that ODS file in OO Calc (offline... on my comp). I clicked save in OO calc. I closed Fx. I closed OO calc. I went back to OO calc. Recent documents | tmp/myfile.ods shows error "cannot find file".
