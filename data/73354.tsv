2008-11-27T14:52:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	hmw_pidgin	No I did not, I did however start to use compiz-fusion again, but compiz-benchmark says I have 184 fps, so that shouldn't be a problem in the performance part
2008-11-27T14:53:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	hmw_pidgin	well when I'm surfing the web, I switch between tabs regualary but now when I click on an other tab, it just doesnt switch untill I click a second time
