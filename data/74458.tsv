2009-12-29T19:53:00.000Z	es-web		How do i fix, apt-get? apt-get thinks all my packede are uptodate, but i can see that version numbers dont match? is there a way to update/reinstall all packaged?
2009-12-29T19:53:00.000Z	squisher	es-web	where do you see the missmatch?
2009-12-29T19:56:00.000Z	es-web	squisher	im on a debian system, but no luck in that channel. I know that the kernal im running is 2.6.18 and the one in repo is 2.6.26, but it wont show up when i do apt-get update apt-get uprade. And i know for a fact that most packaged is affected too
2009-12-29T19:57:00.000Z	squisher	es-web	join me in #debian, that's a bit offtopic here
