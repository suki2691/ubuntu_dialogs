2008-02-08T03:35:00.000Z	|unjustice|		my friend is running ubuntu gutsy on x86, and he tried to fix his Radeon 950 card by installing f-glrx (graphics driver) and now his computer screen is completely white upon booting
2008-02-08T03:35:00.000Z	|unjustice|		is there a way for him to access his GUI? So that he can fix it?
2008-02-08T03:35:00.000Z	|unjustice|		that way I am not the intermediary
