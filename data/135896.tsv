2009-11-02T13:47:00.000Z	nine_		Hi! I got a question regarding the new login-screen in karmic koala, it looks really nice, but for some reaseon the gtk-theme stoped working. I did a "sudo -u gdm dbus-launch gnome-appearance-properties" and i says that the login-screen won't look right because I don't have gtk-theme "HumanLogin" installed. What's happened? How can I get it?
