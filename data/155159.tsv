2007-05-12T05:19:00.000Z	GuyFromHell		Can someone help me figure out why one version of firefox (64-bit) properly uses the middle click as non-paste while the other version i have (32-bit) does not?
2007-05-12T05:20:00.000Z	GuyFromHell		no one listen to the crazy man (me) ranting in the corner, thank you very much
2007-05-12T05:21:00.000Z	adaptr	GuyFromHell	perhaps their.. options are set differently ?
2007-05-12T05:21:00.000Z	GuyFromHell	adaptr	meh, that's what i thought but the about:config pages showed the same thing. it was confusing but i got it
