2006-04-12T07:20:00.000Z	pike	jkernsjr	i use it on my windows box and went to config chose custom desktop and xfce4-session to start
2006-04-12T07:23:00.000Z	jkernsjr	pike	I think my issue was that I didnt understand how xfce works...I thought it would magically remember settings I made on the dock without me exiting and choosing to save settings
