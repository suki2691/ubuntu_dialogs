2008-11-20T04:13:00.000Z	n8tuser		ldiamond-> whoever suggested vncviewer  seems to do exact same thing as you just described

2008-11-20T04:15:00.000Z	wwpiexec	n8tuser	synergy is a virtual KVM or KVM over IP.. if you have two monitors.. then you'll switch one monitor to be a clone when running VNC... and VNC doesnt transport things properly if you want to do games in one monitor and surf internet in another..
