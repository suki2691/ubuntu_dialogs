2007-12-26T20:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	acidicchip	xchat or xchat-gnome.. both are quite similar
2007-12-26T20:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	acidicchip	well, maybe run mirc in wine... i don't know.
2007-12-26T20:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	acidicchip	everyone says yes, but i don't see a big difference, i like xchat-gnome better than xchat
