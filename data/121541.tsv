2008-01-10T16:54:00.000Z	Riddell	Shapeshifter	/usr/share/icons/crystalsvg
2008-01-10T16:55:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	Riddell	Thanks!
2008-01-10T16:57:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	Riddell	I'm using somekind of a tango package for everything (so I'm not using crytal) any idea where that could be? (it's not /usr/share/icons/tango or similar)
