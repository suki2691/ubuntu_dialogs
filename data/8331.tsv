2011-10-29T12:01:00.000Z	s0nee	wildc4rd	what do you mean by "proper" gnome ?
2011-10-29T12:03:00.000Z	s0nee	wildc4rd	then its gnome2. log out then click the "gear" icon, select gnome classic, then log back in
2011-10-29T12:03:00.000Z	s0nee	wildc4rd	also gnome2 ("proper") is not supported anymore i believe. so get used to gnome3
