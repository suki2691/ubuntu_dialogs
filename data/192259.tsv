2007-05-06T12:47:00.000Z	Ernz		I have a unusual request, a couple of weeks ago at college I spotted a piece of software that runs on linux/mac/windows. It's a web developing environment that will highlight syntax errors, allow managing of a site's documents into a project and will complete java class methods into a drop down box. Can anyone suggest what I am thinking of? It begins with an 'A' and it has a big website with video demo's and stuff
