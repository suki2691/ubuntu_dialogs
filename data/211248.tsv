2006-03-16T16:29:00.000Z	Psykus		is there anyway to get ut2004 sound working at the same time as other apps using sound? i followed the guide here, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingSoundProblems?highlight=%28sound%29 , under "sound mixing", and now other apps can simultanously use sound, but not ut2004...in the settings for ut2004, it says it uses "OpenAL" for sound
2006-03-16T16:29:00.000Z	Psykus		ut2004 says "open /dev/[sound/] dsp: Device or resource busy" when I launch it when something else is playing sound
2006-03-16T16:30:00.000Z	Chousuke	Psykus	that's normal
2006-03-16T16:32:00.000Z	Psykus	Chousuke	so there's no way to play ut2004 with audio, with something else using audio at the same time?
