2010-07-03T12:54:00.000Z	delete_w		i am using ubuntu 10.04. from live cd conky and "system monitor" shows that i am not using swap space(ok for that). but when i install it on hdd conky and "system monitor" shows that i am using 1 gb swap space. but i am sure that i have not make a swap space on installation. i re-installed ubuntu again but the problem not solved. my hardware is good : i have 2gb ddr2 ram, intel with 4 cpu. normally i have never use up on 1 gb ram. so why ubuntu uses swap spa
2010-07-03T12:54:00.000Z	hiexpo	delete_w	you need swap
2010-07-03T12:55:00.000Z	delete_w	hiexpo	no i dont need.
2010-07-03T12:55:00.000Z	delete_w	hiexpo	i normally always have at least 1 gb free on my ram.
