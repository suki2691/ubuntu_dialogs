2006-11-12T17:52:00.000Z	lobo_nz		I just installed edgy, and need the kernel-headers but there is no package that matched the kernel, uname -r gives 2.6.15-27-386 but only 2.4.* kernel headers are available any ideas where they are or why they arent there?
2006-11-12T17:53:00.000Z	xen	lobo_nz	try linux-source
2006-11-12T17:53:00.000Z	xen	lobo_nz	err, and linux-headers
2006-11-12T17:53:00.000Z	xen	lobo_nz	(probably the latter, for headers...)
