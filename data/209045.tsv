2006-07-01T06:21:00.000Z	andi5	anosa	are they muted?
2006-07-01T06:22:00.000Z	andi5	anosa	so what does "does not work" mean? it contains exactly as many information as if you said... it fails ;-)
2006-07-01T06:24:00.000Z	andi5	anosa	well, one application will only play to once specified sound card by default, i guess
