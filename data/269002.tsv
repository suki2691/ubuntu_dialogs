2004-09-28T09:56:00.000Z	Keybuk	ish	make-kpkg --initrd
2004-10-09T10:56:00.000Z	Keybuk	ish	which key are you changing ?!
2004-10-09T11:03:00.000Z	Keybuk	ish	normally the window manager you wish to replace it with will have some kind of "--replace" option or similar to replace the running window manager
