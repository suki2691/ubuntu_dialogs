2012-06-27T17:33:00.000Z	cornell		Good morning all... looking for a new laptop.  Which, of course, must be ubuntu compatible, powerful and cheap ;-)
2012-06-27T17:34:00.000Z	cornell		Found one on tigerdirect, and I was looking for a site that lists compatible laptops.  Couldn't find one.  My google skills don't seem to be as good as others.  Any suggestions on a good site?
