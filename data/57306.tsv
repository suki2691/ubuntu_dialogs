2009-12-30T09:20:00.000Z	w3asal		it's not the data I want to get rid of, it's the partition. partition managers don't see it, but it mounts
2009-12-30T09:21:00.000Z	h00k	w3asal	if it's a new one, no,because it's on a physical chip
2009-12-30T09:21:00.000Z	w3asal	h00k	that's what I was afraid of, any way to tell ubuntu not to mount it?
