2007-05-23T12:28:00.000Z	Crane		I have a question, would I get better Vid card performance from nvidia by installing the binary drivers from their site?

2007-05-23T12:32:00.000Z	defrysk	Crane	missing in menu however is nvidia-settings, you might wish to add it
2007-05-23T12:34:00.000Z	Crane	defrysk	Thanks, I may look into that. I'm getting some lines (distortion) on some screens I am trying to straighten out.
