2007-12-24T07:25:00.000Z	burnte		Ok, here's a question. I have a box running U 7.04 server. sda1 is EXT3, plenty of free space (38GB disk, 23GB used), and it's got a directory that's being served via samba, so I don't want to reformat. I'm trying up upgrade to 7.10 desktop so I have another linux desktop I can hook to when needed, but the installer insists on formatting sda1. Help?

2007-12-24T07:29:00.000Z	HardDisk	burnte	can't you sudo apt-get dist-upgrade?
