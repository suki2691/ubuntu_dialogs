2007-03-03T17:44:00.000Z	tp241303		my machine will randomly hard lock when running ubuntu this can occur at anytime and i can not seem to diagnose what is causing it i think it might be something with my graphics card (nvidia) not wanting to get along with my mother board which has ati chipset on the north ans south bridge
