2006-06-26T09:11:00.000Z	_Roman		Hello, how can I stop ubuntu from restarting X when I press Shift-Ctrl-Backspace?
2006-06-26T09:12:00.000Z	Ng	_Roman	are you using Xgl?
2006-06-26T09:13:00.000Z	_Roman	Ng	yeah
2006-06-26T09:13:00.000Z	Ng	_Roman	I don't know the solution, but I've seen it mentioned and it involved xmodmap. Sorry that's not terribly helpful, but perhaps googling for xgl xmodmap will turn something up
