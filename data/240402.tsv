2008-07-11T08:51:00.000Z	nickrud	cuervo	try running   vimtutor , it'll teach the basics, and you can install vim-doc to get them all
2008-07-11T08:52:00.000Z	nickrud	cuervo	what do you mean, not there?
2008-07-11T08:53:00.000Z	nickrud	cuervo	try vim.org , but if you search synaptic for vim-doc , install it. Then the docs will be at /usr/share/doc/vim-doc
