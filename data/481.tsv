2012-11-06T04:53:00.000Z	timoK		I have screen tearing with intel hd 3000 graphics (sandy bridge). in this bugreport https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37686#c92 there is the suggestion to set 'Option "TearFree" "true"'. where do I set it? xorg.conf? I don't seem to have a xorg.conf. what now?
