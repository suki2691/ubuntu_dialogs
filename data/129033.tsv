2007-09-22T07:24:00.000Z	apecat		i'm building a new machine for myself next week, and about nvidias proprietary drivers, do they support the 8600 series well yet?
2007-09-22T07:25:00.000Z	MeRodent	apecat	the proprietary drivers do but the included drivers don't support 3d
2007-09-22T07:26:00.000Z	MeRodent	apecat	let me clarify that. restricted drivers won't support 3d but the 100.14.11 drivers do.
2007-09-22T07:26:00.000Z	apecat	MeRodent	hmm, so you mean that the latest drivers from nvidia do work. i tend to build those with envy anyway
