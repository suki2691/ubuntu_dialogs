2008-02-08T13:09:00.000Z	|katana|		hi.. I want to create a server with 2 HD in raid 1. I got a question though building up my motherboard: There's 4 sata connectors on the MB close to each other
2008-02-08T13:09:00.000Z	|katana|		and another one close to the pci-express, which reads "sata-raid"
2008-02-08T13:10:00.000Z	|katana|		the manual says if I want to install raid 0/1/JBOD, i'd need to connect a sata-disk to this one and another one to the 'external' SATA port..
