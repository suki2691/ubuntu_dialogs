2007-06-27T11:55:00.000Z	antknight		I have an observation I'd like to share.  ubuntu has no 3d effects like, emblems or characters in the system itself.
2007-06-27T11:55:00.000Z	antknight		like for splash screens, etc
2007-06-27T11:56:00.000Z	antknight		if wobbly windows are possible, there should be 3d effects
2007-06-27T11:56:00.000Z	paganjew	antknight	why should it, 3d effect requires certain hardware that certain ubuntoors may not have
