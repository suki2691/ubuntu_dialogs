2010-05-01T13:37:00.000Z	maco	M0DCM_Dave	both
2010-05-01T13:38:00.000Z	maco	M0DCM_Dave	the answer is *sigh*
2010-05-01T13:39:00.000Z	maco	M0DCM_Dave	there is a way to make it work in 9.10 i havent tried it with 10.04, but there's a wiki page explaining how to do it and an ubuntu developer trying to push it along a bit since intel abandoned it
