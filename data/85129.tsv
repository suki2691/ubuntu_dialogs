2008-07-19T07:17:00.000Z	Guest101		Today, I have attempted to install Ubuntu 8.04 Desktop editon. I have burnt the disc myself, and I have checked, it has no errors. It all goes fine until the partitioning part . Here, I choose the the option where you can drag along the amount of space you want. I allow Ubunto 12gb (i have 100gb free). I press next and it says 0% for about 30 secs. and then a little box comes titiled...
2008-07-19T07:17:00.000Z	Guest101		..."Re-size operation failure", witht he message, "An error has occured while writing changes to the storage devices. The re-size has been aborted.". From then it only gives me the other two options of using all the space available and manual...  I dont know what to do in manual and I want to dual boot.. Please help, and I know it is not the disc.
