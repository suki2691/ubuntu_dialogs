Can anyone who's got experience with recovering files with foremost tell what's wrong with this command:' sudo foremost -v -t mp3 -i /dev/sda1 ' because it doesn't start recovering but gives me the synopsis text with the options etc like I would have written an invalid command...
2009-01-18T23:29:00.000Z	tommi		I'm trying to recover some mp3 that were on my computer before I formatted the hard disk

2009-01-18T23:32:00.000Z	tommi	LorgonJortle	Haha! Yeah, you would think so...
