2007-12-26T14:32:00.000Z	MidnightCommando	menllyos	xchat-gnome is a simplified version
2007-12-26T14:34:00.000Z	MidnightCommando	menllyos	xchat-gnome follows the gnome philosophy of "don't confuse the idiots with too many functions"
2007-12-26T14:35:00.000Z	MidnightCommando	menllyos	i'll talk to you later at some time probably, but not here
