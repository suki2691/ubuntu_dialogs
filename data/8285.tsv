2011-10-28T12:40:00.000Z	DarsVaeda		how do I move an application window to another workspace in unity 11.10?
2011-10-28T12:41:00.000Z	DarsVaeda		is there a shortcut or something?
2011-10-28T12:41:00.000Z	MeganLWoulffe	DarsVaeda	open the workspace switcher, drag window to new workspace
2011-10-28T12:52:00.000Z	MeganLWoulffe	DarsVaeda	when you do that and release, it does like in win7 to maximize that window to half the screen
