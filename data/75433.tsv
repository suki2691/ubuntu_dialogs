2011-03-06T15:28:00.000Z	mmo|		Hi, I have a problem that when transfering files from my server (an old fit-pc 1-0) the transfers are at first as fast as one would expect (about 11-12 mb/sec) but then after a while drops A LOT - down to about 1 mb/sec. I am using vsftp to transfer over a local network to another ubuntu machine connecting with gftp. Any ideas what might be wrong? soe buffer filling up or..?
