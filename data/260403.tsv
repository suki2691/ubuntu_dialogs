2004-11-01T09:10:00.000Z	Fart-Doh-Ruh		no hidden costs right ?
2004-11-01T09:10:00.000Z	TheMuso	Fart-Doh-Ruh	A large number of pressed CDs doesn't usually cost much.
2004-11-01T09:11:00.000Z	Fart-Doh-Ruh	TheMuso	interested to order quite a big number so that we can pass them around during freesoftware day next year in Malaysia
