2012-03-17T13:48:00.000Z	selite	sacarlson	Yeah, I tried it. But that way I can only access it from my computer. In other words that way it can be accessed only from machines connected to that router.
2012-03-17T13:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	selite	well my router I have access to that section disabled from the wan side as might be by default for security,  it might be able to be set active as an option
2012-03-17T13:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	selite	other option is you can forward ssh trafic to your ubuntu server inside your home net,  login to that and then ssh remote from that into your router
