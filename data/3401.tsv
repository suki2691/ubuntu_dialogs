2012-10-24T07:10:00.000Z	MestreLion		So.. no one has any info on a similarly-looking netbook-launcher for Precise 12.04 ? I really miss it
2012-10-24T07:12:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	MestreLion	I've not seen any notices on a return of it.
2012-10-24T07:14:00.000Z	MestreLion	wilee-nilee	I'm sure it won't "come back", since canonical is promoting Unity. But is there a known port of it? or an alternative? Maybe a PPA?
2012-10-24T07:14:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	MestreLion	Ubuntu has different OS in the works I believe I was just looking around I see nothing yet.
