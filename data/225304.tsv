I remember how much trouble I went through when I upgraded to Breezy last year. There were problems with bugs and the repositories. So I'm considering waiting 3-6 months before upgrading

2006-06-02T05:46:00.000Z	Jemt	kakalto	Stable, not to many bugs, all repositories are running etc.
2006-06-02T05:47:00.000Z	kakalto	Jemt	keep asking, I don't actually have dapper yet :D
