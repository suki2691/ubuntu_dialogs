2008-12-15T17:09:00.000Z	Starcraftmazter		oh, is there a more accurate way to check this?
2008-12-15T17:10:00.000Z	mchelen	Starcraftmazter	thats fine mah is a measure of storage capacity
2008-12-15T17:11:00.000Z	mchelen	Starcraftmazter	just check the voltage and amperage are the same, and it should be fine
