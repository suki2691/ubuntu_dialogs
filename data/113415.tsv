2009-11-08T02:23:00.000Z	gluonman	oliver3	that's what I expected. But I didn't receive the prompt. Maybe grub2 stopped doing that?
2009-11-08T02:24:00.000Z	oliver3	gluonman	not a clue. Just have a look at your menu.lst, see what it says. I'm not that familiar with grub2, so that's the best I can do unfortunately.
2009-11-08T02:24:00.000Z	gluonman	oliver3	alright.
