2009-01-17T06:15:00.000Z	peleg	Anacranom	there is no #evolution as far as I know, but I didn't do a long research about it. I don't know if it is ubuntu-specific: I have found in the web mostly about ubuntu, but also one complaint with fedore, something quite similar
2009-01-17T06:16:00.000Z	Anacranom	peleg	i'm doing some testing on sled11, will compare to my Ubuntu stats
2009-01-17T06:17:00.000Z	peleg	Anacranom	hey, if you find out anything, let me know :-)
