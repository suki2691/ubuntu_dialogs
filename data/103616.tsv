2010-07-15T20:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gintulis	its lighter
2010-07-15T20:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gintulis	run: df -h    see how much space is used compared to your crappy windows install
2010-07-15T20:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gintulis	remember ubuntu comes with a full office suite and burning app (and optional codecs) by default, Windows cannot play DVDs and other stuff without paying out for software'
