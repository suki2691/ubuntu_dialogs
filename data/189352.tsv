2009-10-29T18:14:00.000Z	meeeeee		Hi, I had Ubuntu Hardy and recently I've upgraded to Intrepid and then Jaunty. I was trying to install g++-3.4 in Jaunty today with hardy deb packages, so I ran dpkg -i *.deb on them (gcc-3.4 and it's dependencies) but dpkg returend some dependency errors. now running any app ends with segmentation fault! even init (kernel panic). how can I undo my changes on libc (?) ?
