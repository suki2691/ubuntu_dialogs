2009-10-26T07:22:00.000Z	Psibottu		hey guys, i'm on ubuntu 9.04. when i go to "places" and click on any of the options ranging from: "Home Folder, Desktop, Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos" if i have a dvd or some kind of media in, it loads that instead of opening the folder. and when nothing is in the drive, it doesn't open the folder at all or do anything. it's only those folders (the first column) the rest are fine.
2009-10-26T07:22:00.000Z	Psibottu		that's the question
