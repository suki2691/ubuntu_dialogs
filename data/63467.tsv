2010-05-01T07:30:00.000Z	Cthulhu		Hi there, I installed ubuntu 9.04 on my eeePC and it was working fine for the first few months but one day it stopped letting my update saying that my connection had been refused by the repositories. Does anyone have any idea why this happened?

2010-05-01T07:31:00.000Z	Cthulhu	acicula	I've picked several new mirrors. I should also add that wget isnt working and neither is transmission
2010-05-01T07:31:00.000Z	acicula	Cthulhu	ok so not the mirrors then, then its your network/your installation
