2010-04-08T21:12:00.000Z	LiteWolff		Really weird issue: I can only SSH into my home Linux box from school using browsershell.com or I get a connection refused error. This includes if I use Putty or MindTerm
2010-04-08T21:13:00.000Z	LiteWolff		I can SSH to the home linux box from anywhere else using any client, but in school only browsershell.com works
2010-04-08T21:14:00.000Z	LiteWolff		Then why does browsershell work?
2010-04-08T21:14:00.000Z	Kaabi	LiteWolff	if you able to ping ur home box from school
