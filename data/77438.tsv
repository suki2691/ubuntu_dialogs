2009-07-19T22:51:00.000Z	Halabund		I'm looking for replacement for two programs I use in Windows:  One is a viewer for DJVU files, WinDjView, which allows creating bookmarks to views of the document (and even remembers the bookmarks when the document is moved to a different location on disk).  The other is a tool that can annotate PDFs.  (Unfortunately evince doesn't even display annotated PDFs correctly).  So, any suggestions?

2009-07-19T22:52:00.000Z	Halabund	Riddell	evince does djvu as well, but what I'm missing is the bookmarking functionality.  Does okular have that?
