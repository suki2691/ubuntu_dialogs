2010-03-14T20:27:00.000Z	xangua	fleixius	install 'qt4 config' and set your qt apps preferences there
2010-03-14T20:28:00.000Z	fleixius	xangua	I'll give that a shot 1 sec
2010-03-14T20:29:00.000Z	fleixius	xangua	So the font size is 14 pt but the overall resolution of the application looks to be enormouse, as the text remains small.
