2010-08-29T19:38:00.000Z	anonymous50		hi im using 64-bit ubuntu 10.04 desktop edition, and i was wondering how to get the mouse movement to be equal to windows mouse movement settings
2010-08-29T19:38:00.000Z	coz_	anonymous50	  can you explain that  a little more in detail?
2010-08-29T19:39:00.000Z	coz_	anonymous50	 did you go into   system/preferences/mouse   to make some changes that suit you better?
2010-08-29T19:42:00.000Z	coz_	anonymous50	 mm  I  have both windows and ubuntu installed and I prefer the ubuntu "style"  for this but as I said  that diaglog should be able to match it pretty close
