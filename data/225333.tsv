2006-06-15T15:21:00.000Z	Xgates	Hobbsee	yeah j/k not to many DEVS around anywhere, unless a small distro, but Gentoo has a few that hang there
2006-06-15T15:22:00.000Z	Hobbsee	Xgates	oh, there are a couple aroudn here, and a fair few on IRC - but they're mostly coding, and bugfixing - not reading the user channel, per se...
