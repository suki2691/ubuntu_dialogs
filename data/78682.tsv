2009-04-11T18:08:00.000Z	beer1		Hello can anyone help me restore grub after vista install? I did http://paste.ubuntu.com/148873/ .. am I doing something wrong? :/
2009-04-11T18:08:00.000Z	lfaraone	beer1	and does it not work on reboot?
2009-04-11T18:12:00.000Z	lfaraone	beer1	try it the other way and see what happens.
2009-04-11T18:14:00.000Z	lfaraone	beer1	because the windows boot loader uses the boot flag for stuff
