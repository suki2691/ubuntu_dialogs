2007-04-20T09:11:00.000Z	CapaH		Maybe someone here knows how to do this, I am downloading an ISO (Ubuntu Feisty 64) --- I have downloaded 694,000 out of 792,000 -- and I *really* dont want to restart the download, is there some way I can do this? :)
2007-04-20T09:12:00.000Z	Krazytekn0	CapaH	what did you use to download before?
2007-04-20T09:12:00.000Z	CapaH	Krazytekn0	What I did, is I used firefox (DOH) to download 9/10ths of the file, and now I have a file that is 692,XXX bytes and I just need maybe another 100,000 bytes
2007-04-20T09:14:00.000Z	Krazytekn0	CapaH	unfortunately firefox doesn't support download resuming, I would suggest you install a good download manager for these types of files, sorry to break the bad news
