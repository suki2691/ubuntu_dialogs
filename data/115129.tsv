2007-10-26T08:00:00.000Z	tostig		i am running ubuntu 7.10 AMD64 edition and i've noticed an awful lot of applications claiming i386 incompatiblity.. is ubuntu x64 incapable of running most 32 bit applications (examples are google desktop and avg's anti-virus)
2007-10-26T08:01:00.000Z	tostig		i suppose i may have to download the 32 bit version and use that for maximum compatibility, but i hate to give up the 64 bit speed.. does anyone have any suggestions? is it possible to install i386 .deb packages on ubuntu x64?
2007-10-26T08:02:00.000Z	`eric-	tostig	is 64bit really that much faster?
2007-10-26T08:02:00.000Z	tostig	`eric-	i guess i am not sure?  i have only used the 64 bit version.. i read somewhere that 7.10 really showed differences between the 32 and 64 editions
