2009-08-17T08:14:00.000Z	Magliadoro		 Hello. I'm trying to run Morrowind in Wine on Ubuntu 9.04. The sound works fine by the graphics are so slow they're nearly frozen. I don't know what I'm doing with it, as this is the first time I've installed Wine and am not a regular Linux user (though I'm using it more and more lately.) I was hoping to get some help with the configuartion of Wine, perhaps, if that's where the problem is.
2009-08-17T08:14:00.000Z	Magliadoro		I have asked this question in #winehq but it's been awhile and no one has answered yet.
