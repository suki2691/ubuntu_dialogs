2007-05-27T08:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	Rode1	 you dont want to be changing partitions on mounted filesystems
2007-05-27T08:25:00.000Z	Rode1	Polygon89	i have unmounted and then tried ot change its system but i get teh same message back
2007-05-27T08:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	Rode1	 this is why i normally use a live cd and it gparted tools.
