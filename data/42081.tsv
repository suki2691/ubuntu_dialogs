2009-11-30T00:19:00.000Z	Il__Matteo	computa_mike	i need to do it notwithstanding the application from which i print
2009-11-30T00:21:00.000Z	computa_mike	Il__Matteo	I think the Collate option may be provided by the standard printing functionality
2009-11-30T00:24:00.000Z	Il__Matteo	computa_mike	sorry, i don't find any "collate" similar options in italian
