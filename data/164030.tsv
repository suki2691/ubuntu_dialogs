2007-05-26T07:58:00.000Z	schoolsetup		i seem to have an small probem, our wireless card ( rausb0 ) does work but the signal strength does not show, what could be the cause?

2007-05-26T08:01:00.000Z	bulmer	schoolsetup	do you have a line of sight? maybe you are just getting into the backlobes of the signal..there are lots of factors when it comes to radio antennae stuff
