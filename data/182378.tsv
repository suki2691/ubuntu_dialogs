2006-09-23T08:22:00.000Z	stefg	Fungyo	yes it can... by providing nonsense-dpmi info
2006-09-23T08:24:00.000Z	stefg	Fungyo	what hardware, how much RAM?
2006-09-23T08:25:00.000Z	stefg	Fungyo	Better use xubuntu and the alternate CD for this hardware... Better fun that way. Gnome is sort of heavy for that machine
