2009-03-11T18:39:00.000Z	mikerose357		Hi I've noticed directly editing xorg doesn't work like it did in older versions of fedora specifically adding the right resolution to metamodes doesn't work
2009-03-11T18:39:00.000Z	mikerose357		using nvidias gui tool doesn't list any number of valid resolutions as usable so I'm stuck with a low resolution
2009-03-11T18:41:00.000Z	mikerose357		anyone know how you are supposed to manually configure xorg in ubuntu 8.10?
2009-03-11T18:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	mikerose357	manually? you mean editting xorg.conf ?
