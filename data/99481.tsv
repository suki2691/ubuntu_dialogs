2008-02-23T06:27:00.000Z	|Prometheus|	EnvoyRising	thank you. but i think i need the script to run before anything else... Ill explain my problem. I am getting DMA timeouts on y old hdd (/dev/hda).. i have appended kernel string to use ide=nodma, but still get the timeouts.. i have also tried /etc/hdparm.conf and added /dev/hda dma=off but still get the timeout. its very frustrating as it has increased my boot tie by almost two inutes
