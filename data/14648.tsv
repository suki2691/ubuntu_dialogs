2011-05-09T09:22:00.000Z	nikhil_	quackaduck	intel GMA 4500MHD
2011-05-09T09:26:00.000Z	quackaduck	nikhil_	I don't know about intel cards, but when I use the open source drivers for my ati card, my laptop certainly runs hotter and drains my battery faster. Probably has to do something with power management on the intel drivers?
2011-05-09T09:26:00.000Z	nikhil_	quackaduck	yeah, intel fortunately releases open source only drivers
