2007-03-10T06:47:00.000Z	LordLimecat	joe4444	AFAIK, disks are generally mounted in /media/afolderyouname
2007-03-10T06:47:00.000Z	joe4444	LordLimecat	i thought that was for removeable media like CDs, DVDs, and USB keys
2007-03-10T06:48:00.000Z	LordLimecat	joe4444	i DO remember once umpon a time being told to mount stuff in /mnt, but the guides ive seen say mount in /media
