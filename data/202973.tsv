2006-03-01T13:28:00.000Z	fli7e		quick question: file location of grub.conf?
2006-03-01T13:28:00.000Z	_jason	fli7e	don't think there is one, is /boot/grub/menu.lst what you want?
2006-03-01T13:28:00.000Z	fli7e	_jason	yeah probably. just looking to extend bootloader times
2006-03-01T13:29:00.000Z	_jason	fli7e	yep, just look for the ``timeout'' line iirc
