2007-06-25T07:05:00.000Z	illusions		I am having a problem when installing Ubuntu 7.04, the X server won't start... I have a Dell Inspiron 6400/E1505 with a Radeon X1400 video card, it keeps coming up with the error that it can't find the drivers for my Broadcom wireless NIC, any ideas as to why the X server keeps giving me errors? It says that it found 'screens' but none are compatible or something along those lines..
2007-06-25T07:06:00.000Z	Pelo	illusions	 you need to use the alternate install cd,  it is text based,   after the installation is complete you can then install the drivers for your ati video card
2007-06-25T07:08:00.000Z	Pelo	illusions	 if you were using the dvd , you could select the text install but not with the cd,  you need to dl the alternate cd
2007-06-25T07:09:00.000Z	Pelo	illusions	 they are further down the page,  but for now you just need the alternate isntall cd
