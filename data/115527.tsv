2007-10-23T07:41:00.000Z	xJonnyx134		I am trying to install 7.10 - 64Bit. When attempting the install I get the standard installation menu. When slecting ANY of the options on the boot menu the linux kernel will load. After the kernel has loaded nothing happens. The screen goes black as if something is going to happen but after several minutes nothing does. Please help!
