2010-07-20T02:37:00.000Z	SuNk8	tbiddle	Adobe doesnt provide 64 bit flash for Linux. However, you can install the same using medibuntu repos or Ubuntu Tweak... Works fine on mine...
2010-07-20T02:38:00.000Z	tbiddle	SuNk8	pretty new to ubuntu so medibuntu repos and ubuntu tweak are a foreign language to me! (i'll start googling)
2010-07-20T02:40:00.000Z	SuNk8	tbiddle	search for medibuntu. It's the unofficial repositories containing extra codecs. You will find their walkthrough useful. Similarly Ubuntu Tweak is a beautiful rogram integrated with a variety of tools that makes an Ubuntu user's life easier... ;-)
