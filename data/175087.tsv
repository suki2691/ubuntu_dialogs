2008-03-24T18:36:00.000Z	eva		Hi, just upgraded my laptop from Gutsy to Hardy, and now I can't log into Gnome. Only some letters (like 5 and +) works at all when entering the username and password
2008-03-24T18:38:00.000Z	eva		Sorry, no the keylock is not on. Login works great in the non-gnome terminals
2008-03-24T18:39:00.000Z	eva		Google and the Ubuntu bug database finds me nothing
2008-03-24T18:40:00.000Z	seamus_ie	eva	i had a similar problem a while ago, turned out to be a prob with language and keyboard layout configs, maybe check those
