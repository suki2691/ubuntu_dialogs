2011-08-25T15:39:00.000Z	Aquix	ox3a	- macs can be tricky. But there is a mac section on ubuntuforums
2011-08-25T15:39:00.000Z	ox3a	Aquix	i see... Tricky is not good if Ubuntu is primary os
2011-08-25T15:40:00.000Z	Aquix	ox3a	- I only know there can be issues. If they are hard to fix or not I have no clue
