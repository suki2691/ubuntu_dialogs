2006-07-18T11:06:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	SeraVitae	I've been trying to find one that worked for me for months .. I read about them working great all the time .. but nothing so far for me .. just a nice lefty, and a gray righty ..
2006-07-18T11:06:00.000Z	SeraVitae	NineTeen67Comet	 that doesnt give me much hope of getting my quadruple display going :(
2006-07-18T11:07:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	SeraVitae	Not really .. I've got enough monitors to pull that one off, just not enough vid cards ..
