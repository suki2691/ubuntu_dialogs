2011-07-24T09:48:00.000Z	DrGrov		What would you guys and girls say is a good Twitter client? I am completely new to Twitter so I would love a quick run through of a good client. Running Ubuntu 10.04.
2011-07-24T09:48:00.000Z	aldermikov	DrGrov	the website?
2011-07-24T09:49:00.000Z	DrGrov	aldermikov	Sure, I thought of that but I would prefer a desktop client to handle my Twitter account. I would not get carried away too much when I am working LOL
