2008-01-23T08:22:00.000Z	wookienz	grekkos	it mounts ok and i can explore it.. well some of it before it locks up the entire computer...i think there maybe a physical error on it
2008-01-23T08:24:00.000Z	grekkos	wookienz	might want to get rid of it then, but I'm probably not the best person to ask about this... If there's nothing irreplaceable on it i'd reformat
