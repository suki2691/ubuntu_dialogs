2006-03-08T11:31:00.000Z	alolex		is there a driver for windows XP to access ext3 file system with write permission?
2006-03-08T11:31:00.000Z	LjL	alolex	"ext2 windows" finds at least two possibilities. not sure about write support though
2006-03-08T11:33:00.000Z	LjL	alolex	http://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2fsd this one appears to have write support, while the others appear to lack it
2006-03-08T11:33:00.000Z	LjL	alolex	if it were my filesystem, though, i wouldn't trust it
