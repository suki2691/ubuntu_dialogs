2010-04-20T17:24:00.000Z	csaba		you need to download the source code and compile xchat, then you get a really powerful irc client
2010-04-20T17:25:00.000Z	csaba		for some reason the debian packers butchered xchat and removed anything useful
2010-04-20T17:25:00.000Z	tarzeau	csaba	they forgot to remove xchat itself then
