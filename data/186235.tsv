2006-11-02T10:43:00.000Z	GaiaX11		Suppose  I am doing a dist-upgrade and the light is off. Will my system break?
2006-11-02T10:44:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	GaiaX11	if you mean the power goes out, yeah it could be a problem for sure
2006-11-02T10:46:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Kingsqueak	But, can i start from where it stopped?
2006-11-02T10:46:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	GaiaX11	not likely, I would STRONGLY recommend you don't do an upgrade with an unstable connection or power issue
