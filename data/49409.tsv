2011-07-08T15:39:00.000Z	don-i		if i send an encryped email to person A, who has the correct private key to decrypt, and they send it to person B, who also has person A's private key, can the email be decrypted ? Basically what im asking is, is the key tied directly to the email address, or is the email address just used for identification
