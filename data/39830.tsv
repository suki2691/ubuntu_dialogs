2011-03-02T00:03:00.000Z	meowsus		I'm looking for a way to back up the important parts of my system so that, in the event of hard drive failure, i can put a new hard drive in, install Ubuntu, then install my backup overtop of the Ubuntu Install and be up and running in a short amount of time.
2011-03-02T00:03:00.000Z	meowsus		Is there a program to do this, or some sort of method?
2011-03-02T00:04:00.000Z	Jkessler	meowsus	 i would guess you would want to save the list of installed packages so you could reinstall them quickly, i don't know the best way to do this though
2011-03-02T00:04:00.000Z	meowsus	Jkessler	yes, since i'd be backing up my home folder as well
