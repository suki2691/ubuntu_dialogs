2008-09-25T05:42:00.000Z	Derrike		I don't want to repeat myself but I think it got lost in a wave of join/parts.
2008-09-25T05:43:00.000Z	Derrike		Pardon, but I'm wondering about the documentation provided for installing via USB. I've been in a pit using the two methods provided. (Live CD via USB is slow, and usually freezes; alternate just doesn't work the way everyone is saying it should.)
2008-09-25T05:44:00.000Z	S3lo	Derrike	i tried Unetbootin ( http://lubi.sourceforge.net/unetbootin.html ) to create my USB installer, might help
2008-09-25T05:45:00.000Z	Derrike	S3lo	Would it use the graphical or command-line install?
