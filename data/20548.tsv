2011-03-23T07:14:00.000Z	ohsix	sphinxxx	you might have to disable the journal to mount it, or have it ignore it; not sure, but at least it's a direction to go :P
2011-03-23T07:15:00.000Z	sphinxxx	ohsix	i got it mounted and i can see the library and applications folders and some other stuff, but cannot find any documents
2011-03-23T07:15:00.000Z	ohsix	sphinxxx	couldn't say; haven't had much opportunity to look at those filesystems in that scenario
