2006-11-14T15:37:00.000Z	Keyseir_		I have a vmware related question: I'd like to configure a directory of some sort on my host OS (ubuntu linux, ext3 format) that both my guest os (XP pro) and host can manipulate. I just need this to be text files.. is this possible?
2006-11-14T15:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	Keyseir_	there are ext3 drivers for XP
2006-11-14T15:38:00.000Z	Keyseir_	Madpilot	Would it be possible to set it up so that vmware xp could only access a specific part of my real HD?
2006-11-14T15:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	Keyseir_	no idea
