2011-12-17T02:03:00.000Z	Lufti_oO		I have big problem while installing ubuntu 11.10 64bit: The install assistant is still open. Its command line says "ready if you are". The assistants current form it displays is "Keyboard layout" where you have to choose your lazout. I did that, klicked continue, everything is now grayed out (no back or continue possible) and nothing happens. I waited one hour.
2011-12-17T02:03:00.000Z	Lufti_oO		anz idea?
2011-12-17T02:04:00.000Z	abstrakt	Lufti_oO	try rebooting and do it again maybe. I had some strange issues with the ubuntu installer and I just rebooted and tried again and it was fine
