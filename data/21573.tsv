2012-10-16T00:40:00.000Z	Aerosonic		So there's a bit of a problem I need solving. So there are 354 torrents in my uTorrent client and 466 files in the Downloads folder. Is there a way to easily identify which files are not *in* the uTorrent client without going through them manually?
2012-10-16T00:40:00.000Z	michealPW	Aerosonic	Right, well you should try to goto a uTorrent support channel and not a Ubuntu support? ;)
2012-10-16T00:41:00.000Z	Aerosonic	michealPW	Well, you guys are smart. You might figure something out, I'm sure.
