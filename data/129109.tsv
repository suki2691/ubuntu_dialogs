2010-12-31T03:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	embiopterid_	 theres the fbset tools that may be able ot set the console wallpapers. (i hated that feature)
2010-12-31T03:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	embiopterid_	 theres Some reason Plymouht has issues with the Nvidia/ati drivers.. if its not using X. i cant imagine why it would be having the issues.
