2008-10-29T03:22:00.000Z	tundrayeti312		I've been messing around with Samba, and now every time i try to sudo, it says 'unable to resolve host', how do i fix this?
2008-10-29T03:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	tundrayeti312	I had this issue the other day.. go to System/Admin/Network and unlock.. then click Hosts and add 127.0.0.1 and your user name
2008-10-29T03:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	tundrayeti312	or actually add your desktop name.. my login is .. well lets say.. Scunizi but the machine is scunizi-desktop
2008-10-29T03:25:00.000Z	Scunizi	tundrayeti312	should also take effect right away
