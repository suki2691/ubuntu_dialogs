2009-01-30T05:31:00.000Z	Trenter		Question:  I recently updated my linux kernel and it removed my windows partition and my rescue drive partition.  How do I go about restoring them?

2009-01-30T05:32:00.000Z	Trenter	Nubbie	 After updating my system it asked a question about linux kernel because it was updating, I said yes and now my windows boot option is gone
