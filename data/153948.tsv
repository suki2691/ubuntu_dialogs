2006-12-20T10:46:00.000Z	insomnia		hey, I got a funny question for someone.
2006-12-20T10:47:00.000Z	insomnia		I'm just trying out ubuntu for the first time here...and it seems to have by default, not installed make or gcc.
2006-12-20T10:47:00.000Z	insomnia		is that S.O.P. ?
2006-12-20T10:47:00.000Z	superb0wl_	insomnia	i think they gear ubuntu for normal (read: less technical) people
