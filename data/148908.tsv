2008-04-08T06:05:00.000Z	budluva		im trying to compile an mkv to mp4 using a tutorial on ubuntu forums, but entering the ./configure command gives me error: zlib not found on system or in local libs
2008-04-08T06:05:00.000Z	budluva		     so i tried to install build-essential and zlibc to correct this but after apt-get installing those 2 packages i still get the same error, am i missing something here?
2008-04-08T06:06:00.000Z	unop	budluva	you might need this package .. zlib1g-dev
2008-04-08T06:07:00.000Z	unop	budluva	no
