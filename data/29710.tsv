2010-10-23T00:03:00.000Z	batok		from where gdm takes configuration?  I have killed gdm and doing sudo service gdm start but graphical mode never appears
2010-10-23T00:04:00.000Z	batok		it's virtualbox most ctrl and alt don't work
2010-10-23T00:05:00.000Z	batok		is there a way to simulate from a command ctrl alt f7?
