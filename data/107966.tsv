2008-01-12T05:22:00.000Z	ThinkingMan		Mornin boys, I'm on a new install of Gutsy and no matter what I do I can't get flash to install/work with firefox, I can install through the cute firefox prompt, looks like it works but no result, same thing through synaptic
2008-01-12T05:22:00.000Z	ThinkingMan		any ideas on why flash doesn't seem to want to work with mozilla?
2008-01-12T05:23:00.000Z	ThinkingMan		yeah, I've already been throug what ubotu says
2008-01-12T05:23:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	ThinkingMan	so you've tried to fix flash the unsupported way?
