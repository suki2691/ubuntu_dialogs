2008-05-26T03:18:00.000Z	Billenium		Or like, /usr needs around xGB to function etc...
2008-05-26T03:19:00.000Z	gwern	Billenium	not really. but the rule of thumb I've always used is '/boot needs no more than 50mb or so; /home should get about 90% of space, and put everything else in / in what's left over from swap
2008-05-26T03:20:00.000Z	gwern	Billenium	for example, on my 500gb drive, I'd partition like this: /dev/sda1 = boot = 30mb; /dev/sda2 = swap = 1gb; /dev/sda3 = / = 10gb; /dev/sda4 = /home = 489gb
