2007-02-10T10:12:00.000Z	funkja		I'm planning on reinstalling Ubuntu. I have a 64 bit processor and I know in the past I have gotten frusterated at the difficulty of finding working packages for amd64 machines. So I've always installed 32 bit ubuntu instead. Would you recommend installing 64 bit ubuntu this time? Explain.
2007-02-10T10:14:00.000Z	vox754	funkja	no, don't install the 64-bit unless you really know what your are doing. I've read it is recommended for headless machines, or servers, not for desktop, everyday users.
2007-02-10T10:15:00.000Z	funkja	vox754	- thanks. That is silly though. 64 bit is the future.
2007-02-10T10:19:00.000Z	vox754	funkja	yes, 64 bit is the future, it is a slow future, though.
