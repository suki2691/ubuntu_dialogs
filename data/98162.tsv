2008-03-08T02:25:00.000Z	siebrand		Hi. I'm suffering from https://launchpad.net/bugs/144685. I cannot make out if it is completely harmess or potentially harmful. Feedback appreciated.
2008-03-08T02:26:00.000Z	Starnestommy	siebrand	try putting "sudo" before that command
2008-03-08T02:26:00.000Z	siebrand	Starnestommy	executed with sudo... (it is a vserver)
2008-03-08T02:28:00.000Z	siebrand	Starnestommy	the report ends with "This has to be a vserver ufs bug". I do not see a reference to a report on the vserver ufs issue, though. That's why I decided to come here.
