2006-07-05T07:50:00.000Z	jeff303	Tonren	do you still have access to the partition?  you can back up your mozilla profile and probably the other things too
2006-07-05T07:50:00.000Z	Tonren	jeff303	I'm on it right now.  I'm burning the 32bit Live CD as we type.  I don't think backing it up will really work, though, now that I think about it, because so many things are specifically written for 64bit.
2006-07-05T07:51:00.000Z	jeff303	Tonren	stuff in the mozilla profile is?  hmm if that's the case then I dunno sorry
