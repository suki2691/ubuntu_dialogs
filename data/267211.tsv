2005-12-12T08:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	barton_	 you mean 'what ftp client are there for ubuntu' ?
2005-12-12T08:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	barton_	 theres literally DOZENS of ftp clients out. :P even the gnome file manager can doit. Depends on what features ya want in one. I recall a 'ftp file system' thing somewhere the could even mount them. (never used that however)
2005-12-12T08:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	barton_	 fire up synaptic and search for 'ftp' and see wht look good.
