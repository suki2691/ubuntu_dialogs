2006-07-16T15:51:00.000Z	Ademan		are there any programs that stream (servers) that convert any file format into a single format (maybe mpeg, or ogg if there is an ogg stream) ?
2006-07-16T15:52:00.000Z	Ademan		like a gstreamer based stream server that outputs ogg stream or something (i don't know if there is an ogg stream... but still)
