2006-08-23T12:43:00.000Z	Tonren	wizard	There isn't really any support for 64bit.  Flash doesn't work, etc.
2006-08-23T12:48:00.000Z	Tonren	wizard	Honestly, I haven't noticed any drop in coolness now that I've switched to 32bit.  I don't really know what the benefits of 64bit are in the first place, and honestly, it seems like a stupid idea to me.  But anyway, 32bit runs just fine on 64bit arch.
