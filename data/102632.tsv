2011-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	rww	usaguy987	Yes. It doesn't install a GUI by default, in fact.
2011-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	rww	usaguy987	It uses bash, not busybox by default. nano is default; for pine you'd want to install the 'alpine' package
2011-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	rww	usaguy987	yes, they should all be there or be installable
