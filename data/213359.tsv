2006-01-01T06:27:00.000Z	ajeet		Hello, I just installed Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos to my Home directory with WINE, but when I goto play it I get a "retry, cannot detect CD-ROM drive, please insert CD and try again", why is this?

2006-01-01T06:29:00.000Z	ajeet	mwe	any ideas where to find such a patch?
