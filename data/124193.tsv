2008-02-12T02:02:00.000Z	pepperjack	unagi	no i hate the new safe mode thing for xorg i like the idea i guess but..  the answer though is no
2008-02-12T02:03:00.000Z	unagi	pepperjack	why cant i get my graphics running again no matter what i do
2008-02-12T02:04:00.000Z	pepperjack	unagi	for some reason i had to manually kill X when i changed xorg for it to work restarting id alt-ctrl-f2 and login and ps -A and if you see anything x related sudo kill -9 pidnumber  then edit the xorg file appropriately and sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart. you may be running into a diff problem though
