2007-05-28T16:13:00.000Z	xelon		Hi, I'm searching for a program that holds program icons at the bottom of the desktop. It's like panel. I see almost all screenshots of the gnome. It's like this http://www.gnome-look.org/CONTENT/content-pre1/26448-1.jpg   . But when the mouse comes over it, the icons are getting bigger. I can't find the name of it. Anyone knows?
