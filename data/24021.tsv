2010-11-05T22:39:00.000Z	fadein		I'm running 10.10 on an ASUS eeePC netbook. Many people have been complaining that the "disable touchpad" hotkey Fn+F3 doesn't work.  I've noticed that it does work in gdm, and it's after logging in to X that it ceases to work.  Can anyone explain what's happening between GDM and X that could cause this?
