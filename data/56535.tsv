2011-11-24T06:23:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	JuJuBee	that happend to a friend of mine.. he was able to restore the songs on the ipod
2011-11-24T06:24:00.000Z	JuJuBee	SolarisBoy	I am trying to sync some playlists she created on computer to her iPod
2011-11-24T06:24:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	JuJuBee	did it put the playlists only and remove her files?
