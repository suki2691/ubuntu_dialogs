2009-12-20T18:10:00.000Z	mastro		a friend of mine installed ubuntu after a fresh installation of windows xp, installation went fine but every times he boot windows (xp sp3) choosing it from grub men√π at the next reboot grub is gone and he has to recover it by live-cd. If i keep using only ubuntu grub stay there like it should
2009-12-20T18:10:00.000Z	mastro		is anyone experience a problem like this or have any idea of what's going on?

2009-12-20T18:17:00.000Z	mastro	anto9us	since that's a fresh installation of windowx xp sp3 i dubt it... but that's the only explanation i could think about myself
