2009-09-13T17:28:00.000Z	Naxzul		guys, im having some trouble trying to set my resolution to 1280x1024. I just installed ubuntu and my xorg.conf does not even have a section for resolutions
2009-09-13T17:28:00.000Z	twright	Naxzul	hi, have you tried doing so via the display tool in gnome
2009-09-13T17:32:00.000Z	twright	Naxzul	in that case I recommend you tried to upgrade to 9.04 again as it will probably work then
2009-09-13T17:33:00.000Z	twright	Naxzul	good luck - if it does not work then I recommend you submit a bug at launchpad.net
