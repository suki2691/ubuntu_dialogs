2009-11-19T06:26:00.000Z	WesleyWex		Hi, I just upgraded 9.04 to 9.10 and I don't have users on my logon screen (I used the basic logon screen)
2009-11-19T06:26:00.000Z	WesleyWex		Anyone know what could I do to fix this?
2009-11-19T06:27:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	WesleyWex	reinstall 9.04 or switch to debian
2009-11-19T06:27:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	WesleyWex	(I'm not in my ubuntu-loving mood right now, so take my advice with a grain of salt)
