2011-01-17T12:47:00.000Z	gusg		how does gedit auto-detect encodings? Do files contain metadata about their encoding? I would kind of like to be able to open any file and see what it looks like in ASCII
2011-01-17T12:49:00.000Z	Lint01	gusg	you will need indexer like tracker & al.
2011-01-17T12:50:00.000Z	gusg	Lint01	isn't there anyway I can do a slow search through the contents with bare Ubuntu?
2011-01-17T12:51:00.000Z	Lint01	gusg	i'm afraid you're limited to grepping utf-8 encoded text files
