2012-07-15T01:01:00.000Z	ikonia	hector549	just ask the question, if someone can help they will
2012-07-15T01:03:00.000Z	ikonia	hector549	why do you think that's a problem with gcc ?
2012-07-15T01:04:00.000Z	ikonia	hector549	ok, so it's either going to be an incompatability between dependencies, a missing dependency or a bug in the code
