2010-05-21T22:34:00.000Z	hanlof_		please somebody.. i get no login prompt on any text console (alt + 1-6) on a freshly installed ubuntu. intel core i7. tons of ram etc. need more hw specs and i'll give it but its pretty standard
2010-05-21T22:35:00.000Z	hanlof_		it must be a known problem with the missing text console?
2010-05-21T22:35:00.000Z	costre	hanlof_	Do you get any text at all? It could be the monitor/graphics carc/both don't like the text mode?
2010-05-21T22:35:00.000Z	hanlof_	costre	yes i get some error message about plymouth-splash
