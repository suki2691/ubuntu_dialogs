2008-08-17T22:49:00.000Z	Gillpy		How do I determine the amount in bytes of a stdout ?
2008-08-17T22:51:00.000Z	unop	Gillpy	please elaborate
2008-08-17T22:54:00.000Z	Gillpy	unop	something I can put in a command which returns the number of bytes passing through a pipe,
2008-08-17T22:55:00.000Z	Gillpy	unop	for example I might type   cat * | command    and the number of bytes of the concatenation of all files in . is printed
