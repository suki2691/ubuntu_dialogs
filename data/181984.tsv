2006-06-28T09:22:00.000Z	LoneShadow		if I have managed to corrupt gcc/g++ or libc, what is the best way to fix this problem ? I get some vague warnings and errors, something of the sort "g++ killed itself due to internal errors"
2006-06-28T09:23:00.000Z	neutrinomass	LoneShadow	"sudo aptitude reinstall build-essential" ?
2006-06-28T09:24:00.000Z	LoneShadow	neutrinomass	will that reinstall all the libraries as well ?
2006-06-28T09:24:00.000Z	neutrinomass	LoneShadow	Well no, you'll have to reinstall those by hand.
