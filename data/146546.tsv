2012-10-01T20:55:00.000Z	Phinnay		is there anything in ubuntu that would be blocking a request to create a TCP port from PHP?
2012-10-01T20:55:00.000Z	Phinnay		i know there is an issue with root for ports LOWER than a certain number, the port in question is 2324
2012-10-01T20:56:00.000Z	Phinnay		think that is above whatever the rooot thingy is
2012-10-01T20:57:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Phinnay	 maybe your router , does it have application support ?
