2007-02-18T13:48:00.000Z	Tsool		Hmm...new try :) Not exactly an Ubuntu-question, but maybe you can help. I have an extern USB-disk that was filled to the brim. I deleted one directory (with a DVD-image in it) to free some space. Oddly enough, the disk was still full. When I run df I get "/dev/sda1 240362656 234346464 0 100% /media/extern". If I read it correctly I have about 6G unused, but no free space. Where's the beef?

2007-02-18T13:49:00.000Z	Tsool	arrenlex	Not if you do it from the command line
2007-02-18T13:49:00.000Z	arrenlex	Tsool	Oh.
