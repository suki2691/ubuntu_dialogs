2006-05-23T14:13:00.000Z	squidgy		Hi.  I have a quick bash question.  I know that if I have a process running in the foreground, I can hit ctrl+z to stop it, followed by 'bg' to run it in the background.  Is there a single keystroke to take a foreground process and background it?

2006-05-23T14:27:00.000Z	squidgy	amphi	 Thanks.  I'm familiar with appending &, but occasionally I'll forget and I was wondering if there was a single-keystroke way to background it, rather than Ctrl+Z followed by typing 'bg'.
