2007-03-16T10:05:00.000Z	runes	ethernomad	where are you
2007-03-16T10:06:00.000Z	runes	ethernomad	do you have a static Ip or can you get one?
2007-03-16T10:08:00.000Z	runes	ethernomad	if you can get a static ip from your provider, ubuntu has an excellent set of server daemons to host your own site--not to mention great support ;-)
