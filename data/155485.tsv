2008-12-03T11:44:00.000Z	anto		one question... I had a little problem. used gparted to move my old windows partition but I have damaged the mbr... is there any tool to fix the mbr of windows? Im unable to find the damn windows cd, you never know where it is when you need it..
2008-12-03T11:45:00.000Z	arrenlex	anto	What specifically is damaged? If the MBR is bad, you wouldn't be able to boot anything... there is no "windows mbr".
2008-12-03T11:45:00.000Z	anto	arrenlex	I wanted to run something like fixmbr or fdisk /mbr
2008-12-03T11:46:00.000Z	arrenlex	anto	What is broken? What would that command do?
