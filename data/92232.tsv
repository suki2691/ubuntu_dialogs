2009-03-28T04:42:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	grigora	a -dev file is a development file, meaning if you wanna code something for it you will need this or also if cyou wanna compile something that needs this
2009-03-28T04:44:00.000Z	grigora	remoteCTRL	thanks, so what's the other one for? considering boost is a library and the only reason you would install it is to use it (link against it, etc).
