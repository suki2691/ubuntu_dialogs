2012-10-28T02:26:00.000Z	knob		Good evening everyone
2012-10-28T02:27:00.000Z	knob		I was wondering: In the command line, I can run a script... and it will output a whole bunch of text.   How can I pipe that into a text file?
2012-10-28T02:27:00.000Z	knob		Will this work?      ./script.sh | echo log.txt    ?
