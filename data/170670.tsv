2006-08-16T10:28:00.000Z	lindy		Has anyone else run into the problem where all the windoze long file names on a DVD are all 8 characters when looking at them from Ubuntu?
2006-08-16T10:29:00.000Z	Ng	lindy	the ISO format for CD/DVDs has stupid 8 character filename limits. There are two extensions to fix it, Joliet and RockRidge. Joliet is for windows and RockRidge is for UNIX. presumably the disc you have only has Joliet extensions
2006-08-16T10:31:00.000Z	lindy	Ng	Oh that's it.  thanks very much.  Then I need to make sure the DVD is written using Joliet.  I did see some mention of that in Linux Mag.  Thanks!  Funny though, why does Windows read it ok?  Or does this mean I should be writing it with RockRidge AND Joliet?
