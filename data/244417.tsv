2005-08-31T10:38:00.000Z	Rangitoto		I am thinking of buying a computer which has a 700MHz Celeron and 128Mb RAM. Is that satisfactory for Ubuntu?

2005-08-31T10:39:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Rangitoto	how much are you planning on paying? i spent $400 on a amd 64 3000+, 512 MB PC3200 DDR, 160 GB 7200 RPM seagate, DVD-RW dual-layer etc.
