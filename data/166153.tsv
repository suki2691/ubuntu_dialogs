2006-10-01T08:59:00.000Z	XiXaQ		I've installed two new harddisks. One is external and one internal. I'd like to have them automatically mounted when I boot and unmounted when I shut down. I also want them in Computer. How do I accomplish this?
2006-10-01T09:00:00.000Z	XiXaQ		isn't there any gui for it?
2006-10-01T09:00:00.000Z	XiXaQ		I'd like one.
