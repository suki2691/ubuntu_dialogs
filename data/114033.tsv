2008-01-22T18:12:00.000Z	AmirB		Hey guys. As much as I'm sorry to have to do it, I have to delete Ubuntu from my computer. I'm giving it away and the new owner doesn't want linux :(. Anyways, I'm dual booting Ubuntu and Vista and was wondering how I go about deleting Ubuntu. Do I just delete the partition? I've heard some bad things about that...so how do I go about doing this oh so vexing task?
