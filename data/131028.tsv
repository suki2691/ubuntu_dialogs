2008-05-09T09:30:00.000Z	Konam		man, after the last update I lost my sound, it isn't working anymore. When I go to preferences>sound and test it I get this "audiotestsrc wave=sine freq=512 ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! gconfaudiosink profile=music: Failed to connect stream: Invalid argument"
2008-05-09T09:31:00.000Z	secret901	Konam	what are you going through?
2008-05-09T09:31:00.000Z	Konam	secret901	no sound and getting a weird error
2008-05-09T09:32:00.000Z	secret901	Konam	I had that problem when I installed the beta, but resolved it by rebuilding the kernel
