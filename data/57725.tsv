2009-05-09T09:26:00.000Z	tvn2009		I would like to phone talk to my family (who has Windows)  - other than skype,  what other options do I have on Ubuntu ?
2009-05-09T09:27:00.000Z	mzz	tvn2009	ekiga, iirc, but I haven't used that myself.
2009-05-09T09:27:00.000Z	tvn2009	mzz	if I use ekiga then what would my family use (on Windows) ?
2009-05-09T09:27:00.000Z	mzz	tvn2009	netmeeting, probably. See gnomemeeting.org
