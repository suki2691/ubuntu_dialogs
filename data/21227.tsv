2010-12-29T00:43:00.000Z	Nyghtbyte		Hey, could anyone help me with drivers for a Zotac IONX-A-U? My HD audio (optical) isn't working, and neither are the manufacturer's drivers

2010-12-29T00:45:00.000Z	Nyghtbyte	makosblade	That depends on whether or not the person already has a Live CD. That and virtualbox isn't exactly user firendly at times
2010-12-29T00:46:00.000Z	makosblade	Nyghtbyte	I suppose. I found it pretty foolproof in my last few uses. I just like that you can be running both of your OSes at the same time so you can keep multitasking
