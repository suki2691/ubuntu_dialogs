2008-03-25T16:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	KrisWood	 define 'zero rights' :)
2008-03-25T16:30:00.000Z	KrisWood	Dr_willis	I've got an svn server running on my linux box for one of my dev groups, but I don't want the dev team to have access to the rest of the box, just svn
2008-03-25T16:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	KrisWood	 i recall setting a users shell to 'false' as one way to prevent logins
