2006-11-25T09:14:00.000Z	DexterF		hey
2006-11-25T09:14:00.000Z	DexterF		is there a live CD with fglrx so I can have a look at how well AIGLX works before installing?
2006-11-25T09:15:00.000Z	anton_	DexterF	difficult, the drivers for nvidia and ati graphics cards can#t be distributed like that
2006-11-25T09:16:00.000Z	DexterF	anton_	so I'd have to figure deb sources for fglrx that work with 6.10, install those and then restart aiglx instead of X - am I right so far?
