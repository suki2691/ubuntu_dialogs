2009-10-08T07:09:00.000Z	exe		How do I get the most latest version of python installed
2009-10-08T07:09:00.000Z	fsufitch	exe	2.6 or 3.0?
2009-10-08T07:10:00.000Z	fsufitch	exe	since 2.7 isn't in the ubuntu repos, then it's not supported by the ubuntu crew. python.org probably has a way to manually install 2.7, though
2009-10-08T07:11:00.000Z	fsufitch	exe	it looks like 2.7 is in alpha/PEP stage. no wonder it's not supported: it doesn't exist yet!
