2010-11-06T00:33:00.000Z	Bink_		er well, kind of sick with working on it anyways.. guess i'll do with the ugly grub.
2010-11-06T00:34:00.000Z	rigved	Bink_	it's actually because ubuntu does not use burg by default
2010-11-06T00:35:00.000Z	Bink_	rigved	as i said, others seem to have no problem with it
