2009-08-06T19:26:00.000Z	grumbel		Is there a way to uninstall everything installed afterwards and bring Ubuntu back to its original default install? Or where can I find a list of packages that are installed by default on Ubuntu
2009-08-06T19:28:00.000Z	potyl	grumbel	dpkg -l
2009-08-06T19:29:00.000Z	grumbel	potyl	that gives me everything currently installed, I want to know which packages Ubuntu installs per default
2009-08-06T19:29:00.000Z	potyl	grumbel	ah, sorry
