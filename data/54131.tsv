2009-08-26T01:19:00.000Z	mermshaus		Hi! I'm looking for a remotely efficient way to capture 3D output (like a 3D game played under wine).  The best I can get is about 20 FPS at a resolution of roughly 450x330 px using xvidcap. Any ideas how to do this "right"? Thanks

2009-08-26T01:23:00.000Z	mermshaus	ibuclaw	Thank you. Do you have any experience doing sth like that? I'm asking because I am not sure whether these "screencast" applications are able to record 3D at all. (Sry, I'm not familiar at all with this kind of stuff. :))
