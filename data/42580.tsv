2010-07-30T16:59:00.000Z	BasSiebring		As of today, Empathy doesn't connect anymore to the MSN network. I tried to uninstall and reinstall, tried with and without telepathy-butterfly (saw that mentioned in one of the bug trackers). No luck for me? How can I make Empathy work again like it did yesterday?
