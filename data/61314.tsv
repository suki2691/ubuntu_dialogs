2009-03-31T04:17:00.000Z	sbt		I have a new ibm thinkpad x200 with a core2 and 4gb of ram. I recently installed ubuntu, but only 2.9gb of ram is visible. somebody suggested to me that I should try to install the 64 bit version to make use of all the ram. What should I do?
2009-03-31T04:18:00.000Z	tacoma949	sbt	go 64
2009-03-31T04:19:00.000Z	sbt	tacoma949	I thought core2 was a 32bit proc. will it work automatically with 64 bit?
2009-03-31T04:19:00.000Z	tacoma949	sbt	ya just g 64
