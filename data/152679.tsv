2011-03-09T05:58:00.000Z	Lars_G		Could someone help me turn this repo url into a deb line please? I can't figure out how since it doesn't have the deb distro subdir structure. http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:/OpenVAS:/STABLE:/v3/xUbuntu_10.10/
2011-03-09T06:00:00.000Z	Lars_G		Altough Linus took an architectural route that Tannenbaum finds ridiculous
2011-03-09T06:01:00.000Z	arand	Lars_G	That doesn't look like a standard debian repo. Don't know if it will work at all.
2011-03-09T06:01:00.000Z	Lars_G	arand	I think I'll just get the debs
