2008-06-07T11:49:00.000Z	quantumelixir		When I installed ubuntu I created a 2 GB sawp partition just in case. But I already have 2GB of RAM. How useful is the swap space really?
2008-06-07T11:50:00.000Z	drash	quantumelixir	you will not need much of it for swapping, but perhaps as a resume space (if you use hibernate/sleep functions)
2008-06-07T11:51:00.000Z	quantumelixir	drash	cant it use the normal ext3 partitions for hibernation?
2008-06-07T11:51:00.000Z	drash	quantumelixir	sure, resumes faster from a separate partiton that's all
