2005-01-22T11:07:00.000Z	thully_		what is everybody using here, warty or hoary?  is hoary >stable or <stable than sid
2005-01-22T11:08:00.000Z	thully_		you mean a new gnome development release (as in, a new 2.9.x), right?
2005-01-22T11:08:00.000Z	Keybuk	thully_	yeah, we track gnome very closely and tend to upload 2.9 series the same day they release it
