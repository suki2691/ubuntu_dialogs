2009-01-11T19:37:00.000Z	titon__		Hey i would like to backup my running ubuntu system with all the packages i have installed in order to reinstall with a fully encrypted system
2009-01-11T19:37:00.000Z	titon__		what tool would be good to ghost my installation
2009-01-11T19:38:00.000Z	Jeruvy	titon__	if I was doing that, I would first start with validated CD's like an alternate CD, and build from that.  I would hose any prior install.
2009-01-11T19:40:00.000Z	titon__	Jeruvy	yea but i would like to save the install i have and just write over the new install
