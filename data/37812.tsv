2010-02-20T16:08:00.000Z	RadicalDreamer		I have a problem with my wireless card. It stopped working. In lshw it looks "disabled".
2010-02-20T16:08:00.000Z	RadicalDreamer		Seems the logical name of the card is wmaster0, but on iwconfig I see only an association to wlan0.
2010-02-20T16:08:00.000Z	RadicalDreamer		Can anybody help me?
