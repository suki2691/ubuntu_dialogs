2005-03-31T12:12:00.000Z	MMMond	arek	Eh? o.0 Sounds odd, for at least php5, I would imagine . . . however, I know little of this . . . if you say so, I suppose you must be right
2005-03-31T12:12:00.000Z	arek	MMMond	some php modules will not be safe with apache2
2005-03-31T12:20:00.000Z	MMMond	arek	Would you  happen to know? if having apache2 installed at the same time as having apache1.3 . . . cause any conflictions? The guy who was helping me, JDahl . . . said he had both installed, and had them working correctly
