2012-02-08T21:25:00.000Z	xxxxxx		i had the same problem with a black splash screen. To fix it i used the grub boot repair disc
2012-02-08T21:26:00.000Z	xxxxxx		with the repair disc there is an option to show splash screen without the need to re-install grub or mess about with any settings
2012-02-08T21:27:00.000Z	xxxxxx		windows sucks
2012-02-08T21:27:00.000Z	qo_op	xxxxxx	then try out ubuntu :)
