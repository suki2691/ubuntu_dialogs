Cause I have seen fedora 12 with gnome and it seems to be lacking the volume panel applet as well when pulseaudio is removed from the system. So Im assuming this has been a Gnome change and therefore its a cross distro change for better or worse.

2009-12-07T04:43:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	DeSian	Yes I know the workaround but Im wondering if it was a decision by Gnome or Ubuntu devs.
2009-12-07T04:45:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	DeSian	BTW who would I need to run alsamixer with sudo? It runs fine without it. Is there a reason Im not aware of?
