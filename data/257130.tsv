2004-12-20T13:51:00.000Z	farruinn		aka, I see ipw2100 and ipw2200 listed, looks like people have had more luck with the 2200, or the 2100 hasn't been tested much
2004-12-20T13:52:00.000Z	akabigbro	farruinn	that was very helpfull, the DWL-650+ is supported just as the ipw2100 and yes the ipw2200 is; Thank you very much.
