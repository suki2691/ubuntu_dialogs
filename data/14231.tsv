2011-05-16T19:56:00.000Z	Pendrag0n1		 On my ubuntu box, in, I need to look at word documents in linux/bash commands, and know if they are encrypted by word or not.  with docx files I can use the strings command I search for the word encrypted, but with regular .doc documents, I don't see any way of telling if they are or not.  Any ideas?
