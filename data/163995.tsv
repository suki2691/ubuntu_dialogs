2007-03-29T08:28:00.000Z	tom_nessie_dappe		i mounted 6.10 iso to /mnt/iso on 6.06
2007-03-29T08:28:00.000Z	tom_nessie_dappe		and what to use it upgrade rather than doing it online
2007-03-29T08:28:00.000Z	bulmer	tom_nessie_dappe	am not sure but i would assume just like the cdrom as the source, but instead of "cdrom://" maybe "file://"
