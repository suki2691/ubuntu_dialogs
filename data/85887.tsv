2011-01-31T15:40:00.000Z	Ascavasaion		I have an AMD Duron 1300MHz machine, 30Gb HDD and 384M RAM.  I have two different graphics cards and two monitors.  What Distro would run the best on it?  I tried Puppy, but its kernel does not allow VGA arbiter which is key to enabling dual display support.  Any advice pelase.

2011-01-31T15:42:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	david__	No, the Xorg file I understand... but the Xorg.0.log file shows that the kernel itself cannot do that feature.  I need to know what lightweight distro can.
