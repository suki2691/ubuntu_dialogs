2011-11-13T15:36:00.000Z	Guest86830		I'm running a pretty crappy HP Pavilion a1720n and Ubuntu 11.10 runs LIKE CRAP on it. Any ideas on what I might need to upgrade to get it running smoothly?
2011-11-13T15:38:00.000Z	r0gue	Guest86830	use some lightweight env such as xfce
2011-11-13T15:39:00.000Z	r0gue	Guest86830	then use Linux Mint in that distro upgrading is not compulsory whereas in ubuntu upgrading is necessary
