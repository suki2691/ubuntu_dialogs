2012-07-20T12:23:00.000Z	Error404NotFound		Any m17x owners here? I installed 12.04 just now and notice that it doesn't charge when i replugged power adapter. /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/state shows off-line though adapter is plugged in. If i reboot then ubuntu detects it, google says its a common issue with no solution besides power cycle.

2012-07-20T12:26:00.000Z	Error404NotFound	histo	and ubuntu isn't a software? :)
2012-07-20T12:28:00.000Z	Error404NotFound	histo	perhaps you wanted to say 'hardware'. And no, its not hardware. Same adapter and battery works if they are plugged in on boot. However, if i boot into ubuntu, remove power adapter, do some work and plugin adapter back it, its not detected by acpi.
