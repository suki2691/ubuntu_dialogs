2011-05-19T15:59:00.000Z	Kuwanger		I have an odd problem.  About 50% of the time when I boot, my mouse cursor is corrupt and various pixmaps on the screen are corrupt as well (although a lot oddly aren't).  Meanwhile, a screen grab looks much more corrupt than the real screen does.  The only major difference I've noticed is that the kernel module load order is different. :/

2011-05-19T16:02:00.000Z	cousin_mario	Kuwanger	is it still used in these pci-express days?
2011-05-19T16:02:00.000Z	Kuwanger	cousin_mario	No idea.  But I assume some people still have agp cards.
