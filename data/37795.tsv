2010-08-19T07:27:00.000Z	tehuff		hello... I have a clean install of ubuntu 10.04.  everything installed ok, but the generic SVGA driver was a little glitchy w/ my 64MB ATI agp 9200 card.  so, I upgrade via pkg manager to the incld. ATI drivers.  Big improvement.  But, now my fav screensaver glMATRIX doesn't work?  Am I missing some 3D lib?  What do I need to configure?  TIA.
2010-08-19T07:28:00.000Z	tehuff		anything I can do?
2010-08-19T07:29:00.000Z	tehuff		bummer... luv that MATRIX screensaver  :(
