2010-06-03T14:29:00.000Z	KungFuBear	Visseroth	hrm, I've never run Win in a VM. I'll look into that, thank you
2010-06-03T14:31:00.000Z	KungFuBear	Visseroth	Thanks, I'll do that
2010-06-03T14:47:00.000Z	KungFuBear	Visseroth	Is it realistic to be able to run Windows through a VM on linux for things like gaming and such?
