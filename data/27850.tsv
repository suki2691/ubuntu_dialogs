2010-08-05T22:02:00.000Z	wineuser		Hi, how do I know which nVidia driver to use for my card (which one from the repos I mean)
2010-08-05T22:02:00.000Z	xangua	wineuser	system>administracion>hardware support, wich one recomendsÂ¿
2010-08-05T22:06:00.000Z	wineuser	xangua	I don't have 'hardware support', but have 'hardware drivers support' (I believe it invokes 'jockey-gtk')
2010-08-05T22:06:00.000Z	wineuser	xangua	But it doesn't recommend any. I had the wrong driver (swapped an FX 5200 for a GeForce 6200)
