2010-10-29T16:17:00.000Z	Onyx47		so, no one has a clue about some disk utility that could help me? I'd go with manufacturer's bootable CD but my DVD drive is giving up and I didn't manage to boot it from USB

2010-10-29T16:20:00.000Z	Onyx47	trendsetter37	I did find some instructions but it involved using grub1 which I didn't have on hand and a version of freedos that's old as hell, my try-and-hope approach just resulted in grub2 giving up on me and telling me to go to hell :P
