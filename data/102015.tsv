2008-03-26T14:14:00.000Z	unop_	danand	upgrades are not always necessary -- and you should be aware of the fact that upgrades _can_ break things, which is why some administrators do not install upgrades each time one is available but put them through review first
2008-03-26T14:19:00.000Z	danand	unop_	- agreed. but this is a brand new install... better to start with a fully up to date box. I can see your point about reviewing packages that have upgrades available - i always check what apt is gonna do.... but for a fresh install, I always grab all the available updates and security fixes... Just my personal pref i guess. However he should _definately_ perform upgrades required due to security
2008-03-26T14:22:00.000Z	danand	unop_	- yeah :)
