I'm trying to install Ubuntu 11.04b2 on an Asus EEE 1005HA netbook, but when it gets to the keyboard-configuration part of the install, it hangs for about a minute then restarts the machine. I've tried both the standard install and the alternate install with no luck. Any ideas?

2011-04-24T01:37:00.000Z	rhizmoe	ultradan	just a reboot?
