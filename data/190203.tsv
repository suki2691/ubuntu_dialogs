2006-06-22T05:43:00.000Z	Sanne	Warbo	yes, it's insane at first, but insanely awesome if you keep at it ;)
2006-06-22T05:43:00.000Z	Warbo	Sanne	I have made 1 pic so far, but I am great in the GIMP (so I usually cheat and do crappy stuff in Blender then touch it up after)
2006-06-22T05:44:00.000Z	Sanne	Warbo	that's fine, just use what's best for the job :)
