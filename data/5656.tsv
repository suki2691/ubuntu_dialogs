2012-02-17T14:35:00.000Z	greenit		hi, i have a problem: i am writing an email, but when i toggle the email-window to full-screen the text is not end in the line like it does before.... can i change this behavior anyhow or do i just have to press enter everytime i want the line to end?

2012-02-17T14:39:00.000Z	greenit	themonitor	can i change this behavior, for example that the line does not get longer so that it fits on an a4-site?
2012-02-17T14:40:00.000Z	themonitor	greenit	I don't think so.
