2008-06-22T21:27:00.000Z	jussi01	sdtr443w	yes
2008-06-22T21:28:00.000Z	sdtr443w	jussi01	If the Device URI field is something like "socket://192.168.0.100:9100" should I assume it has the location right if that matches the printer's URL?
2008-06-22T21:29:00.000Z	jussi01	sdtr443w	without knowing more about your setuop, its hard to tell exactly how it should be, but I need to run right now. perhaps others can help.
