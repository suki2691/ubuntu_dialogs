2010-07-19T18:39:00.000Z	DrPoO		what do u guys recommend for a backup solution. I have an external drive, I have been using simple-backup but it does not seem to be very reliable (changes the location of the backups at random)... any suggestions?

2010-07-19T18:41:00.000Z	DrPoO	llutz	I had thought of something similar but wanted to see if there were known packages that already do this
2010-08-18T01:35:00.000Z	llutz	DrPoO	use debootstrap
