2009-11-21T21:38:00.000Z	ericdb		I just got a replacement laptop, same hardware, because of a physical flaw in the first one.  What's the best way to replicate my Ubuntu install to the new laptop?  I don't want to swap hard drives because the new one has Win 7, and I'd rather screw with Ubuntu than with upgrading Vista->7.
