2007-03-03T08:47:00.000Z	preaction	superbenny	k = KDE, x = XFCE, u = Gnome
2007-03-03T08:47:00.000Z	preaction	superbenny	it's the desktop system the distribution uses
2007-03-03T08:48:00.000Z	preaction	superbenny	KDE is big on the flashiness, and sometimes better on the UI. gnome is supposed to be more accessible, and xfce is for slow comps or comps that need higher performance (or less GUI, but not none)
