2007-09-13T15:13:00.000Z	heartsblood		Just so I'm clear, what is the name of the recomended nvidia driver package? apt-get install nvidia-glx-new?
2007-09-13T15:15:00.000Z	heartsblood		nvidia-glx didn't support my card, and nvidia-glx-new isn't loading glx for some reason
2007-09-13T15:16:00.000Z	heartsblood		does nvidia still have their driver manual in a README?  all I can find is this pita html file.
