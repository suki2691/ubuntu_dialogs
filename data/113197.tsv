2011-04-17T15:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DirtyDawg	 i seem to recall some widgit  that gave a compositing on/off toggle.. but cant recall where
2011-05-28T12:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DirtyDawg	 easy way. install ssh on both. set up 'sshfs' so you can mount the remote box to a local directory. Samba and the normal shareing method can work also.
