2005-08-29T07:48:00.000Z	LexiCon		has anyone installed a Yukon Gigabit network card and gotten it to work?
2005-08-29T07:48:00.000Z	LexiCon		it uses the sk98lin module, which is packed with the kernel
2005-08-29T07:49:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	LexiCon	that was one hell of a specific question...
2005-08-29T07:50:00.000Z	LexiCon	EasterSunshine	yes...lol....because it's supposed to work with the supplied module, but it doesn't...so I'm wondering if anyone else has gotten the Yukon card to work (its by Marvell)
