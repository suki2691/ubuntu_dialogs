2007-08-06T07:37:00.000Z	mr_dude	Mr	What did you do recently that would cause this problem?
2007-08-06T07:40:00.000Z	mr_dude	Mr	What did you try to install?  You need to be very specific so everyone can understand you.  All I know so far is that you couldn't get into X for some unknown reason.
2007-08-06T07:42:00.000Z	mr_dude	Mr	So you tried to install Ubuntu and when the install was over you couldn't get into the login screen because it crashes?
