2011-04-27T01:28:00.000Z	aroman		Hi, I've got a new laptop and I want to run Ubuntu on it, but the drivers that I need for wifi/graphics aren't in Maverick's kernel. They are however in Natty's. I've got Maverick on the laptop now. Is there a way I can upgrade to natty on it, right now?

2011-04-27T10:04:00.000Z	Squall5668	aroman	1)natty is not supported here, goto #ubuntu+1 2) i recommend you don't do that since unity relies HEAVILY on compiz
