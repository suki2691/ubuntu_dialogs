2010-08-04T01:20:00.000Z	kyentei		Is anybody familiar with another way of stopping "Recent Documents" to show up in places under GNOME? (I now remove .recently-used.xbel and create a folder with that name, but that gives gtk errors)

2010-08-04T01:21:00.000Z	kyentei	histo	Searched a lot, can't find anything
2010-08-04T01:21:00.000Z	histo	kyentei	i'm sure someone on the forums has posted a way to get rid of recent documents
