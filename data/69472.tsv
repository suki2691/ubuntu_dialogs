2009-03-08T21:36:00.000Z	Agent_AL	Vigo	- typical tool window for config settings manager in Ubuntu 8.10, I set friction for vobble window style to extremely low value and as a result I got that window away from screen, but it was still open. I was wondering, if there's a chance to get a particular window centered on desktop?
2009-03-08T21:39:00.000Z	Agent_AL	Vigo	- I guess it is Compiz config window
2009-03-08T21:41:00.000Z	Agent_AL	Vigo	- oh I see, thanks
