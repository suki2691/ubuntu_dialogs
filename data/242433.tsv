2007-03-16T14:31:00.000Z	carter		hi - I'm new to LINUX and UBUNTU... I'm having trouble finding how to run installed apps - for example, imagemagick. It is installed, but does not show up in the "Applications" menu, nor can I run imagemagick from a terminal. What to do?

2007-03-16T14:33:00.000Z	gordonjcp	carter	but it's useful in the way a spanner is useful
2007-03-16T14:34:00.000Z	gordonjcp	carter	if you had a huge bunch of pics from your camera, and wanted to rescale them all to web size and thumbnail size, imagemagick and a bit of scripting would do it for you in moments
