2009-10-07T05:17:00.000Z	dgs_		shutdown -h/-r now is failing on my system (9.04). it's just immediately returning (as though it is shutting down) w/ no errors . . . but nothing else ever happens.
2009-10-07T05:17:00.000Z	dgs_		is there a way to force a shutdown?
2009-10-07T05:17:00.000Z	dgs_		hmm, other than a hard reset :p
2009-10-07T05:17:00.000Z	PovAddict	dgs_	try 'poweroff'? (although I think that just calls shutdown)
