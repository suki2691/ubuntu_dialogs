2007-08-12T15:31:00.000Z	vocx	zerokill88	it is not hard, most guides for that are old, and besides most packages have a README or INSTALL files telling you what to do.
2007-08-12T15:32:00.000Z	zerokill88	vocx	true, but when it says somehting like you need QT 3.2 or whatever, and you apt-cache search to install it, and theres like 20 different QT's, i want to know how to know what one to install
2007-08-12T15:34:00.000Z	vocx	zerokill88	that information should be ultimately provided by the developer. He should say use "qt3.4" or something. I don't believe it is a huge confusion.
