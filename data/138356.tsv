2007-04-20T10:21:00.000Z	Alfonzo		hey guys, so i just installed the "R" statistics package from the package manager, but im trying to also install the gui for it. i believe i installed the gui, but im not seeing R or the R gui in the applications menu. How can I figure out where they are, or the command to launch them? I can launch the console based R by typing "R", but I really need to be using the gui.

2007-04-20T10:22:00.000Z	Alfonzo	magnetron	well locate R pulls up a lot of stuff, is there any way to narrow it down?
