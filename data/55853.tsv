2009-08-10T01:07:00.000Z	mroc	Mithran	 i'm not entirely sure what all the options i have actually mean.  nothing stood out as obvious to me.
2009-08-10T01:08:00.000Z	Mithran	mroc	Ah. Thought I'd check, since I originally had a problem with that on my laptop. Didn't realize I had to set my headphone volume independently.
