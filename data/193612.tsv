2006-07-16T06:59:00.000Z	kdean06		I've got kind of a long list of requirements in a voice and video messagning client, is anyone here familiar with the topic that can help me?
2006-07-16T07:01:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	kdean06	for voice, skype. For video, gnome-meeting (or whatever its called these days).

I require both video and voice at the same time, and it must interoperate with Windows users who may or may not know anything beyond installing a simple, single binary.
