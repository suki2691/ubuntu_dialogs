2006-04-20T10:23:00.000Z	Jimmni		Does anyone have any idea why none of the install CDs I'm burning in Mac OS X are bootable? :(
2006-04-20T10:25:00.000Z	Jimmni		No, when I put the CDs into the drive, they mount, but they're not letting me boot
2006-04-20T10:25:00.000Z	Jimmni		I tried using both Disk Utility and Toast
2006-04-20T10:25:00.000Z	kingspawn	Jimmni	turned on booting off a cd in your bios?
