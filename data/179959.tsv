2006-11-10T10:07:00.000Z	TheReconHunter		Hey. I just compiled a gparted package sucessfully, but for some reason, when i try using gparted, it brings me to the old version. anyone know why?
2006-11-10T10:08:00.000Z	jrib	TheReconHunter	how did you install it?
2006-11-10T10:14:00.000Z	jrib	TheReconHunter	no, then use checkinstall (you'll need to install it)
2006-11-10T10:15:00.000Z	jrib	TheReconHunter	though if you are on the livecd it doesn't matter much if you just do 'sudo make install'
