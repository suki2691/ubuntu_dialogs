2007-10-11T06:16:00.000Z	TaQ		Hi there, can I safely remove mono from Ubuntu latest versions? Or is it tied to ubuntu-desktop?
2007-10-11T06:17:00.000Z	`Matir	TaQ	-- I don't have mono installed with no noticeable side effects.
2007-10-11T06:18:00.000Z	`Matir	TaQ	and either synaptic or apt will warn if it tries to remove ubuntu-desktop.
2007-10-11T06:25:00.000Z	TaQ	`Matir	Thanks! I don't want that stuff around there. Will remove tonight. :-)
