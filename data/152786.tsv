2009-08-15T02:05:00.000Z	arand	Bonner	I got a netgear card working using ndiswarapper, might be a different card though, and this was on puppy linux.
2009-08-15T02:08:00.000Z	arand	Bonner	I think I used these drivers: http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=290470#290470 along with ndiswrapper.
2009-08-15T02:09:00.000Z	arand	Bonner	but again, that might well be a completely different make than your card.
2009-08-15T02:11:00.000Z	arand	Bonner	ah, well then the issue might be otherwise.
