2007-11-05T10:20:00.000Z	Evanlec	TheCougar	there's partition manager (gparted), testdisk, and fsck
2007-11-05T10:22:00.000Z	TheCougar	Evanlec	does any of them do diagnostics to see if the drive is bad?
2007-11-05T10:23:00.000Z	Evanlec	TheCougar	testdisk and fsck will, testdisk is mostly used for data recovery from bad drives, fsck is like windows' chkdsk utility
