2006-03-20T10:59:00.000Z	ecen		hello, i have this little problem. in nautilus (as root) i accidentally moved one of the main directories in the file system and it landed in another directory. the thing is that i didnt even see which directory is missing. so my question is: is there a way to make undo in nautilus? so the last action is restored? or can anyone give me the directory structure of the file system so i can tell which directory is missing
