2007-06-20T10:57:00.000Z	sdac		hi, is there any diference between installing KDE on xubuntu fiesty... and downloading kubuntu fiesty directly ?   I already have xubuntu
2007-06-20T10:58:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	sdac	if you do the former, you'll have XFCE + KDE
2007-06-20T10:58:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	sdac	and if you just DL Kubuntu Feisty directly, you'll just have KDE.
2007-06-20T10:58:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	sdac	no downside if you have enough HDD space.  :)
