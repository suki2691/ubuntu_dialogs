2006-05-18T14:06:00.000Z	Kane666		i have a question regarding a proxy server, windows and ubuntu ;)
2006-05-18T14:07:00.000Z	Kane666		ive installed a proxy server on my windows machine to share dial-up. Ubuntu is configured to connect through it, and it works fine,, (im using it now) but every now and then, i get a connection refused error and i either have to close the proxy server and re-open it or get a new static ip... any ideas?

2006-05-18T14:09:00.000Z	Kane666	DBO	nah its not, thats what i thougt... so i downloaded a new proxy and gave it a try and the same thing happens
