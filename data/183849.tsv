2006-12-23T06:44:00.000Z	teratorn		how do I disable gdm and enable logging in through the Linux console?
2006-12-23T06:44:00.000Z	matallo	teratorn	just press ctrl+f1
2006-12-23T06:44:00.000Z	teratorn		(I know how to prevent gdm from starting.. but that still doesn't get me to a text console)
2006-12-23T06:47:00.000Z	teratorn	matallo	yeah, I was just wondering if there was some way to make VT1 the default
