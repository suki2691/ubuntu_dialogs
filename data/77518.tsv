2009-07-22T02:15:00.000Z	losher	gletob	how about echo "Update completed at `date`"  <--- note backticks inside double quotes
2009-07-22T02:15:00.000Z	gletob	losher	that'll work, thank you so much.
2009-07-22T02:16:00.000Z	losher	gletob	also see 'man date' for options to the date command with +format to make it look any way you like
