2009-07-05T06:38:00.000Z	shaullx		will ie4linux do the job?
2009-07-05T06:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	shaullx	 theres some wine 'things' that let you use netscape/firefox instead of ie in many situations.
2009-07-05T06:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	shaullx	  that may or may not be 'true'  so try what you want I guess.
