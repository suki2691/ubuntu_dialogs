2009-01-14T22:18:00.000Z	kane77		how can I run a certain command once every 5 minutes? (don't really want to put it into cron)
2009-01-14T22:19:00.000Z	StanBR	kane77	You can make a script using ruby or whatever... and use a sleep.
2009-01-14T22:19:00.000Z	StanBR	kane77	oh yeah, the watch command.. is better
2009-01-14T22:20:00.000Z	kane77	StanBR	not that bad idea.. I love ruby actually, but I forget about it when it comes to scripting.. need to use it more
