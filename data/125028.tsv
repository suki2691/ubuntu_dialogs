2007-11-29T06:19:00.000Z	whitewisper		there is no flash player on 64, u must install 32 version but first u must have 32 internet browser
2007-11-29T06:19:00.000Z	whitewisper		or choose alternative like gnash
2007-11-29T06:20:00.000Z	scguy318	whitewisper	as I said to Pelo, on Gutsy the flashplugin-nonfree package seamlessly handles installation on 64-bit by integrating the nspluginwrapper solution
