2008-07-17T12:57:00.000Z	speedRS		Is it possible to run compiz with dual screens using nvidia twinview at a resolution higher than 1024x768 for both monitors without incurring a Comparing resolution to maximum 3d texture size-type error?
2008-07-17T12:58:00.000Z	speedRS		I can only seem to run it at 1024x768 successfully.
