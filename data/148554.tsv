2007-02-05T13:09:00.000Z	fliptop		hi all - can someone help me troubleshoot my AgereSystems modem installation?
2007-02-05T13:10:00.000Z	fliptop		i followed the wiki instructions, and sl-modem-daemon sets up /dev/ttySl0, minicom allows me to send an atz command, but atdt <#> produces 'NO CARRIER'
2007-02-05T13:12:00.000Z	bauer77	fliptop	Are you sure the modem is working properly?
2007-02-05T13:13:00.000Z	fliptop	bauer77	 i can't test it by dialing, but my experience w/ linux is if you can send an atz in minicom it should work.
