2006-06-01T07:55:00.000Z	delire	phreekbird	you shouldn't need to edit the sources.list directly..
2006-06-01T07:58:00.000Z	delire	phreekbird	i don't know what's up there. i just downloaded http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/breezy/universe/binary-i386/Packages.gz and gunzipped it ok.
2006-06-01T07:59:00.000Z	delire	phreekbird	i don't use the US mirrors however so cannot see if the same problem is replicated here.
