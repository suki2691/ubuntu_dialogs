2005-11-05T06:23:00.000Z	icewt	JDigital	by using some better media player instead ;)
2005-11-05T06:24:00.000Z	icewt	JDigital	what is the player that crashes then?
2005-11-05T06:26:00.000Z	icewt	JDigital	oh. well, VLC does support subtitles too, but it's not that good in displaying them. i've used mostly kaffeine if mplayer didn't work, but it's kde application.
