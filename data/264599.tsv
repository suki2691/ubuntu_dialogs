2005-11-04T16:18:00.000Z	ph8		Hey all, I switched from Kde to gnome yesterday, finally got xine working instead of the totem (:s) and now I've installed amarok, I've just watched a movie with sound - no problems but now i want to listen to some music and I can't get any sound? Is it something simple?
