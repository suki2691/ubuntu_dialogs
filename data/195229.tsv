2006-05-01T13:50:00.000Z	Jimmey__		Guys and Gals, I've followed the guide at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WindowsXPPrinter, but am still unable to send print jobs ( sucessfully ) to my HP Deskjet 810c
2006-05-01T13:50:00.000Z	Jimmey__		Any ideas?
2006-05-01T13:52:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Jimmey__	are you sure XP has printer shared?
