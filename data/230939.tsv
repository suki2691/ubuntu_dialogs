2006-06-02T08:39:00.000Z	load		is anyone else having problems with the e100 driver after the dapper update?
2006-06-02T08:39:00.000Z	load		the module loads, sees the card but I can't bring up eth0
2006-06-02T08:40:00.000Z	FirstLite	load	I had problems with e100 in one of the betas.  I never fixed them :(  Earlier Ubuntu kernels worked, though, IIRC
2006-06-02T08:43:00.000Z	FirstLite	load	I wish I'd followed up on that.  Maybe it's just broken.  You could try compiling a newer kernel (with Ubuntu config) from kernel.org, maybe
