2009-09-12T11:00:00.000Z	djbpython		i can't get tcpdump to work, and i suspect its because i am trying to use my wireless interface, any ideas?
2009-09-12T11:01:00.000Z	djbpython		using "sudo tcpdump -i wlan0'
2009-09-12T11:01:00.000Z	djbpython		wlan0 is listed as the logical name using lshw -C network
