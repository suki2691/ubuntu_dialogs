2011-05-05T22:56:00.000Z	fatal_ERROR777		hello to everyone, I have got a problem with a lock screen. If I leave my laptop in that state for a long time, I can's see the window where I suppose to type in my pass to unlock so I am forced to turn it off by a power button. Any ideas of fixing it? Running Ubuntu 11.04.
