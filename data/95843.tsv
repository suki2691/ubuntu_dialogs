2010-11-23T10:08:00.000Z	Datz	jimjankins	I'd assume so. Just ask
2010-11-23T10:12:00.000Z	Datz	jimjankins	there should be some indication of the field that hasn't been completed, or completeed incorrectly
2010-11-23T10:13:00.000Z	Datz	jimjankins	you may have used some illegal characters, or your password isn't stong enough, check for things like that
