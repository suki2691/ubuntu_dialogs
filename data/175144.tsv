2006-07-29T12:35:00.000Z	section31		can someone explain why i have to run executables using './'..i know that means current working directory but why doesn't it work otherwise
2006-07-29T12:36:00.000Z	dmsantam	section31	you have to tell the shell where the executable is
2006-07-29T12:36:00.000Z	dmsantam	section31	it doesn't assume that not telling it means that its right "here"
2006-07-29T12:36:00.000Z	dmsantam	section31	you're welcome :)
