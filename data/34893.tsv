2010-05-06T12:33:00.000Z	sveinse		Anyone knows how I can make Empathy sign in automatically? I always have to select the envelope icon and then chat to make it sign in. (I'm running lucid)

2010-05-06T12:37:00.000Z	sveinse	red2kic	I can add it to the Startup apps. However, the envelope icon on the top panel, what is that and does it have some kind of config?
