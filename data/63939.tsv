2010-08-03T10:43:00.000Z	optimus55		Just installed kubuntu but for some reason already banned form #kubuntu.... anyone here knows how to install themes in kubuntu 10.04? all the tutorials i found have different options available than what i see.

2010-08-03T10:43:00.000Z	xangua		that's what i do in gnome, no idea how to in kde
2010-08-03T10:45:00.000Z	optimus55	xangua	no idea. i said i just installed it today so i'd never been to that chan before. but my real question is i've downloaded the plasma theme, but theres no where that says "add new theme" at least not in the latest kubuntu
