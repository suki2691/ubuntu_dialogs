2009-01-20T23:30:00.000Z	gerob		hey all, finally got my video card working and now Im wondering how I get the nicer themes on my desktop like some of the Compiz or Emerald ones
2009-01-20T23:31:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gerob	You can just go to System -> Preferences -> Appearance and then desktop effects I think... For more modular control, I suggest doing sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
2009-01-20T23:34:00.000Z	gerob	ASULutzy	Thanks, I will let you know if I have any more questions regarding the setup.
2009-01-20T23:36:00.000Z	gerob	ASULutzy	 How do I get the icon bar along the bottom like I have seen in some UI's?  I can't find an option for it in the settings manager
