2009-02-26T09:09:00.000Z	squarepeg		having trouble opening synaptic package manager. error message says I should use 'dpkg --configure -a' . I tried that in the terminal. It said I need to be super user. now what?
2009-02-26T09:10:00.000Z	prince_jammys	squarepeg	put 'sudo' before the dpkg command
2009-02-26T09:12:00.000Z	squarepeg	prince_jammys	thanks a lot
2009-02-26T09:13:00.000Z	prince_jammys	squarepeg	welcome.  sudo allows you to run commands as superuser.
