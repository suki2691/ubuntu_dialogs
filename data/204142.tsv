2005-12-29T09:02:00.000Z	nemik		so when i try to open some wmv files, i get a warning saying it could be a security risk, but i can open them with the "open with" application, is this Xine spitting this error?
2005-12-29T09:02:00.000Z	ElitePete	nemik	no.
2005-12-29T09:02:00.000Z	nemik	ElitePete	is there a way to get rid of the warning so it will play just when i double-click?
2005-12-29T09:03:00.000Z	ElitePete	nemik	right click the file "open with"
