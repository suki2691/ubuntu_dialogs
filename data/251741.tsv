2007-07-24T16:19:00.000Z	YANP		Hi, can someone help me really quick?  I am trying to make a copy of Ubuntu and it promps me with this message: It appears that the disc, when created, will contain a single disc image file.  Do you want to create a disc from the contents of the image or with the image file inside?
