2007-02-14T07:32:00.000Z	trainer_		I'm trying to install from the live cd, and the partitioner hangs. my /etc/fstab has only unionfs and tmpfs, is it not detecting my hd?
2007-02-14T07:33:00.000Z	holycow	trainer_	yeah that is very common indeed sir.  its buggy.  install ubuntu using the alternate iso ... it uses d-i the terrific text based installer
2007-02-14T07:34:00.000Z	trainer_	holycow	alternate iso? i have to burn a new cd?
2007-02-14T07:35:00.000Z	holycow	trainer_	its a separate cd yes.  just note that the live cd is brand new idea for installing an os, ubuntu was the first to do it, but the modifications made to the partitioner are very buggy and i helkp people with your situation a lot.  so yeah try the alternate for now.  the live cd will improve.
