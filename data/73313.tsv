2010-03-06T07:26:00.000Z	J13R		is this the channel about windows support?
2010-03-06T07:27:00.000Z	J13R		No no no, in ##windows they are talking about ubuntu and linux all the time, so I thought maybe this is the right place
2010-03-06T07:28:00.000Z	dj_segfault	J13R	That's because in ##windows. they're jealous of #ubuntu
