2009-03-11T14:11:00.000Z	milligan		I have set up my nic in /etc/network/interfaces .. but it seems that dhcpclient or something else is running, causing me to get a dhcp ip. How can I disable the client ? I killed NetworkManager, but it STILL got the dhcp ip.

2009-03-11T14:14:00.000Z	milligan	ziroday	because of the mask, or a lookup on me here? :)
2009-03-11T14:14:00.000Z	ziroday	milligan	lookup on you here
