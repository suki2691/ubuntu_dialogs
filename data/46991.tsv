2009-12-15T17:47:00.000Z	Emanon	SuperUser|David	there are options in the libnotify plugin config menu in plugins menu of pidgin
2009-12-15T17:48:00.000Z	Emanon		yea i did that command you offered ill log out later and see if it worked its not critical just petty annoyance
2009-12-15T17:48:00.000Z	SuperUser|David	Emanon	yes, but that is not what i am looking for. i was looking for something like changing the background color of the popup or something like that
