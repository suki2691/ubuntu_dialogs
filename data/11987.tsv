2012-02-22T18:26:00.000Z	somsip		Can I expect any problems with 11.10 and a 87-key 'tenkeyless' keyboard. Only every used 104-key but it seems prudent to ask...
2012-02-22T18:27:00.000Z	jrib	somsip	I don't see why (I use a tenkeyless keyboard albeit not with unity)
2012-02-22T18:27:00.000Z	somsip	jrib	no unity here either. TVM
2012-09-25T05:37:00.000Z	somsip	jrib	does VNC server suport RDP connections?
