2008-06-23T18:04:00.000Z	jrotten		hey all...linux noob here with a question about installing packages...
2008-06-23T18:05:00.000Z	jrotten		I installed gnus yesterday but I am still confused on why some show up in the apps tab and some not..I cannot find gnus to run it.
2008-06-23T18:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	jrotten	emma gnus runs inside emacs
2008-06-23T18:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	jrotten	open emacs and do  "M-x gnus" (usually Alt + x gnus enter)
