2006-10-20T09:59:00.000Z	teledyn	NickGarvey	there's the opensource nv driver, or the closed-source nvidia one
2006-10-20T09:59:00.000Z	teledyn	NickGarvey	read about supported cards of nv driver at xorg website
2006-10-20T10:00:00.000Z	teledyn	NickGarvey	right now there's a nasty exploit for the nvidia driver
