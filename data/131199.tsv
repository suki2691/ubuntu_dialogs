2007-06-15T07:13:00.000Z	__mikem	sgrove_	try going into a root shell, if it boots, install binary video drivers
2007-06-15T07:17:00.000Z	sgrove_	__mikem	would I go into root shell by booting froma  livecd? or is there any other way?
2007-06-15T07:17:00.000Z	__mikem	sgrove_	no, you would select recovery mode form the boot screen
