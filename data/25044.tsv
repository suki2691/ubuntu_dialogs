2010-10-01T04:00:00.000Z	bivo	TeLe{K}	I get to where I can pick the os, if I pick UNR it restarts the machine. If I pick XP it boots normally
2010-10-01T04:01:00.000Z	TeLe{K}	bivo	i dont know wubi but i once read about how to recover data from wubi partitions, have to mount your windows partitions and then mount -o loop your wubi disk,  but i recommend google it
