2012-03-13T05:48:00.000Z	danny		i have both win 7 and ubuntu installed already
2012-03-13T05:48:00.000Z	hydrox24	danny	no.
2012-03-13T05:50:00.000Z	danny	hydrox24	ok dang now i dont know to much about virtual machines but i have a windows 7 key on the back of my computer can i use that key if i ran win 7 virtualy from ubuntu ? or will i have to buy a whole new key ?
