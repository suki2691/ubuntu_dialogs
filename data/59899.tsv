2009-04-21T00:05:00.000Z	rtk126		Hello everyone! So I'm looking to remote backup few ubuntu servers. I want a single account, but different permissions... Anyone knows a good solution?

2009-04-21T00:07:00.000Z	rtk126	Brucevdk	We have multiple divisions, so I would like divisions to use the same billing account, and if possible our master admin to see all backups, but each division to only have access to their own backups
