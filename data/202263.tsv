2008-11-26T00:32:00.000Z	Al2O3		I have Ubuntu 8.10 on CD for install, machine locks up when I try to boot of CD (had windows 2000 installed if that matters, shouldn't).  Gets thru about 40-50 seconds of install after Ubuntu main menu for install and other options.  Both cold and warm boot does same.  Also locks up on Live CD run instead of install.  Machine is Toshiba ( http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/toshiba-satellite-a105-s2141/4507-3121_7-31982426.html?tag=mncol;psum
