2005-01-29T07:31:00.000Z	willis__		just wondering how often the ubuntu servers rebuild the Packages file (i'm anxious for the new restricted-modules)
2005-01-29T07:31:00.000Z	bob2	willis__	very often, the big lag is having them built and uploaded
2005-01-29T07:32:00.000Z	bob2		(often = every hour, iirc)
2005-01-29T07:32:00.000Z	willis__	bob2	thanks
