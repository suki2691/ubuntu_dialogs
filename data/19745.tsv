I installed it, and it's worked fine, but now only my IRC client (that's set to load on startup) appears when I boot my machine, and nothing like the menu, topbar, close buttons etc. are appearing [although, a full screen IRC client is quite cool]

2011-05-29T17:30:00.000Z	Zuzak	bullgard4	thanks. I'm curious as to where everything's gone, it's as if it doesn't load on startup at all
