2008-11-23T21:56:00.000Z	Jagged	UnknownUSSR	Yes.  Although a separate "/boot" isn't entirely necessary
2008-11-23T21:57:00.000Z	Jagged	UnknownUSSR	Do you currently have your hard drive partitioned with a functioning windows installation?
2008-11-23T21:58:00.000Z	Jagged	UnknownUSSR	No, just checking.  If you install Windows after installing linux, windows will overwrite the MBR with its own bootloader
