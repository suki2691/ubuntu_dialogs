2012-01-24T03:11:00.000Z	yumbo_	littlebit	the full KDE Desktop Environment is called "kde-full"
2012-01-24T03:12:00.000Z	yumbo_	littlebit	I should give kde-desktop a try first and do kde-full if you like it
2012-01-24T03:13:00.000Z	yumbo_	littlebit	oh, I think it's called "kde-standard" for Ubuntu 11.10 actually
