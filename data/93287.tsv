2010-12-29T00:00:00.000Z	herghost		I have been experimenting with multiple screens on 10.10 and things have not gone well.  nvidia-settings only shows one device (laptop screen) but the system appears to still think it has 2 screens.  It used to mean playing around with xorg.conf, but this doesn't appear to be used now.  Any pointers for how to resolve this?

2010-12-29T00:01:00.000Z	herghost	Dr_Willis	 it is now totally off and disconnected.  I have since restarted x and rebooted too.  when I take a screenshot, it still shows as having a screen there (a black area where the screen was)
