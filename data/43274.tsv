2012-11-09T02:11:00.000Z	a7i3n		Installed 12.10 fresh and then installed the driver with the same result.
2012-11-09T02:13:00.000Z	Galvatron	a7i3n	Have you tried Catalyst 12.11?
2012-11-09T02:15:00.000Z	Galvatron	a7i3n	Maybe let 12.10 mature and for the time being use 12.04. The differences are really minuscule.
