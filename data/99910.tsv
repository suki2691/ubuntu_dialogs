2008-02-20T01:03:00.000Z	conb123		Ok ill have a look
2008-02-20T01:03:00.000Z	Gregmond	conb123	I am no expert, but have you tried to boot the cd with no hdd connected to see if it works ?
2008-02-20T01:07:00.000Z	Gregmond	conb123	I think so, but not sure. it should just ignore the hdd if it cant see one.
