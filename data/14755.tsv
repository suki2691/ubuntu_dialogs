2011-07-12T12:06:00.000Z	AFD		Any ideas why an SSH session would crash in Terminal when I'm using a VPN? (the whole conenction seems slow)
2011-07-12T12:07:00.000Z	AFD		Is there a speed requirement to keep the session open?
2011-07-12T12:07:00.000Z	Tm_T	AFD	not more than the ping timeout limit
2011-07-12T12:08:00.000Z	AFD	Tm_T	ok
