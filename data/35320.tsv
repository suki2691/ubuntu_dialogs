2011-03-06T10:43:00.000Z	CheBuzz_Home		I have an Asus computer with HDMI out connected to a Samsung TV.  I have connected the cable, and enabled the display (that was auto-detected) in the nVidia control panel, but the TV is telling me that the source is not connected.  Any chance anybody has encountered a similar situation, and found a solution?

2011-03-06T10:47:00.000Z	CheBuzz_Home	ActionParsnip	Yes.  The TV is fully capable of 1080p, but I have also tried 720.
