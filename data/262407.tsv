2004-10-21T16:25:00.000Z	Blissex	lml	it has a number of ready-made MythTV packages. Just install them.
2004-10-21T16:26:00.000Z	Blissex	lml	to manage packages use 'synaptic' all the time, it lists what is available, and you can search for packages etc.
2004-10-21T16:31:00.000Z	lml	Blissex	I did see the packages in universe for a couple of weeks ago, but I cannot find them any more.
