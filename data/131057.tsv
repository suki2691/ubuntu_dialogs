2009-10-30T07:04:00.000Z	FFEMTcJ	Xgates	yes,
2009-10-30T07:05:00.000Z	Xgates	FFEMTcJ	this url ---> http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-to-Fix-VirtualBox-USB-Support-111715.shtml says that when you look at the groups you'll find a group entry there called 'vboxusers' but I see none. I know I can just add the name, but I'm wondering does any VB pkg set this up?
2009-10-30T07:09:00.000Z	Xgates	FFEMTcJ	did you check that URL?
