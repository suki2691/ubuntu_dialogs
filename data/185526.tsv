2006-05-20T11:29:00.000Z	AngryElf1		i can get to a prompt.....how do i restart the installer?
2006-05-20T11:29:00.000Z	AngryElf1		and what is SUM?
2006-05-20T11:30:00.000Z	CyaniCs|Testing	AngryElf1	- I can't remember what the install process name is, but you should only need to restart the defunct process, not the whole installer.
2006-05-20T11:31:00.000Z	AngryElf1	CyaniCs|Testing	well i think the problem may be network connectivity, but i can't test it from the prompt because ping isn't installed....do you know another way?
