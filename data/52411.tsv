2009-07-19T00:47:00.000Z	skypilot	DopeGhoti	i did this: http://www.pulseaudio.org/wiki/FAQ#IhaveasurroundsoundcardbutPulseAudiousesjustthefrontspeakers  then restarted pulseaudio. It gave me an error, but seems to be working anyway.. i also did some stuff from this thread:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=770028  (the 6th post)
