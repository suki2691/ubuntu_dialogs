2008-02-25T02:04:00.000Z	solid_liq	grayhane	yes
2008-02-25T02:05:00.000Z	grayhane	solid_liq	I do not seem to be able to do so, the partition comes up on the desktop but I cannot write to it.
2008-02-25T02:06:00.000Z	solid_liq	grayhane	I don't think writing is enabled by default, google for a guide on enabling writing
