2011-01-05T04:58:00.000Z	philip__		I want to install maverick onto a RAID1 array. I followed the Software RAID guide, but after creating the array, the installer says there's no / partition to install to. Any ideas?

2011-01-05T05:02:00.000Z	philip__	trench	the installer says it made the MD array. I used it to make the array (alternate CD)
2011-01-05T05:03:00.000Z	philip__	trench	yes. I did it with both the alternate CD's installer, and the desktop CD's Disk utility to make the RAID array. No cigar
