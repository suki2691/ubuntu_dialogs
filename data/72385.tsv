2009-10-04T22:08:00.000Z	JonNeon		so, im a 1st time 1st day ubuntu user :-/. whenever i surf the net, especially on pages with text and pics, the text is really small, and the page runs quite glitchy, if I increase the size of the text, the pics get really pixelated the page runs worse...what am i doing wrong?
2009-10-04T22:09:00.000Z	dougl	JonNeon	wat kind of video card do you have?
2009-10-04T22:10:00.000Z	dougl	JonNeon	you see the nvidia splash screen when your computer starts?
2009-10-04T22:12:00.000Z	dougl	JonNeon	just because your video works does not mean the Nvidia drivers are installed
