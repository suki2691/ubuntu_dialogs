2009-08-20T06:39:00.000Z	cwillu	ConstantineXVI	generally if you're using lua, the things that make programming really complicated have already been taken care of
2009-08-20T06:39:00.000Z	cwillu	ConstantineXVI	it's generally quite straightforward
2009-08-20T06:39:00.000Z	ConstantineXVI	cwillu	good; shouldn't be too hard for him
