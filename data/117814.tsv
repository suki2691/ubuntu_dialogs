2007-10-31T02:08:00.000Z	mutable		Hello all, I've put this line to my script: "export MYVAR=varvar". However after running this script the variable MYVAR is still undefined ?
2007-10-31T02:09:00.000Z	Ademan	mutable	what script? something like that should probably go in ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc
2007-10-31T02:09:00.000Z	mutable	Ademan	yes, but i want to set this variable on demand
2007-10-31T02:10:00.000Z	Ademan	mutable	considering it's a single line and variable it couldn't be that bad to type it could it? (also #bash is pretty knowledgable about this kind of stuff)
