2011-04-30T06:29:00.000Z	aj00200	plummerb	the main issue is that some people end up using Ubuntu Classic (Gnome) rather than the new display (Unity)
2011-04-30T06:31:00.000Z	aj00200	plummerb	no. I'm saying that this new interface doesn't work for some people and they have to revert to the older one
