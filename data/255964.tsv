2004-12-07T12:19:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	sparehead1	if you're installing it outside of the packaging system, use /usr/local as the stem name then make symlinks of the executable to /usr/local/bin
2004-12-07T12:23:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	sparehead1	well, since that is *within* the packaging system disregard my /usr/local advice. It should have put acroread somewhere in your path.
