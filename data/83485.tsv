2008-09-02T01:39:00.000Z	kavelot		which ubuntu service is responsible for detecting when a network cable is plugged and calling ifup?
2008-09-02T01:39:00.000Z	FreshUbuntuNoob	kavelot	It is not present by default, but "ifplugd" fulfills that purpose...
2008-09-02T01:40:00.000Z	kavelot	FreshUbuntuNoob	hm, but ubuntu auto-detects, by default, when a network cable is plugged, doesn't it?
2008-09-02T01:40:00.000Z	FreshUbuntuNoob	kavelot	AFAIK, it never did to me... and it doesn't...
