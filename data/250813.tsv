2007-06-30T07:13:00.000Z	gianmarco		how can i do tasks automatically with files?
2007-06-30T07:14:00.000Z	AzMoo	gianmarco	what do you mean? Like schedule file operations at particular times?
2007-06-30T07:18:00.000Z	AzMoo	gianmarco	the only way I can think of is to write a script that moves the files and schedule it with cron or gnome-schedule
