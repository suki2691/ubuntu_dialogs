2008-09-06T14:26:00.000Z	LordMetroid		I am trying to compile Anjuta and it says, Package requirements (gtk+-2.0 >= 2.10.0), I can't find any gtk-dev package, what am I suppose to install?
2008-09-06T14:28:00.000Z	Polygon89	LordMetroid	might want to try xubuntu or get a new laptop O.o
2008-09-06T14:28:00.000Z	LordMetroid	Polygon89	I have tried em and it didn't work either, new laptop... can't afford it
2008-09-06T14:29:00.000Z	Polygon89	LordMetroid	then do a server install and use fluxbox or something
