2011-01-04T12:55:00.000Z	ubuntu-newb		when setting up ubuntu partitions I currently have a 500gb drive with winxp using the first 125gb trying to figure out if the /boot partition is to be primary or logical?
2011-01-04T12:57:00.000Z	loxs	ubuntu-newb	it doesn't matter. Just have in mind that you can only have 4 primary partitions
2011-01-04T13:06:00.000Z	ubuntu-newb	loxs	ok what size should the boot partition be?
2011-01-04T13:07:00.000Z	loxs	ubuntu-newb	not more than 1 gigabyte. And if you really are new to ubuntu/linux, I'd suggest not using one.
