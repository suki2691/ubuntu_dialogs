2007-04-30T08:17:00.000Z	ad0le		no, I dont know the executable name
2007-04-30T08:19:00.000Z	ad0le		Im at work, I can ssh into my home machine but it looks like the RDesktop daemon stopped running, I just need to know how to start it back up :)
2007-04-30T08:20:00.000Z	Hobbsee	ad0le	i'd try running "rdesktop" as the executable - or at least trying that, then hitting tab
