2012-01-28T01:46:00.000Z	dlentz	tnk1	did you try changing wallpaper (and back)?
2012-01-28T01:48:00.000Z	tnk1	dlentz	yes it just stays there. i'm thinking it's one of the defunt processes running inside google chrome, actually, because it was a right click on a link that put the window there (it was the grey background for right click selections on a page), then the writing and everything else disapperaed when i clicked away, but the background grey box remained....
2012-01-28T01:49:00.000Z	tnk1	dlentz	so I wonder if there's a way besides just restarting chrome..
