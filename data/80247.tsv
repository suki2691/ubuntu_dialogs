2010-06-20T14:19:00.000Z	Walex	wgwinn	'sudo /sbin/ethtool eth0'
2010-06-20T14:20:00.000Z	wgwinn	Walex	ethtool not installed. apt-get.. not very useful w/o net.
2010-06-20T14:21:00.000Z	wgwinn	Walex	i did in fact grab the ethtool source via thumbdrive, didnt see a compiled version on ubuntu's site, but.. no compiler.
