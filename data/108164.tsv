2007-12-29T08:13:00.000Z	initx	moDumass	wait 60 years for the OS, first.. seriously, if it's a deb package you should just be able to double-click in file manager, it's that easy now
2007-12-29T08:14:00.000Z	initx	moDumass	or dpkg -i filename.deb
2007-12-29T08:14:00.000Z	moDumass	initx	yeh but i found using the one in synaptic just screwed up my system
