2012-01-08T20:58:00.000Z	pip__		Hello, how can I get network manager up & running on a minimal install?  I'm using oneiric minimal.  At the moment I mainly use 2 wireless networks so I can easily edit /etc/network/interfaces.  I'd like to have NM working just in case I need to use a "new" wireless network
