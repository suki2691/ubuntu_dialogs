2008-03-10T06:26:00.000Z	snake	Agent_bob	i have only ubuntu repos. this problem occured since the time i tried to install something else. i removed those repos but the problem remained
2008-03-10T06:30:00.000Z	snake	Agent_bob	i did something else. i added the repository that had qmail. i removed qmail and some other packages that were there and i removed the repository again. now everything is ok. thank you
