2012-06-26T07:40:00.000Z	AndChat223345		I have a little problem about priviledge.Provided I have two linux distros installed on one pc, a file created and owned by a user in linux A,would the permissions and ownership of that file 'transfered' to the user in linux B that shared the same uid with the oringinal user in linux A?  hope I didn't post question in wrong place..
