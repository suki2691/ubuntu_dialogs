2011-10-17T14:10:00.000Z	joa__		hey, i try to start multiple terminal instances from unity launcher but cannot get it to work. i heard middle-click but does not do the job
2011-10-17T14:11:00.000Z	jatt	joa__	you should create a new shortcut in the toolbar and then you can click on it
2011-10-17T14:11:00.000Z	jatt	joa__	the default behaviour is to have only _one_ terminal instance
2011-10-17T14:12:00.000Z	joa__	jatt	tried that, with "keep in launcher" still no lock
