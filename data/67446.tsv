2009-02-05T16:08:00.000Z	ziroday`	prometheus77	its probably best asked in #kubuntu :)
2009-02-05T16:09:00.000Z	prometheus77	ziroday`	maybe, but i am using gnome and some of qt based apps
2009-02-05T16:10:00.000Z	ziroday`	prometheus77	sure, but the great folks in #kubuntu know most about qt* related stuff :)
