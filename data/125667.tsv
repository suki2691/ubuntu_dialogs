2007-09-13T15:14:00.000Z	dgjones	heartsblood	either nvidia-glx or nvidia-glx-new or nvidia-glx-legacy for old cards
2007-09-13T15:17:00.000Z	dgjones	heartsblood	it took me a while to get the nvidia-glx working for 3d on my laptop, seemed to be a few things in xorg that ended up manually configuring
2007-09-13T15:19:00.000Z	dgjones	heartsblood	i'll pastebin my xorg, maybe that'll give you a hint as whats not working
