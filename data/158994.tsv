2012-05-25T16:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	shape	 it would have its own grub on the usb
2012-05-25T16:11:00.000Z	shape	Dr_Willis	So if I have running Ubuntu with Grub on my PC, the Ubuntu that I install on the flashdrive, will install grub on the flash, and once I remove the flash, the second grub wil lbe gone, correct?
