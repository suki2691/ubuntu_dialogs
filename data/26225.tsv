2011-08-01T21:20:00.000Z	ratkinson		i'm running ubuntu 11.04 on a touchscreen pc. I have the touchscreen drivers working but my x is y and y is x AND calibration is off a bit. Ive tried the xinput_calibrator but is makes the mouse jump all over the place. As it is now the mouse works without jumping around but like i said calibration is off. Basicly, I need to swap axes and calibrate without using xinput_calibrator. Any ideas?
