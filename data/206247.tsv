2006-10-17T10:00:00.000Z	Falstius		I'm running dapper and have a SATA harddrive ... when I copy from that harddrive I see "DriveStatusError BadCRC" and "DriveReady SeekComplete Error" a bunch of times in /var/log/messages.  However, neither fsck nor smartctl report any problems.   Anyone have a suggestion?
