2006-04-12T16:40:00.000Z	damotor	Frogzoo	that's what I did, but I was looking for an alternative to this, because then appear a flag from one task to another when they're not really linked
2006-04-12T16:41:00.000Z	Frogzoo	damotor	they are if you think about it
2006-04-12T16:42:00.000Z	damotor	Frogzoo	yes, but not in the way you must end task1 to start task2, anyway, I believe it'll do the trick, thx
