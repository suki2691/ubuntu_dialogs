2010-10-12T18:32:00.000Z	christf		I'm new to all this, but so far I really like Ubuntu. I'm only having one issue, if anybody could help me. I've done a lot of searching and nothing seems to work. I've got a desktop running win7 and I want to access the files on that computer, but I can't seem to connect. Any ideas?
