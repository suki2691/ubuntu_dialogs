2012-09-11T15:30:00.000Z	hal		I am looking for a GUI file manager with two panels, that will allow me to browse two almost identical file systems and *visually* compare them. Thus, it will allow me to descend into usr/local/bin from usr/local/ in both /mnt/backup/daily.0/usr/local/ and /mnt/backup/daily.1/usr/local/
2012-09-11T15:31:00.000Z	hal		does anyone have any suggestions, please?
2012-09-11T15:32:00.000Z	hal		really, I want it to "lock" onto the roots of those hierarchies, at backup.0 and backup.1, and use one panel to navigate both
