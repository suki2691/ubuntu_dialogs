2005-06-15T11:50:00.000Z	cmihai		Hello. I was wondering, while installing Ubuntu with no internet connection, yet you configured the net, and it starts to look for mirrors, is there any way to stop it after that ? I've waited some 10 minutes and nothing.

2005-06-15T11:52:00.000Z	cmihai		Neeh, I was just thinking ..bad installer design :(
