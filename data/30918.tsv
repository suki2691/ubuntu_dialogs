2010-06-21T22:24:00.000Z	Buttons840		is there a package to install gnu scheme in ubuntu 10.04?
2010-06-21T22:25:00.000Z	SlidingHorn	Buttons840	do you mean the GNU Scheme interpreter?  sudo apt-get install guile-1.6
2010-06-21T22:26:00.000Z	Buttons840	SlidingHorn	probably, i think guile is what i want
