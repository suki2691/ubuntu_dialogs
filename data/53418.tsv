2009-10-16T13:42:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	stanley	With many new upcoming features in Ubuntu Koala Karmic (Release 9.10), there are many great things about Karmic! One even claims that it now can make you a sandwich (without a sudo!).  For more discussions and/or supports, see #ubuntu+1

2009-10-16T13:44:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	stanley	Both will work.  It's all up to you.
