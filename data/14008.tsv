2011-09-18T02:42:00.000Z	FJAA-1983		Is it possible to Sync an Ipod 6th Gen with Ubuntu yet? I've been searching the net for an answer but I can't find something conclusive.

2011-09-18T02:43:00.000Z	FJAA-1983	Polah	Banshee didn't work for me. I'm able to "copy" the files to the IPOD, but then I am not able to play them. They do not appear on the playlist.
2011-09-18T02:44:00.000Z	FJAA-1983	Polah	Also read that our good friends in Macintosh killed the "friendly" ipod interface. I just wanted to know if it was corrected yet.
