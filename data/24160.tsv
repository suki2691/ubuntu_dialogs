2011-07-05T09:44:00.000Z	KM0201	Austin_	are you trying to remove your old ubuntu install, and clean install over it, or what?
2011-07-05T09:49:00.000Z	KM0201	Austin_	have you considered just installing like a normal person, and partitioning your internal drive and setting up a dual boot?
2011-07-05T09:54:00.000Z	KM0201	Austin_	and what options did you say it gave you?
