2010-06-17T04:40:00.000Z	albinsson		But do any one know how to solve the problem were ubuntu can't find a autorun program in a CD/DVD (for example, asus installation disk for asus probe and other essential programs)? If no one has the time or knowlage, please send me to a place who can aid me. (I have scanned the FAQ and internet for help but in vain).
