2011-08-07T23:35:00.000Z	cck4		good afternoon everyone. and sorry for broken English. (via google translate).
2011-08-07T23:35:00.000Z	cck4		Using Ubuntu 11.04 in Virtualbox: With the Guest Additions 4.0.8 the resolution 1920x1010x24 worked properly in tty. After I upgrade to the Guest Additions 4.1.0 the tty were with black screen or with a resolution of 480x320x8 (as shown in http://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=43549)
2011-08-07T23:35:00.000Z	cck4		Using vbetool vbemode September 865 (linked mode 1920x1010x24 resolution) resolves the issue. but switched to tty7 and then back to the tty [1 ... 6] back to black screen or the resolution of 480x320x8 (depending on the previous state of the tty)
