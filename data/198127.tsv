2006-02-24T14:40:00.000Z	unix_infidel		anyone with any idea bout my problem here, after i started using startx instead of kdm to log into fluxbox i've gotten somethings to work yet all my fonts in various other apps in fluxbox arent anti-alias....
2006-02-24T14:40:00.000Z	unix_infidel		i cant seem to figure ot why this is true.
2006-02-24T14:42:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	unix_infidel	you can try asking in #fluxbox and #fluxbox-chitchat if you cant find help in here
2006-02-24T14:42:00.000Z	unix_infidel	OmegaAlpha	already tried.
