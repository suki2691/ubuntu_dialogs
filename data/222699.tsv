2008-02-08T22:19:00.000Z	ToxMox		Hello...I'm somewhat of a linux noob and I have a question that I can't seem to find because I'm not sure how to search the net for it...
2008-02-08T22:19:00.000Z	ToxMox		Is there a way to make an ubuntu server respond to network request as several machine names?  I'd like to assign 3 or 4 machine names to one box

2008-02-08T22:21:00.000Z	mneptok	ToxMox	it's still a function of DNS
