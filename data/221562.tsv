2005-10-28T15:35:00.000Z	vbgunz		Anyone here know why my dvd's just quit? Totem just exits and I thought it was a totem problem *but* after installing gxine and trying it, it too quits unexpectedly... no prompts or warnings or restarts... they just quit :( Anyone know what might be wrong?

Although I am trying to go stock, I am resorting to 3rd party apps. *but* in this case it doesn't seem to be Totem that sucks or just exists unexpectedly... After installing gxine, it too quits without warning... Anyone know?
