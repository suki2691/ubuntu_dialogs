2011-07-19T17:40:00.000Z	balooo		Hi.  I'm currently using Ubuntu but i'm on a windows network that I do not manage.  I'm having problems pinging any other machines (windows or linux) by their hostname, and similarly they cannot ping my machine by my hostname.  Is there something I "need to"or can do to make my ubuntu machine compliant with however windows networks are managed?

2011-07-19T17:41:00.000Z	balooo	dr_willis	pinging the ip works.  But out ips are not static.
