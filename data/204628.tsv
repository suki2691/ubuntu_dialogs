2006-01-25T15:27:00.000Z	Khisanth		hmm what do I need to get the man pages for things like strftime
2006-01-25T15:27:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Khisanth	man strftime   if that doesnt work there may not be a man page on it
2006-01-25T15:29:00.000Z	Khisanth	gnomefreak	I know quite well how to access a manpage, I meant the package it would be in
