2012-04-22T03:32:00.000Z	aggrav8d	boxbeatsy	- what are you searching for?
2012-04-22T03:33:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	aggrav8d	each row has a 'keyword' column and i'ms earching for the ten closest matches to the keyword along with the corresponding data
2012-04-22T03:33:00.000Z	aggrav8d	boxbeatsy	- I'd sort them alphabetically.
