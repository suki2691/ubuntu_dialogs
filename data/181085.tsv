2007-03-29T16:47:00.000Z	iMilad		Hi everybody,is there anyway to make gnome show only part of file names? because it always shows complete filenames and it messes my icons
2007-03-29T16:49:00.000Z	iMilad		b14ck... i'm looking for a better soloution. windows puts ... for files with long names. is it possible to do the same in linux?
