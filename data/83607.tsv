2008-10-14T10:55:00.000Z	Oxygenfad		Hey guys. I burned a CD in ubuntu. I am trying to copy thw files onto a windows machine. All is well but the names are bonkers. How do I get the real names back ?

2008-10-14T10:57:00.000Z	Srle	Oxygenfad	- it's already burned
2008-10-14T10:58:00.000Z	Srle	Oxygenfad	- burn another with options told above
