2011-04-10T10:34:00.000Z	Fuzy		well i looked and it dosent want to mount the dam thing and its frustrating
2011-04-10T10:35:00.000Z	ohsix	Fuzy	you can't format a drive thats mounted anyways, but yea, use the disk utility like omac says; if your drive is damaged and you want to figure out how to make it mount, that's another question
