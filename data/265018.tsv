2004-10-01T05:01:00.000Z	trey_	ondrej	lvm2 allows for resizing partitions 'on the fly' ... I would like to see that be incorporated into the default partitioning set up... perhaps adding gpart to the mix also...
2004-10-01T05:02:00.000Z	trey_	ondrej	can't say as though I care too much about ntfs though...
2004-10-01T05:03:00.000Z	ondrej	trey_	but if you care for users, you should care how they could install Ubuntu on their notebook.  And many notebook came with preinstalled WXP on NTFS (f.e. mine)
