2009-06-07T05:52:00.000Z	fccf	Barridus	goto system>preferences>main menu - you should be able to do what you need from there
2009-06-07T06:08:00.000Z	Barridus	fccf	i edited the menu, however every time i click on the evolution icon i made, it launches in terminal
2009-06-07T06:10:00.000Z	fccf	Barridus	go into menu editor ... right click on evolution>properties ... make sure it says applications
2009-06-07T06:11:00.000Z	Barridus	fccf	i figured it out, thanks :)
