2011-03-01T15:46:00.000Z	jnjnjn		can i run nautilus from a mounted filesystem, and how?
2011-03-01T15:46:00.000Z	karla	jnjnjn	your inquiry is a little ambiguous
2011-03-01T15:47:00.000Z	jnjnjn	karla	i have mounted my filesystem through a livecd, and i would like to revert a thing i did with nautilus before my comp crashed
2011-03-01T15:48:00.000Z	jnjnjn	karla	i mounted a ftp drive through nautilus and now, when i boot, my computer cant mount my filesystem
