2010-05-09T21:10:00.000Z	wildc4rd		I have done it once before for 9.04, but can't recall how
2010-05-09T21:10:00.000Z	wildc4rd		I remember having to 'make' it or something
2010-05-09T21:11:00.000Z	Radio-l	wildc4rd	there should be a doc that tells you, but generally it's just make, then make install
