2006-04-22T13:18:00.000Z	starshine		I have a dell 370 that used to be happy on ubuntu live CD 5.10 but now when I try it cannot find the CD bay
2006-04-22T13:18:00.000Z	starshine		the machine has not been opened by anyone so I'm stumped what could have happened?
2006-04-22T13:18:00.000Z	starshine		It *has* had a new OS put on the hard disk, not that live CD should care...
2006-04-22T13:19:00.000Z	green_earz	starshine	check the bios for the boot order may be ?
