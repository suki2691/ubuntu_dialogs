2012-06-21T07:01:00.000Z	arimail	Mandalord	I'm getting a HDIO_GET_IDENTITY failed for /dev/sdb: Invalid argument And i'm trying to use edit parameters in Grub to find my disk. It's a Ubuntu intall on a USB external hdd disk. But I don't figure out what do change/do to be able to boot my ubuntu. Could someone please help me?
2012-06-21T07:18:00.000Z	arimail	Mandalord	Hi. It says i could run some commands to mount the hdd manually. But all of these commands returns "unknown command"
