2012-05-16T03:33:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander_	muelli	thanks, I thought to repeat it once in case someone missed it, and my question is: when he is so careless about using the internet (like he uses Internet Explorer and doesn't think about safety concerns), I think: can something spread across the router to my PC with the windows 7 and then compromise the whole system, including the ubuntu 12 part
2012-05-16T03:57:00.000Z	muelli	Lunar_Lander_	sorry. That's an odd question. If you have the hardware and don't know the answer, just try it yourself.
2012-05-16T03:59:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander_	muelli	ah OK; I mean I read what I could find by searching "Canon Pixma Ubuntu" on google and it seemed to be a really difficult process that doesn't work every time
