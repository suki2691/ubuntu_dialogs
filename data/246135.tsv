2005-03-29T11:42:00.000Z	HillTop		Thanks DarthFrog.   I'm checking out Warty -- learning. And in April I'll upgrade.  I read that upgrades to Hoary while in preview might be risky.  I did do an total refresh of the system today, so it up to date Warty.  Why would Firefox Hoary be better than current Warty Firefox?
2005-03-29T11:44:00.000Z	Myrtti	HillTop	because hoary firefox is 1.0.1 and warty firefox is 0.9.3
2005-03-29T11:45:00.000Z	HillTop	DarthFrog	 If I update to Hoary, will the extra programs I installed: Nvu, Acrobat Reader, etc. be OK or will their library connections be broken? :/    Oh!! Thanks Myrtti, that would explain that. :)
2005-03-29T11:47:00.000Z	Myrtti	HillTop	don't know about that
