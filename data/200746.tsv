2006-01-16T11:41:00.000Z	Joonior	zdux0012	ok that would be cool
2006-01-16T11:42:00.000Z	Joonior	zdux0012	at the moment the dhcp doesn't work, so i've tried setting it up myself, setting the ip to 10.0.0.20 with the netmask on 255.0.0.0 (or whatever the default is) and i put the gateway as 10.0.0.138 (the ip of my modem)
