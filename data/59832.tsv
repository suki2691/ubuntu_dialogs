2009-10-07T23:55:00.000Z	Ahlee		when did aptitude replace apt-get/apt-cache?
2009-10-07T23:56:00.000Z	Gnea	Ahlee	it didn't. they're both available.
2009-10-07T23:56:00.000Z	Ahlee	Gnea	I know, but I never see people reference apt-cache/apt-get, everybody defaults to aptitude now it seems
2009-10-07T23:56:00.000Z	Gnea	Ahlee	then you aren't around much
