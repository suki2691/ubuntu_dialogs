2008-05-09T12:56:00.000Z	panesar		is there a way to run windows games(like nfs, max payne etc.) on ubuntu?
2008-05-09T12:57:00.000Z	panesar		what about running .exe apps like autocad, coreldraw, etc.?
2008-05-09T12:57:00.000Z	fde	panesar	yes... that is sort of the point of wine... although some .exe's on Linux are for Mono.
2008-05-09T12:58:00.000Z	fde	panesar	certainly autocad will work... I never looked for coreldraw .
