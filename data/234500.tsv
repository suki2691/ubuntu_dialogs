2006-05-21T16:53:00.000Z	soonindallas		hello.  I am looking for a tutorial on how to apply a patch to a package source.  astonishingly there is little info about this in the wiki. can anyone refer me to a howto ?

2006-05-21T05:02:00.000Z	dooglus	soonindallas	understand the -p flag and you're set to go
