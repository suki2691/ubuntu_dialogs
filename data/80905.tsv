2008-10-08T22:11:00.000Z	Zappza		I get this error message when booting Xubuntu from my memory stick "Error 25 - Disk Read error". The bootloader has configured it self to boot from hd(2,0).
2008-10-08T22:11:00.000Z	Zappza		Anybody have a clue how to solve it?

2008-10-08T22:30:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Zappza	let us know if that fixed it
