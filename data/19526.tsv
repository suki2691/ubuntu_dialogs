2011-03-01T04:27:00.000Z	Starminn	ghostnik11	It's an unofficial channel, but that's where everybody goes for Windows help.
2011-03-01T04:30:00.000Z	Starminn	ghostnik11	Well although most people don't mind helping out if they know off the tops of their heads and it's kind of slow like it is right now, that's not what this channel is for, so we always redirect to ##windows. :) Sorry.
