2005-12-22T09:56:00.000Z	beelzebub1987		don't we all..
2005-12-22T09:56:00.000Z	void^	beelzebub1987	i've had little luck with RO clients and wine/cedega, but i've heard reports indicating it's possible.. somehow
2005-12-22T09:58:00.000Z	void^	beelzebub1987	heh.. when i tried i was having basic direct3d issues.. it couldn't lock a surface and would keep switching surfaces resulting in a garbled display. connecting seemed to work, but with the display problem i didn't try really attempt playing..
