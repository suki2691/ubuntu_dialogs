2012-05-16T20:11:00.000Z	qubuntu		Ubuntu always has a blank black screen whenever I "Log out". If I move the mouse it doesn't do anything, I have to force shutdown and restart. It's pretty annoying, anyone know why it does that? I don't ever log off anymore, I just shutdown. But I want to fix this problem!
