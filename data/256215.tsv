2009-04-24T17:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kethal	 KDE 4.0 now a days
2009-04-24T17:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kethal	 only recent distro ive seen that uses kde3 any more is 'slax'
2009-04-24T17:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kethal	 most of the dozen ive tried in the last 2 months dont bother with kde3  - at least not by default :)
