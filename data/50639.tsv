2010-11-17T14:39:00.000Z	DjAngo23		I installed 10.10 recently, but i setup a crypt on my whole hard drive. Is it possible to stop using the crypt ?
2010-11-17T14:39:00.000Z	chid	DjAngo23	what program did you use to crypt it? truecrypt?
2010-11-17T14:47:00.000Z	DjAngo23	chid	well when i start the computer up, i see the logo and i have to type a passphrase
2010-11-17T14:48:00.000Z	chid	DjAngo23	I'm not sure if there's a simple way (off the top of my head) to remove the encryption, but the 'obvious' way is to make a backup and repartition the home drive
