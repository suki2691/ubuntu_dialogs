2008-04-10T07:15:00.000Z	ppibburr	Elv1313	you will need a pipe
2008-04-10T07:16:00.000Z	Elv1313	ppibburr	how do i do that?
2008-04-10T07:18:00.000Z	ppibburr	Elv1313	well i code in ruby, so im sure its different :) but running the command through system to direct the the output to a file, we can be loaded is one way i now would work, ruby has IO::popen Popen3::open3 :)
