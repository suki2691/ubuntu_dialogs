2006-05-06T08:04:00.000Z	gymsmoke		anyone know which font server is installed (if any) on Ubuntu as a server ??
2006-05-06T08:04:00.000Z	BSCH	gymsmoke	you could run command "dpkg -l"
2006-05-06T08:05:00.000Z	gymsmoke	BSCH	that seems to indicate that there are no font-servers installed...
2006-05-06T08:05:00.000Z	gymsmoke	BSCH	so how does a web server know that the fonts which are here are valid and usable ?
