2010-09-01T23:51:00.000Z	roszak		Hello everyone.  I have an amd dual boot machine that is running debian and ubuntu 10 (recently updated - i think the kernel is 2.6.35).  I am on the debian side right now because I am unable to connect to the internet through a wired connection to a cable modem with ubuntu (network manager is not managing the debian side, it seems).  I would love to get the ubuntu up and running with my new internet, but at the moment it gives only 4
2010-09-01T23:51:00.000Z	roszak		04 errors.  Any ideas would be much aprreciated.
2010-09-01T23:51:00.000Z	xangua	roszak	kernel 2.6.35¿ you mean maverick¿
2010-09-01T23:55:00.000Z	roszak	xangua	i'm pretty sure it's 2.6.35 - guess that's maverick?  I would need to boot into to it to know for sure, and right now only the debian works.   i'll drop the irc connection for a sec and check.
