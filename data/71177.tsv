2010-06-18T11:56:00.000Z	thecube		does anyone know how i can stop ubuntu from booting up in "high resolution" or X mode? i want my ubuntu box to boot up like one of those old school linux/unix box w/out X and just a terminal login
2010-06-18T11:57:00.000Z	AAA	thecube	 you can always just ctrl-alt-f1 and use a VT which will look like your old school box
2010-06-18T11:58:00.000Z	thecube	AAA	thanks, is there a way not to start X? or its "native" now?
2010-06-18T12:03:00.000Z	AAA	thecube	 yes there is a way. back in the day, we used to boot to runlevel 2 for no X.  I'd need to read the docs to figure out how to do it today. sorry
