2005-12-01T09:35:00.000Z	BrownMan		Hey, does anyone want to give me a walkthrough about changing your desktop theme?
2005-12-01T09:36:00.000Z	burner	BrownMan	open "theme" and pick a new one ;)
2005-12-01T09:36:00.000Z	burner	BrownMan	download... drag 'n' drop .tar.gz file onto "themes"
2005-12-01T09:37:00.000Z	burner	BrownMan	sure is... you'll notice all themes you download from art.gnome.org are that way
