2005-09-26T10:22:00.000Z	Apotheoticsheep		Installed ubuntu a few days ago, was screwing around with the root access and users, and now I am unable to login with my other account
2005-09-26T10:22:00.000Z	Apotheoticsheep		If I had not created another account, what would/should I do?
2005-09-26T10:23:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Apotheoticsheep	root it?
