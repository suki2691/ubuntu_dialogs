2009-01-08T21:07:00.000Z	GnomeAfterAll		Does any1 here know how to get an Audigy sound card to work? :S
2009-01-08T21:09:00.000Z	milesd	GnomeAfterAll	a quick google search makes me believe it should be working already, I think the dmesg advice you've seen is good
2009-01-08T21:10:00.000Z	GnomeAfterAll	milesd	Ye, but there are so many that've got trouble with it, also, alsamixer don't recognice the card :/
