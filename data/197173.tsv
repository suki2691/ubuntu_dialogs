2010-12-29T13:12:00.000Z	dl551		Can anyone here help me figure out why I get a permission denied error with ./configure ?
2010-12-29T13:12:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	dl551	either its ownership issue or file mode issue
2010-12-29T13:14:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	dl551	for some reason I don't think they are related unless you're suspecting the technicians who serviced your laptop messed with your setup
2010-12-29T13:15:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	dl551	maybe I set user read write execute permissions first on the file
