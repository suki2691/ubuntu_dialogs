2006-07-07T09:49:00.000Z	Cabbage		Hi all. Running on Ubuntu as we speak. Have a quick question about accessing my files on my windows partitions. I have all my mp3s stored in ntfs =/.
2006-07-07T09:51:00.000Z	priich	Cabbage	do you need to write to the NTFS system aswell or is readonly enough. Are the NTFS partiotion on a separate computer/harddrive or are you dualbooting ?
2006-07-07T09:51:00.000Z	Cabbage	priich	For the time being, I just need to read.
2006-07-07T09:55:00.000Z	Cabbage	priich	 No commands. I'm trying to access it via gui.
