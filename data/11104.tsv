2011-08-04T07:12:00.000Z	marriedman624		I'm setting up dual boot of 9.10 on Vista machine.......if i set up partition of 25 GB and the rest says FREE SPACE, is it going to format the entire hard drive and delete the existing windows data?
2011-08-04T07:13:00.000Z	allandee_	marriedman624	do you know what is on your partitions otherwise?
2011-08-04T07:13:00.000Z	allandee_	marriedman624	are you confident that the 25gb partition is one that you know the contents of?
2011-08-04T07:14:00.000Z	marriedman624	allandee_	i'm trying to set up the partition, currently there is only 1 partition for the vista installation
