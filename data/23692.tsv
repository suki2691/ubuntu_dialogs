2011-03-16T16:15:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu		I have a windows partition on my install, is it possible to expand that partition and give windows a little more room?
2011-03-16T16:16:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu		or is that asking for trouble?
2011-03-16T16:16:00.000Z	ikonia	shane4ubuntu	not a problem, I suggest doing it from a liveCD so your uubntu partition is not in use
