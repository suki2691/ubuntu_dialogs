2009-09-10T17:36:00.000Z	sfyn		Hi folks
2009-09-10T17:36:00.000Z	sfyn		Got an extreme newbie question
2009-09-10T17:37:00.000Z	sfyn		How do I access my system mails? ie the mails referred to in the sentence "You have new mail" when you log in at a tty?
2009-09-10T17:37:00.000Z	nibbler_	sfyn	type mail, or maybe mailx
