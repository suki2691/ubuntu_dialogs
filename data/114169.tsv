2010-01-08T04:25:00.000Z	chriswaterguy		howdy. I'm using 8.10, and can't connect to a DSL modem via cable (Auto eth0). It tells me it's connected but I can't actually connect via browser or Skype. [I'm now using a Vista machine to connect - ack]. Network manager also shows a "DSL connection 1" option but that fails to connect at all.

2010-01-08T04:33:00.000Z	chriswaterguy	bastid_raZor	thanks. how do I get the modem to send the username/password? I've already tried both options under Wired (DSL connection 1 & Auto eth0
2010-01-08T04:48:00.000Z	chriswaterguy	bastid_raZor	& datz: I think the "DSL connection 1" was a false lead. when I click "edit connections" it said that it last connected 5 months ago, so I guess it's old and irrelevant. I deleted it. Auto eth0 still auto-connects, but I can't connect via browser or Skype.
