2008-06-06T20:24:00.000Z	[GSF]Martin	Bodsda	my x res is too short and i can't see the panel ^^, i dont really want to remove a bunch of my icons.... i know i'll make a new panel
2008-06-06T20:25:00.000Z	Bodsda	[GSF]Martin	youll have to right click on the new panel and select'add to panel'then add the 'main menu'
