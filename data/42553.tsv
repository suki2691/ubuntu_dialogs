2012-04-23T05:42:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Dawn262	i wouldn't if 133mg was meant to be 133mhz
2012-04-23T05:43:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Dawn262	if the processor is i586 use crux if i686 use arch, you WILL need to tailor your OS to get any performance out of it. if i386 use ubuntu server/debian and do it from the base up
