2009-12-10T03:23:00.000Z	Slart	lzrdking	because it offers some nice features.. and it actually work for some people out there
2009-12-10T03:25:00.000Z	Slart	lzrdking	separate volume controls for different apps.. ability to move sound from one sound card to another.. and I think the major thing is that it can be transported over network.. great for thin clients and such
2009-12-10T03:27:00.000Z	Slart	lzrdking	I don't think esound has the network features that pulseaudio has.. not sure though.. haven't used esound that much
