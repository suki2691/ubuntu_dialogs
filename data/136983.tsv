2007-08-10T11:07:00.000Z	LuiCal		please
2007-08-10T11:08:00.000Z	scipio	LuiCal	just an idea since i'm also kinda new but did you check if openoffice uses the right printer when it tries to print?
2007-08-10T11:12:00.000Z	scipio	LuiCal	can you open the file with another aplication and try to print from there? maybe even convert it to pdf? or try to search on the forums for your specific printer to see if anyone else had the same problems
