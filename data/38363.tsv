2010-02-02T22:04:00.000Z	aar		Hi, is there a CLI tool that will display a progress (or calculate ETA) when copyinga nd moving files?
2010-02-02T22:06:00.000Z	archboxman	aar	pipes are power
2010-02-02T22:07:00.000Z	aar	archboxman	yeah I read about pv through a pipe, but it seems silly having to work out a 10 inch line of code just to copy a file from A to B. Is there really no ready-made and well-integrated tool out there?
