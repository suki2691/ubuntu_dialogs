2011-06-24T14:41:00.000Z	book1		i cannot install any soft from software-center. when i press install authentication window appears and dissapears immediately(with text "Your authentication attempts was unsuccesful. try again").  i think it is because i ve changed permissions for /usr. How can i fix it? When i type gksudo software-center all is ok. Please help
