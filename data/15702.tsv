2012-02-18T14:45:00.000Z	barnex		it seems to do some deep magic, pausing all users program when I switch users?
2012-02-18T14:45:00.000Z	hydrox24	barnex	not sure about that, although I never use the switch user funstion.
2012-02-18T14:48:00.000Z	hydrox24	barnex	that wouldnt be pausing processes, just pulseaudio doing some muting.
