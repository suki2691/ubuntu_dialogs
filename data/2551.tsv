2012-06-11T19:47:00.000Z	lukstr		hey guys, anyone ever seen an issue where my account password and the password I enter in sudo differ? It appears that sudo has a case sensitivity issue... I'm using xubuntu 12.04
2012-06-11T19:48:00.000Z	Oer	lukstr	 not likely
2012-06-11T19:50:00.000Z	lukstr	Oer	I'd tend to agree, however I'm not sure at this point
2012-06-11T19:54:00.000Z	lukstr	Oer	I'm using pam-krb5 if that helps?
