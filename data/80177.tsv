2008-10-01T23:27:00.000Z	xomp	RediXe	firefox has gone to sh*t here of late, constantly crashing for no reason.
2008-10-01T23:28:00.000Z	RediXe		Thanks for all the response's ... it actually managed to kill itself before I was able to :P
2008-10-01T23:28:00.000Z	RediXe	xomp	Yeah, I want to give google Chrome a try but doesn't seem to have a linux version out.
