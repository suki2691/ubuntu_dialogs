2009-01-24T14:16:00.000Z	ein2015	Flannel	do you have any ideas why olivier_ might not be able to VNC into a box he has VNC server on, port 5901 forwarded to, etc?
2009-01-24T14:17:00.000Z	Flannel	ein2015	I know (almost) nothing about VNC.  So, assuming the forwarding is proper, and he's connecting to the right IP.  Nope
2009-01-25T13:52:00.000Z	ein2015	Flannel	off topic, but are you in here often? :)
2009-01-25T13:52:00.000Z	Flannel	ein2015	Indeed. Also, we do have #ubuntu-offtopic if you have offtopic questions
