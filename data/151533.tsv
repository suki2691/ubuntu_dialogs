2007-04-17T16:38:00.000Z	bef		hey, I downloaded VirtualBox from http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads -- I just got the Edgy version (but am running 15/04 daily build of Feisty) Install ran smoothly until the liscence screen came up.. I can't figure out where to press OK or accept, there is an OK text at the bottom but not clickable nor can I press enter on it. Have tried typing YES and Y... any ideas?
