2012-04-26T17:17:00.000Z	Sjimmie		I just did an upgrade from ubuntu server 10.04 to 12.04 and it crashed. Now I'm stuck with this message http://pastebin.com/bGecwns5
2012-04-26T17:17:00.000Z	Sjimmie		anyone any suggestions? I did an LTS -> LTS upgrade
2012-04-26T17:19:00.000Z	Sjimmie		It crashed here during the gcc upgrades
2012-04-26T17:20:00.000Z	joemppe	Sjimmie	can you remove the offending packages?
