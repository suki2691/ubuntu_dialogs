2012-07-12T13:27:00.000Z	eph3meral		what's the official way to get skype on 12.04? this FAQ seems a bit dated (10.10) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype
2012-07-12T13:29:00.000Z	eph3meral		the only thing I see here, http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/get-skype/on-your-computer/linux is still for 10.10
2012-07-12T13:30:00.000Z	dwakar	eph3meral	there is a static install available in skype's website
2012-07-12T13:30:00.000Z	eph3meral	dwakar	what does that mean? how is it different from the .deb I linked just now
