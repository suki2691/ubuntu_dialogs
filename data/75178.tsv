2008-11-08T07:51:00.000Z	remu		Hey guys, I'm running Ubuntu Intrepid. I wanted to run Windows XP through a virtual machine, and also possibly test out some other distros. My quextion is, what is the best way to do this on Intrepid?

2008-11-08T07:52:00.000Z	remu	qpdb	sudo apt-get install virtualbox (on intrepid this will work?)
2008-11-08T07:52:00.000Z	qpdb	remu	yes, the package name is virtualbox-ose .. but maybe you prefer the new 2.0 version.. (not in repo)
