2008-08-29T10:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BiNaRyCoDe	Have you tried installing more than once?
2008-08-29T10:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BiNaRyCoDe	Maybe it was just a failed install for some reason, it might install fine with the alternate install CD or maybe do an integrity check on the CD you have ( it's an option at boot or you can check the md5sum )
