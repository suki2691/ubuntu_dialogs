2007-08-13T16:00:00.000Z	Frogzoo		all my desktop icons are now text files called xxxx.desktop - any ideas?
2007-08-13T07:55:00.000Z	TylerJGillies	Frogzoo	whats the difference between /dev/zero and /dev/null?
2007-08-13T07:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	TylerJGillies	/dev/zero is reads only zeros, /dev/null reads as eof, and writes as a bit bucket
2007-08-13T07:57:00.000Z	TylerJGillies	Frogzoo	thnx
