2010-01-20T18:00:00.000Z	jenda		I appear to have some problems with applications sharing audio devices. When amarok is running, any flash videos in firefox freeze and crash firefox - also, I can't run fallout in wine, which freezes as soon as it is to make the first sounds, reporting an ALSA/Pulseaudio error (unable to create stream, too large). Any ideas?
