2009-10-30T22:40:00.000Z	roy		Somebody please tell me what would be the ideal partitioning for Karmic on 20GB space and 2GB RAM...
2009-10-30T22:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	roy	6 gigs for root "/", 1 gig swap .. the rest for /home
2009-10-30T22:45:00.000Z	Scunizi	roy	4 gigs of swap is overkill.. unless you're doing lots of video production
