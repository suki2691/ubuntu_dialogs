2007-05-24T10:07:00.000Z	insomniac190		can anyone tell me if i should change my kernel?
2007-05-24T10:07:00.000Z	crimsun	insomniac190	is anything not working currently?
2007-05-24T10:09:00.000Z	crimsun	insomniac190	it requires a 586 (Pentium-class) CPU but runs on anything newer.
2007-05-24T10:10:00.000Z	insomniac190	crimsun	okay, i just wanted to make sure the kernel i was using wasnt holding back my processor.  thanks
