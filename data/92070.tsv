2008-06-21T03:23:00.000Z	rainabba		Getting along pretty decent with my new 8.04 install, but I'm catching hell setting up samba shares using any GUIs. System>Administration>File Sharing (or similiar) doesn't exist and the Nautilus Sharing dialog fails citing file permissions in /var/lib/samba/usershares, but I'm in the sambasharing group. Help? Another GUI I could use?
