2007-07-28T06:24:00.000Z	madman91		is there a way I can setup a dialog window/box/message to show me when a program wants to connect to somewhere.. and allow me to disable/enable it?
2007-07-28T06:25:00.000Z	astro76	madman91	are you trying to block something in particular?
2007-07-28T06:25:00.000Z	madman91	astro76	well no.. i know how to do that with firestarter.. just in general
2007-07-28T06:26:00.000Z	madman91	astro76	just to monitor outbound connections before they connect
