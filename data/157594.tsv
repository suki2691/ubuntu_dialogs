2008-05-02T03:19:00.000Z	shane2peru	evilbug	just never done it before, I mean mounting iso's is a synch and in theory, upgrading via that iso mounted shouldn't be a problem either
2008-05-02T03:19:00.000Z	shane2peru	evilbug	I have never even upgraded via a cd, so, maybe it would be easy, just not sure.
