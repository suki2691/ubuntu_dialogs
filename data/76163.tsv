2008-12-13T22:16:00.000Z	outofhismind		I have a quite unique problem, no luck finding any info through google
2008-12-13T22:17:00.000Z	mker	outofhismind	no one can solve it unless you tell us about it
2008-12-13T22:18:00.000Z	mker	outofhismind	you shouln't ask if someone knows or if someone has the same piece of hardware. you should just ask right away so we don't have to try to get the question out of you. and *please* keep it in one message, it's really hard to read when it's spread out over several messages
