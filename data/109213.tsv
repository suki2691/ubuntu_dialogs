2008-07-26T12:22:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Chris|	hide them where? Ubuntu doesn't put them on the desktop by default, I had to download a program to put them back
2008-07-26T12:23:00.000Z	Chris|	LSD|Ninja	there is a option in gconf to hide those specific icons, or more or less turn them on
2008-07-26T12:23:00.000Z	Chris|	LSD|Ninja	i want a way to turn them off by command, anyone know of a way
