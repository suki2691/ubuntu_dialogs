2010-11-08T02:02:00.000Z	WACOMalt		Ok, got ubuntu studio up. Now I need the 64bit flash plugin for both chrome and firefox.  Any updated guides out there? most seem outdated, or only for the 32bit one.

2010-11-08T02:04:00.000Z	jann	WACOMalt	Chrome or Chromium? Because I'm on x64 Ubuntu and my chrome daily has it built in.
