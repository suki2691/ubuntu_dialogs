2006-10-22T08:51:00.000Z	jhaig		The press release for version 6.10 RC gives a target release date of 26th.  Is this looking likely?  I ask as someone thinking of either installing 6.04 or waiting a few more days.

2006-10-22T08:53:00.000Z	jhaig	fnf	Thanks.  Erm, dare I suggest that that is the purpose of beta/RC releases?  ;-)
2006-10-22T08:54:00.000Z	fnf	jhaig	In all honesty, I'd trust the developers, but who knows ;) ?
