2012-04-21T01:13:00.000Z	troubled	Guest307	no idea, i use debian on servers at home here, havent used ubuntu. but if your iso has the pv/vg/lv LVM tools and mdadm, you could do it by hand I guess
2012-04-21T01:32:00.000Z	troubled	Guest307	good to know, thanks. so im guessing its not a problem to do it, just that you have to do it manually via menus instead of automatic partitioning or something?
