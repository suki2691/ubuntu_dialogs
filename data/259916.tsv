2005-04-08T10:47:00.000Z	e_machinist		But it is kinda hard to use both interchangably all the time.
2005-04-08T10:49:00.000Z	e_machinist		It is nice that there are two, gnome and kde, large, very competitive projects... I for one hope there will be only one some day though.
2005-04-08T10:50:00.000Z	regeya	e_machinist	never.  gnome is aimed at the "average user" and kde is aimed at users. ;-)  gnome is better for grandma and people who desire a simple interface, and kde is for weirdos like me. ;-)
