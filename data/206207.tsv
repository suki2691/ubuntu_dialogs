2010-02-06T16:26:00.000Z	mika__		I've another question for you. I'm looking at the server edition. Is there something like landscape, but free? (as I'm setting up my home server for some try I cannot afford to pay for it :( )

2010-02-06T16:28:00.000Z	mika__	Seveas	ok, thank you, I'll look at them
2010-02-06T16:29:00.000Z	Seveas	mika__	ah, if you want 'just a webinterface', erUSUL gave the correct answer :)
