2009-07-16T13:12:00.000Z	joshua__		another Xubuntu question, is there a package repository management applet like the one in GNOME?
2009-07-16T13:14:00.000Z	grawity	joshua__	Xfce usually just uses the GNOME apps - "Software Sources" is software-properties-gtk, Synaptic is 'synaptic'
2009-07-16T13:23:00.000Z	grawity	joshua__	Xfce usually uses GNOME's tools, most of which you can install separately. Try update-manager
2009-07-16T13:24:00.000Z	grawity	joshua__	Oh, and update-notifier.
