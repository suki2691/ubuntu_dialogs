2010-05-24T01:38:00.000Z	sint		hey, anyone using "mc" here? i wonder how to enable the usual mc look and feel in ubuntu? like white bold names for folders?
2010-05-24T01:39:00.000Z	sint		i run 10.04
2010-05-24T01:40:00.000Z	greezmunkey	sint	I have that running here, but honestly don't see as much of a need for it as I first thought, now that nautilus has split screens and such
2010-05-24T01:40:00.000Z	sint	greezmunkey	ok i prefer mc over nautilus in terminal ;)
