2008-10-26T20:42:00.000Z	Caleb|		Hey folks.  Got a problem here.  Just installed ubuntu and I'm loving it.  I finally got the install for my graohics card to work, and boom.  I boot up, and then my mouse stops working.  It's a PS/2 mouse.  I know most people use USB, but my 4 USB ports are filled by my keyboard, my mic, my webcam, and my iPod.  Any help would be great, thanks!
