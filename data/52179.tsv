2011-10-12T21:53:00.000Z	alkisg	xrdodrx	thanks, ouch that makes wubi much less usuable than I thought :(

2011-10-12T21:55:00.000Z	alkisg	xrdodrx	yes, but I thought that if it allocated the whole 10 gb up front, it wouldn't have to bother too much with ntfs, as no sectors would be even reallocated... :-/
