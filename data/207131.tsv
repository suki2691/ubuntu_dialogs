2006-03-12T11:40:00.000Z	_keroppi_		I installed amarok for Ubuntu, and when I hit play, it merely skips through the songs really fast. I have the oss output plugin, pointed to the correct sound device (same settings as xmms, which works fine). Anyone know what might be up? I couldn't find a solution with google or in the amarok faq.
