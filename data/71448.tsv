2010-12-21T00:32:00.000Z	Some_Person		If I install lucid over a screwed up maverick install, will lucid work ok, and will /home be preserved? Will I need to make a new user?
2010-12-21T00:32:00.000Z	etheretic	Some_Person	make a new partition and install to it.
2010-12-21T00:32:00.000Z	Some_Person	etheretic	I don't want to make a new partition
2010-12-21T00:32:00.000Z	Some_Person	etheretic	I already have 4 primary partitions, so the new one would have to be extended
