2006-04-23T12:49:00.000Z	Strayhikari		Hello, really new user with most likely a stupid question
2006-04-23T12:49:00.000Z	Strayhikari		Does aptget have a system wide update command?
2006-04-23T12:49:00.000Z	spikeb	Strayhikari	apt-get upgrade or apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-04-23T12:49:00.000Z	spikeb	Strayhikari	and that's one of the more intelligent questions we've seen here tonight heh
