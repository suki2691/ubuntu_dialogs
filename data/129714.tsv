2007-06-26T06:48:00.000Z	tony_00021		umm anyone interested in helping me help myself and som others potentially... i need to find out how to uncompress a file.. i adictionary file to extract the words... maybe make a script so anyone owning such a file can convert to openoffice or other opensource format for themselves...
2007-06-26T06:49:00.000Z	Ausicaemia	tony_00021	That uh... didn't make a whole lot of sense.
2007-06-26T06:53:00.000Z	tony_00021	Ausicaemia	sorry. ms-office has a file format called .lex where they store the diccionary ..in my case swedish. i want to convert this to a format that i can use w for example openoffice . openoffice has no diccionary for swedish for example.. a know i guy who keeps XP just for tha diccionaries in german and swedish...
2007-06-26T06:54:00.000Z	tony_00021	Ausicaemia	the format is compressed somehow.. maybe like a .cab file or something.
