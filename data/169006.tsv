2007-04-10T11:52:00.000Z	snedar		hi! since feisty is almost stable, I don't need a separate ubuntu testing partition anymore. so now I need to install another distribution to play with. any ideas? is the new debian somehow exciting?
2007-04-10T11:53:00.000Z	tonyr1988	snedar	try Gentoo or something :)
2007-04-10T11:53:00.000Z	tonyr1988	snedar	or that OLPC OS...but I think it's LiveCD-only
2007-04-10T11:54:00.000Z	snedar	tonyr1988	already tried gentoo some times, but I don't like the compiling times :-) I've ran the OLPC OS through vmware, might be cool to try newer versions...
