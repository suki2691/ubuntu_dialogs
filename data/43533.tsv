2009-11-06T09:50:00.000Z	scunizi	mobutut	win modems are a pain and 90% of them don't work
2009-11-06T09:50:00.000Z	mobutut	scunizi	there is a lot of success stories on the forums about them, just most the tutorials are for older kernels
2009-11-06T09:51:00.000Z	scunizi	mobutut	of the 7 I've tried I've had no success.. ended up buying an external usb US Robotics fax/modem.. worked like a champ..
