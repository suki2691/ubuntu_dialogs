2006-03-14T08:46:00.000Z	nickrud	DanielSHaischt	yeah, I'd say it's not a sane thing. Not to say that, with a lot of stroking, it can't be done.
2006-03-14T08:46:00.000Z	DanielSHaischt	nickrud	and would it be possible to dist-upgrade at least to breezy?
2006-03-14T08:47:00.000Z	nickrud	DanielSHaischt	I've seen people try, and some claim success.
