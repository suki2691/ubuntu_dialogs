2008-07-30T09:04:00.000Z	hkittysmoothie		I can't get any sound in Hardy to play unless I unplug and re-plug in the cord, at which point it repeats about a quarter-second of sound over and over again. How do I fix this?

2008-07-30T09:07:00.000Z	hkittysmoothie	Mr_Bunny_	I have to unplug the audio cable that goes to my speakers, and I'm using pulseaudio
2008-07-30T09:08:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	hkittysmoothie	so you're just using standard audio jacks? that sounds really weird...
