2008-05-22T17:34:00.000Z	Viden		Good morning everyone, I have an issue with Evolution.  When i click print via either the print button, or the drop down menu Evoltion causes a segmentation fault and closes.  Does anyone know how to find out what is causing it, or a fix for it?

2008-05-22T17:35:00.000Z	Viden	Pici	 thanks, I already looked and although there are similar issues, there is none that match it.  I would like to report the bug to them, but really am unsure how to collect enough information to be helpful.
