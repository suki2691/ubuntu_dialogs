2009-11-10T22:06:00.000Z	kreator		high speed ssd
2009-11-10T22:06:00.000Z	spwelton	kreator	I would probably use ext4, but I'm not very knowledgeable on SSD's
2009-11-10T22:08:00.000Z	spwelton	kreator	IDK, you might have a hard time finding a non-journalling file system that is halfway decent. Even ext2 has journalling IIRC
