2009-12-14T00:41:00.000Z	jb39cj9	user__	that's just the name of the script
2009-12-14T00:42:00.000Z	jb39cj9	user__	sshd is just an alias to ssh(daemon) ... like i said before it's a script that starts the ssh server
2009-12-14T00:43:00.000Z	user__	jb39cj9	ah thanks, so in this case ssh represents sshd? =)
