2012-05-24T18:27:00.000Z	Heartbeats		Ok i'm trying to edit the repositories list and in terminal it says bash:.. permission denied
2012-05-24T18:27:00.000Z	jrib	Heartbeats	what did you type?
2012-05-24T18:28:00.000Z	jrib	Heartbeats	you want to open /etc/apt/sources.list in an *editor*
2012-05-24T18:29:00.000Z	jrib	Heartbeats	is there a reason you aren't using Software Properties for managing repositories?
