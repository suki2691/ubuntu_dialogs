2009-01-12T21:11:00.000Z	boghog		my mom's PC harddisk crashed and we lost the key for windows XP, so I installed Ubuntu on it instead and I would just like to say that I am very impressed by it, installation was a snap, and both the printer *and* scanner worked by default, it really blew my mind
2009-01-12T21:11:00.000Z	sarmisak	boghog	what's the scanner?
2009-01-12T21:12:00.000Z	boghog	sarmisak	an HP scanjet 4000something I think
