2008-11-03T06:12:00.000Z	ThersiT		Hey ya'll, I'm following a how to found at  http://www.krizka.net/2008/03/28/how-to-setup-fprint-for-fingerprint-authentication-on-ubuntu/  and it had me add a new repository to my sources list... But when I try to install the software the how to asks me to it says it's not found.
2008-11-03T06:12:00.000Z	ThersiT		Is there any way to browse the repository to see if the software is realy.
2008-11-03T06:13:00.000Z	slacker_nl	ThersiT	did you run aptitude update before you want to install the package?
2008-11-03T06:17:00.000Z	slacker_nl	ThersiT	aptitude search <package> is what I would do
