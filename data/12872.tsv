2011-06-26T18:27:00.000Z	PAB		What is hte concurrency level (i.e. the --jobs variable in make)  for an 8 thread CPU (i7- 2600k)? I want to use 8. Too many could lead in a conflict, too less wouldn't use entire power of the CPU. Right?
2011-06-26T18:27:00.000Z	sudokill	PAB	use -j9
2011-06-26T18:27:00.000Z	sudokill		recommended to use 1 more
