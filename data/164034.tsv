2007-03-24T07:35:00.000Z	spuck		Ok now I finally got into the livecd, tried to play a video in that experience ubuntu folder, then everything froze. :/ seems this distribution doesn't like me. :( What can be the reason for this crash/freeze?
2007-03-24T07:36:00.000Z	bulmer	spuck	umm too slow of a cdrom player so by the time it needs a library from cdrom it freezes?
2007-03-24T07:37:00.000Z	spuck	bulmer	could be so, would I still be able to install ubuntu?
2007-03-24T07:40:00.000Z	bulmer	spuck	i thnk you will still be able to install, but why not reboot on same liveCD and then start a fresh install instead of after a crash
