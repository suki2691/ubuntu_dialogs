2011-03-04T00:59:00.000Z	ryepup	ActionParsnip	I can cat /proc/2260/fd/3 with no problem, but ln -L says "no file", even when autocompleting
2011-03-04T01:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ryepup	thats why then ;)
2011-03-04T01:04:00.000Z	ryepup	ActionParsnip	I guess I don't understand why cat would be able to see it an ln -L can't.  Seems like I must be stoing something silly
