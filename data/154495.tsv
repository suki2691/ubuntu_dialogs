2006-12-17T07:15:00.000Z	Gumby		considering that neither ATI or nVidia offer anything but proprietary drivers I fail to see how anyone can say that one is better than the other
2006-12-17T07:16:00.000Z	l3mr	Gumby	ati's drivers are a pain in the ass to setup. nvidia's are closed source too, but a lot more userfriendly
2006-12-17T07:16:00.000Z	Gumby	l3mr	Ive never had an issue following the instructions for ATI.
2006-12-17T07:17:00.000Z	l3mr	Gumby	lucky you :)
