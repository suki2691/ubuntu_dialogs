2006-05-20T16:02:00.000Z	artis		sure.
2006-05-20T16:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	artis	i tend to disagree. gpl ensures freedom bsd on the other hand does not. but is a counter productive flamewar so i will remain silent... (emacs rulez XD)
2006-05-20T16:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	artis	look at apple. apple (and m$) had taken (stolen) bsd code making it propietary as the license permits. the modifications both companies had make to the code will never revert to the comunity we loose. with gpl code all the work that ibm, hp, etc have done to make linux better comes back to us
