2007-07-28T11:15:00.000Z	WankusMusculus		Does anyone know what "X11:1" is and why its opened my port 6001?
2007-07-28T11:16:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	WankusMusculus	something to do with Xserver I guess...
2007-07-28T11:16:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	WankusMusculus	I'm not completly sure though, I know the xorg.conf file to configure X is in /etc/X11 but I dunno why it would open any ports
2007-07-28T11:16:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	WankusMusculus	no idea, sorry
