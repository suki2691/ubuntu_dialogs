2008-01-06T00:47:00.000Z	scguy318	JC_Denton_	well, I know that on Windows, the VNC Server can easily add a VNC listener, but I'm not sure how that's done on Linux

2008-01-06T00:48:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	scguy318	it's because of both being behind a router and only one being configured properly - the client side
