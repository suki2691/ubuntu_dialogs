2004-11-20T09:54:00.000Z	Zugwrack		My sound volume is very low for system sounds even with it maxed out...when playing through xmms streamed music sound muted, and distorted...I checked prefs and changed xmms to use ALSA...
2004-11-20T09:55:00.000Z	MoonSweep	Zugwrack	did you maxed the different mixers (PCM, CD...) ?
2004-11-20T09:56:00.000Z	Zugwrack	MoonSweep	Yes, and ran alsamixer from konsole for good measure just to be sure
