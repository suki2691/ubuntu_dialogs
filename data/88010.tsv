2012-04-26T22:54:00.000Z	Debolaz		Is booting with an encrypted disk and btrfs filesystem supported again in 12.04?
2012-04-26T22:55:00.000Z	helo	Debolaz	encrypted /home is, and btrfs is... not sure about together, but i'd assume yes
2012-04-26T22:55:00.000Z	Debolaz	helo	I'll have a try and see. I used to work in ubuntu, then some random changes fibered it.
2012-04-26T22:55:00.000Z	helo	Debolaz	btrfs for / sucks though, performance is baaad
