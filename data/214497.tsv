2007-04-26T08:52:00.000Z	eck	Kubuntu_noob	they are supposed to correspond roughly to different executing environments
2007-04-26T08:52:00.000Z	eck	Kubuntu_noob	e.g. runlevel 1 is single user, 3 is multiuser, 5 is graphical
2007-04-26T08:53:00.000Z	eck	Kubuntu_noob	they are totally nonstandard though and in practice used to enforce boot sequence
