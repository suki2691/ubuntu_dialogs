2012-02-20T13:56:00.000Z	ryanyeah	terminhell	well i don't have a physical monitor attached to it. but i go into the ubuntu resolution settings and the max is only 800x600. i can change settings to 150% on tightvnc but that just zooms in, so it does increase resolution but it makes it blurry
2012-02-20T13:57:00.000Z	Ben64	ryanyeah	you'd have to set resolution on the vncserver
