2008-11-07T04:16:00.000Z	alec		im interested in setting up a flash drive so i can boot to linux off a windows pc. can anyone point me in the right direction?

2008-11-07T04:18:00.000Z	zsquareplusc		apropos, usb boot with the provided tool. i just got a crc error... hardware failure or failure to prepare the stick correctly?
2008-11-07T04:18:00.000Z	alec	zsquareplusc	would that be the best way for me to run ubuntu with all my settings and mail without installing on a computer?
