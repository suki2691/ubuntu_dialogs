2007-01-25T11:40:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Sk8aelf	maybe.  What kinds of questions?
2007-01-25T11:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Sk8aelf	I think it's something like mysql-adduser.  It's built into mysql, as a command similar to that at least.
2007-01-25T12:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Sk8aelf	I'd offer more, but I'm an LA person, not MP ;)
