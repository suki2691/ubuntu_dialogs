2009-05-22T01:04:00.000Z	produnis		i read, that the firewire-iSight Webcam would run, if coriander and libdc1394 is installed... I apt-get install coriander, and it automatically fetched libdc1394-22 and libraw1394-8
2009-05-22T01:04:00.000Z	produnis		but if I try to start coriander, it says: "libdc1394 error: Failed to initialize libdc1394
