2007-10-25T15:05:00.000Z	inversekinetix		i just installed wine and am having a hell of a time trying to figure out why there is no d3d support, any ideas?
2007-10-25T15:06:00.000Z	hwilde	inversekinetix	maybe because it is an emulator and it does not have direct access to the hardware
2007-10-25T15:08:00.000Z	hwilde	inversekinetix	does direct 3d work outside of wine
2007-10-25T15:14:00.000Z	hwilde	inversekinetix	synaptics is your friend
