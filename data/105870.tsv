2008-12-28T16:48:00.000Z	d_mitry		i've had a slight mishap whilst trying to resize an ntfs partition within ubuntu using gparted. the computer experienced a hang during the process. now i can't mount the partition -- "NTFS signature is missing". is there way to recover?

2008-12-28T16:50:00.000Z	d_mitry	CaptainMorgan	if i did, i wouldn't be asking. i took a bad risk.
