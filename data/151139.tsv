2007-01-11T11:47:00.000Z	Milos_SD		hello everyone... I have a little problem with burning DVD's with K3B and my new Pioneer 111D ... Burning is slow (6-7x)... How can I fix this?
2007-01-11T11:47:00.000Z	madcheez2	Milos_SD	did you enable dma?
2007-01-11T11:48:00.000Z	Milos_SD	madcheez2	Yes
2007-01-11T11:49:00.000Z	madcheez2	Milos_SD	im not sure then, i would think that dma mode should speed it up...
