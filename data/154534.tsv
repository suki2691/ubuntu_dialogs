2007-07-10T12:32:00.000Z	loca|host		i've just installed Feisty on my new PC, and it doesnt slow down the CPU fans when the system starts, it's like if Ubuntu doesnt know if the CPU is cold so it must slow down the fans, and that began to be really very noisy

2007-07-10T12:36:00.000Z	scorp123	loca|host	mostly laptops --but desktops and barebones too-- can have a messed-up BIOS or ACPI instruction set, so Linux can't 100% reliably read the status of the CPU, of the fans or the temperature .... so it can happen that the fans run all the time or not at all .... I suggest you Google around, maybe there is an ACPI fix for your particular PC model?
