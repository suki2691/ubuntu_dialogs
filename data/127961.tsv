2009-02-15T09:06:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	MaxRide	I'm just wondering if looking at the raw data we can determine *what* over-wrote the MBR
2009-02-15T09:07:00.000Z	MaxRide	IntuitiveNipple	Doesn't really matter at this point...you can rewrite the MBR all you want, but it looks as though the partition table MAY be messed up as well.
2009-02-15T09:09:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	MaxRide	The MBR/partition table are in sector 0... if something over-writes them it is sometimes possible to know what... and knowing that, you can make a judgement as to whether the partition table can be rebuilt.
2009-02-15T09:10:00.000Z	MaxRide	IntuitiveNipple	 Yea....But looking at his other dump, things don't look so well when it comes to the partitions....MBR is easy to fix, but the partition table could be a real problem.
