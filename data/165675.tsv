2006-12-17T10:26:00.000Z	markus	craigbass1976	depends on what you want
2006-12-17T10:26:00.000Z	craigbass1976	markus	I mean the commands to add users, do queries and what not
2006-12-17T10:27:00.000Z	markus	craigbass1976	users groups and roles are not part of the sql standard afaik, at least mysql and postgresql are very different in this area. the sql is similar
