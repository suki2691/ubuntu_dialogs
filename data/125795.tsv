2007-08-06T16:42:00.000Z	opi		hi there, can anyone point me to apt repo that still keeps Breezy packages?
2007-08-06T16:43:00.000Z	peddler_dude	opi	Why don't you upgrade?
2007-08-06T16:43:00.000Z	opi	peddler_dude	because I can't -- it's not important, I need few packages to build something
2007-08-06T16:43:00.000Z	opi	peddler_dude	and archive.ubuntu.com dropped'em all
