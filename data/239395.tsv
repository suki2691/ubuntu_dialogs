2005-11-09T06:14:00.000Z	Skaarg		I was wondering if I could get some help with booting ubuntu AMD64 version on my comp?
2005-11-09T06:14:00.000Z	Skaarg		It gets an Ok when loading everything and then after that it goes to a black screen plays the startup sound and locks up
2005-11-09T06:14:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Skaarg	: what version of ubuntu?
2005-11-09T06:15:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Skaarg	: i had the problem with 5.04 but i just made my own kernel to fix it.. prolly a problem with display card.. try vga=normal when you bootup.. just might work.. though i use lilo...
