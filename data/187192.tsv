2007-01-09T16:20:00.000Z	Thunderguy		Hey I was wondering, is there a way I can build a custom Ubuntu install with apt-get? What I mean is a base-install just to get me to a shell and with networking, that I can work with to apt-get my way to the system I want?
2007-01-09T16:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Thunderguy	not really
2007-01-09T16:20:00.000Z	Thunderguy	ikonia	So I'd basically have to go with a Debian Stable, then modify the sources?
2007-01-09T16:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Thunderguy	no that wouldn't work
