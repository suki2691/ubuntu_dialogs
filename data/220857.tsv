2005-09-20T14:42:00.000Z	robzon		eh ok, I've got it
2005-09-20T14:42:00.000Z	Jowi	robzon	in gconf-editor - go to apps -> nautilus-cd-burner. there is an option there to turn it on
2005-09-20T14:43:00.000Z	robzon	Jowi	yeah, I've found it, thx :) but I thought that there might be some more easy-accessible place to turn it on.
