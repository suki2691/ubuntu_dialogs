2009-03-01T09:15:00.000Z	shyam_k		hi  i am getting error from apt-get, "E: Unable to write to /var/cache/apt/" "E: The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened." for apt-get install and for apt-update E: Archive directory /var/cache/apt/archives/partial is missing." and to my surprise, i am missing even the directory /var/cache/apt/ and all things worked perfectly before.. What could be the problem?
