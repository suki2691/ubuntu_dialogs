2005-12-17T15:47:00.000Z	H0gan		Ok, so I am using Windows XP home. I created a partition and it rebooted, but it is rebooted from the new partition, and seeing as nothing is on it, I get a message 'No Operating System' So I am trying to Install Ubuntu,but when I get to the 'Partition Disks' part I dont see an option to install it on the new partion. Just options to create or erase the current partition. Can anyone help?

2005-12-17T15:48:00.000Z	H0gan	trappist	I go into that and I see my new partition, but then when I try to continue it just refreshes back to the Partition Disk screen
