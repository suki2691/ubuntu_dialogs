2011-07-07T19:20:00.000Z	a1cd		Hey guys, Just wondering if there is a large difference between 10.4.1 vs 10.4.2? If so is the upgrade procedure the same as moving up from 9.x?

2011-07-07T19:20:00.000Z	ikonia	a1cd	you just need to update the packages via update-manager
2011-07-07T19:20:00.000Z	ikonia	a1cd	it's not a "release" it's just updates, if you keep up to date with the package manager, you're already running 10.4.2
