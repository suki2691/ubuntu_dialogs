2006-08-29T08:57:00.000Z	greatauk		I have two harddrives, but they're configured so that Windows only sees them as one C: drive so the latter has an invalid partition table
2006-08-29T08:58:00.000Z	greatauk		anyone know: if I install Kubuntu on one of them, will Windows be corrupt?
2006-08-29T08:58:00.000Z	longwave	greatauk	is that a RAID 0 setup or windows dynamic disks?
2006-08-29T08:58:00.000Z	longwave	greatauk	if it is RAID 0 in hardware it should work, if it is dynamic disks i would definitely make a backup before letting any partition editors make any changes
