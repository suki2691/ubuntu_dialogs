2007-04-16T10:28:00.000Z	sidny4		how do I allow myself to use port 110 with out being in root (using thunderbird webmail extension)
2007-04-16T10:30:00.000Z	sidny4		how do I open up ports < 1024 to non-root users?
2007-04-16T10:31:00.000Z	paroxysm	sidny4	use sudo
2007-04-16T10:32:00.000Z	sidny4	paroxysm	I know I can run thunderbird as sudo, but I'd rather let it have access to ports 110 and 25 without running it as root
