2005-05-25T10:15:00.000Z	yaaar		hey guys....i don't want to sound pushy here, but my situation is that i switched my roommate to ubuntu from windows, and he's nagging me to go back over this file manager issue. that's the only problem we have on the machine, and i'm not at all willing to go through a PITA windows installation. so can somebody, anybody, give me a pointer or two on why this thing takes 2-3 minutes to open folders, and what i can do about it?

2005-05-25T10:16:00.000Z	yaaar	tahorg	i've only said that aobut a dozen times this morning
2005-05-25T10:17:00.000Z	tahorg	yaaar	good luck to solve it then ...
