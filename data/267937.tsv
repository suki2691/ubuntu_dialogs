2007-05-28T16:58:00.000Z	Mischa		what do I do if two partitions were given the same UUID?
2007-05-28T16:58:00.000Z	Mischa		it's mismounting a partition because of it
2007-05-28T05:00:00.000Z	Mischa		question: can I in fstab use the old /dev/hd** notation instead of UUID, to identify a partition to mount?
