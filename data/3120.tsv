2012-05-12T04:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joshdevel12	Please be patient. "sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf-fglrx-backup"
2012-05-12T04:52:00.000Z	joshdevel12	Jordan_U	ive already done that   i cant think of a reason why it still points to fglrx, but im guessing it has to do with update-alternatives.
2012-05-12T04:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joshdevel12	So you currently have no /etc/X11/xorg.conf at all?
