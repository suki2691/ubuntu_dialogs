2007-03-04T10:20:00.000Z	directhex		i've got a problem with extremely high cpu load accompanying disk access on my server box. disks are a raid5 array behind an lsi megeraid hardware raid controller, megaraid_mbox module
2007-03-04T10:22:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	directhex	because Amarok uses QT as it's graphics lib and Gnome is built on GTK...    few distros make the transition as easy as ubuntu
2007-03-04T10:24:00.000Z	directhex	FunnyLookinHat	why would the windowing toolkit make a difference? gtk+, qt, xaw3d, motif, wxwidgets, whatever. they're all just libraries
2007-03-04T10:24:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	directhex	right...  but until the last year or so, it did make a difference... don't blame me, blame developers.
