2011-06-18T09:15:00.000Z	adurodea	arch_nme	depends on the program most let you set where when doing ./configure using --prefix otherwise use find and look for it
2011-06-18T09:16:00.000Z	arch_nme	adurodea	I didn't set anything I just typed ./configure
2011-06-18T09:16:00.000Z	arch_nme	adurodea	it could be anywhere on my hdd though?
