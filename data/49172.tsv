2011-06-08T02:26:00.000Z	Craig`	OctoByte	yes it's my main partition
2011-06-08T02:27:00.000Z	Craig`	OctoByte	you see i'm using this program and it one of the arguments has to be the drive you want the output to be stored at, i was hoping i can just direct the output to where i execute the command but no said i could.
2011-06-08T02:29:00.000Z	Craig`	OctoByte	http://pastie.org/2034553 -- you see the second argument requires a drive, i didn't really want to specify a drive (as i don't want it on a different drive etc), do you have any idea how i could do this?
