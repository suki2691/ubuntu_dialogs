2005-12-05T11:41:00.000Z	[matrim] 	HappyFool	do I need to reboot?
2005-12-05T11:43:00.000Z	[matrim] 	HappyFool	OK, thanks, now I just need to find ut why nothing is starting after I changed hostname :/
2005-12-05T11:45:00.000Z	[matrim] 	HappyFool	Hmm, would be good if I had done that I think, since it needs to be listed to work
