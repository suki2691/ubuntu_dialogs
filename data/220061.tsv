2007-07-15T10:39:00.000Z	Flannel	wizek	sudo nano /path/to/file
2007-07-15T10:40:00.000Z	Flannel	wizek	No, the path.  What file are you editing?
2007-07-15T10:42:00.000Z	Flannel	wizek	Ah, first you'd have to mount it somewhere.  But, you know you can make changes to the grub menu entries while at the grub menu, right?
