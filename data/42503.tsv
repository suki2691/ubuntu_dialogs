2011-03-13T06:18:00.000Z	blue112		I don't understand why my laptop, pretty new, running on ubuntu 10.10 reach very high CPU temperatures without much thing on it (about 95Â°C with just music and a flashplayer in a browser running)
2011-03-13T06:19:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	blue112	flash, problem solved
2011-03-13T06:19:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	blue112	90% of laptops are like that
