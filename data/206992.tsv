2006-08-22T06:48:00.000Z	Krankily		Anyone familiar with the xserver-xorg.core 1:1.0.2-0ubuntu10.3 update? It seems to have hose my install?
2006-08-22T06:50:00.000Z	Krankily		I'll have to install it again and just avoid the update
2006-08-22T06:50:00.000Z	Krankily		I'll assume one can't downgrade the update?
2006-08-22T06:51:00.000Z	nanno	Krankily	it can easily be downgraded
