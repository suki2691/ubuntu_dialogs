2008-04-28T00:38:00.000Z	malsyned		In the middle of upgrading to 8.04, my computer has become almost completely unresponsive.  It looks, from the CPU and Memory panel applets, that something is gobbling memory and causing constant swapping.
2008-04-28T00:39:00.000Z	malsyned		I'm going to try to unwedge it, if I can get to the console, but if that doesn't work, is it possible to restart the upgrade process if I am forced to hard-boot the machine?

2008-04-28T00:42:00.000Z	jng	malsyned	i had an upgrade that was racing like that.. scrollkeeper was the culprit.. sudo pkill scrollkeeper  .. nudged it along
