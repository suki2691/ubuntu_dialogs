2006-06-06T10:10:00.000Z	BigBon		Why is Ubuntu so popular?
2006-06-06T10:10:00.000Z	intelikey	BigBon	it's the flavor of the month
2006-06-06T10:13:00.000Z	intelikey	BigBon	yes it does.  i've watched rh be popular and mdk and now ub  who knows what the next flavor of the month will be.   but some things like debian slackware and gentoo are well established with their own special claims to fame.
