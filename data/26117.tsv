2012-09-18T20:32:00.000Z	cyclist_2		Hello, there! what is your opinion so far about 12.04.1 regarding speed; I have it installed on a VirtualBox and is very slow; I have not yet tried it on a live session; for instance, opening a .small odf spreadsheet with LibreOffice is almost painfully slow, as it is using the Ubuntu Software Centre
2012-09-18T20:33:00.000Z	bazhang	cyclist_2	what is the issue? a vbox is slower than a livecd, which is slower than an install
2012-09-18T20:34:00.000Z	bazhang	cyclist_2	please state your exact issue and dont poll
2012-09-18T20:43:00.000Z	cyclist_2	bazhang	I have other Guest Operating Systems running on VirtualBox, so I **know** how they behave compared to the real thing; if you do not want to answer, would it not be simpler to say nothing, instead of trying to behave like an Operator?
