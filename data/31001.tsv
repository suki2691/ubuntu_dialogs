2010-05-30T16:36:00.000Z	guntbert	Semperfi30	its the channel's rule to keep discussions to ubuntu support only - so please adhere to that and don't discuss other topics
2010-05-30T16:39:00.000Z	Semperfi30	guntbert	I've been here for technical support up until you started to decide what topics are and aren't considered to be of a technical support matter. Of which I must respectfully disagree as I've been on the "technical support" state of mind since I joined this channel. But, I digress. I'm moving on now. Continue pointing out non technical support topics if you wish though. I will go elsewhere with my questions if necessary.
