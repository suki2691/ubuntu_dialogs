2005-03-20T16:00:00.000Z	hyphen		hah!  got my hard drive working!
2005-03-20T16:00:00.000Z	hyphen		now i have another problem though :(
2005-03-20T16:02:00.000Z	hyphen		i'm dual booting linux and winxp, but at startup i don't get a os select prompt, it just asks if i want to boot winxp pro, anyone know why?
2005-03-20T16:03:00.000Z	mlambie	hyphen	does it boot straight into windows, or does  GRUB prompt you for the OS and there's no Ubuntu listed?
