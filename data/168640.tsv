2008-10-19T08:54:00.000Z	scunizi	ronzilla	virtualbox is good but get it from their site if you're going to install.. also vmware is good but there are 2 versions.. 1.x.x and 2.x.x beta.. I've used both and prefer 2.x.x because it gives me access to the vm from any other machine without having to install anything else on the other machines..
