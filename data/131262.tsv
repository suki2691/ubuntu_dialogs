2009-12-15T18:15:00.000Z	Ramosa		About partitioning: I have a netbook with 160GB harddisk.. 6GB partition exists with a windows recover. The rest of the space I want to divide about half'n'half for UNR and a possible future OS. So about 75GB partition for UNR.. but I need 2 partitions right? File system and SWAP .. Filesystem should be what? ext3? and swap? and what about primary and logical

2009-12-15T18:16:00.000Z	Ramosa	Emanon	be prudent? that doesn't help much :)
2009-12-15T18:26:00.000Z	Ramosa	Emanon	no clue how to make a boot partition or LVM2.. but I know that the restore partition is linked to the netbooks BIOS.. i press f4 during startup to boot that one
