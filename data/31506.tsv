2010-05-23T17:54:00.000Z	metric1983	tyranos	do you know of a way to test my graphics card to see if it is working, it might just not be good enough for latest wow though i know it has worked perfectly for burning crusade
2010-05-23T17:56:00.000Z	tyranos	metric1983	u can try and install alien-arena , nexuiz, or one of the other egoshooter opensource games and see how that goes, u can download them from the ubuntu software center
