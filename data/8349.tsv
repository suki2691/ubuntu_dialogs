2012-09-23T16:08:00.000Z	Benxyzzy	akis	You mean you want a button in gnome that fires a terminal command?
2012-09-23T16:22:00.000Z	akis	Benxyzzy	i mean i want to run an application through terminal but just clicking on the application's icon, like it is possible in xubuntu with a right click on the application's icon and choosing 'run form a terminal'
2012-09-23T16:27:00.000Z	Benxyzzy	akis	Hm, I would create a new launcher (shortcut) and add the command there: http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/GNOME.html#LAUNCHER
