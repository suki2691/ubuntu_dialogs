2009-10-18T03:31:00.000Z	mstk		I'm having some problems installing ubuntu onto an old computer that was reformatted ages ago and just lying around.  It doesn't seem to be able to boot from USB and the CD drive doesn't even seem to be connected, despite having power
2009-10-18T03:31:00.000Z	mstk		are there any alternative installation options?
2009-10-18T03:33:00.000Z	mstk		none of them work
2009-10-18T03:34:00.000Z	log`	mstk	sometimes external usb drives aren't under the usb-hdd option but need to be configured as a hard drive
