2012-09-19T03:37:00.000Z	mrgt_	TJ-	I guessed as much :( I really don't want to go back to MS Project. I used it for a group project last year and it almost drove me insane!
2012-09-19T03:41:00.000Z	mrgt_	TJ-	Thanks. I was looking for a gui  interface because I'll need to submit evidence of work to my supervisor.
2012-09-19T03:47:00.000Z	mrgt_	TJ-	yeah. Something to consider. Might be fun to contribute to something like that.
