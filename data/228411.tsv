2005-07-18T14:05:00.000Z	n1k0		backports...I don't even use them.
2005-07-18T14:06:00.000Z	eliUbuntu	n1k0	why not use the backports?
2005-07-18T14:07:00.000Z	eliUbuntu		is there a drop shadow option to add to ubuntu?
2005-07-18T14:07:00.000Z	n1k0	eliUbuntu	I don't see any point to use them. I do not need the latest software.
