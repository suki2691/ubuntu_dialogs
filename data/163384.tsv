2006-12-13T15:23:00.000Z	scorp123		Am I right to assume that I can ask some stupid questions about Ubuntu here?  :-)
2006-12-13T15:24:00.000Z	scorp123		OK -- has anyone had their PS/2 keyboard freeze after system startup? Symptoms: The PS/2 keyboard will not react at all, it takes 2-3 reboots until it reacts ....  Anyone had this too?
