2008-09-01T08:50:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Merther	 i do not think thats possible.. grub can only see what the bios sees. I belive...
2008-09-01T08:51:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Merther	 i could be wrong.. the PuppyLinux forums I think had a thread or 2 on this topic.. and possible work arounds
2008-09-01T08:53:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Merther	 i would think it may need more then just a bios update.. also Openbios only works on specific machines last i looked.
