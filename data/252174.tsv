2005-01-27T12:45:00.000Z	TraceyTux		I'm having a 2nd hard disk put in my computer soon - I'll be using it for Ubuntu. I was wondering if it'd be OK for the new HDD to be slave to my original HDD, which will be Windows-only, and Grub to be in the MBR?

2005-01-27T12:47:00.000Z	aethera	TraceyTux	than no need to worry :)
