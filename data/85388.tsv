2008-08-05T14:26:00.000Z	debCarlos	conb123	Did you searched in google, i think that many people have actually that kind of prob, maybe someone did a how to :D
2008-08-05T14:27:00.000Z	conb123	debCarlos	i cant think what to search for to get results though
2008-08-05T14:28:00.000Z	debCarlos	conb123	me too, maybe in launchpad you can search something like "sound won't start since i installed graphic drivers" :D
