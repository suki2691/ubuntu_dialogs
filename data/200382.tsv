2006-04-21T05:48:00.000Z	david_		does anyone know where I can find a driver for a lexmark P4350 for ubuntu?

2006-04-21T05:53:00.000Z	Drac[Server] 	david_	you ought to ask around about Lexmark's quality and reconsider what you just said. Regardless, there are few Lexmark drivers out there. Like I said, it's possible that somebody might have developed one, but since Lexmark only recently started releasing open source drivers, you're probably not going to find one very easily.
