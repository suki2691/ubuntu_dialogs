2012-05-08T03:27:00.000Z	PhotoJim		I'm not being offered an upgrade to precise (12.04LTS) from lucid (10.04LTS).  if I tell Update Manager to show all upgrade versions, it wants to upgrade to 10.10 but I'd rather do an LTS-to-LTS upgrade.  am I missing something.
2012-05-08T03:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PhotoJim	youo won't until 12.04.1 is out
2012-05-08T03:28:00.000Z	PhotoJim	ActionParsnip	oh, okay.  so this is normal behaviour. :)
2012-05-08T03:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PhotoJim	indeed, you can force the upgrade if you want
