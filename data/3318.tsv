2012-05-03T07:11:00.000Z	cg2916		I have tried 2 methods of creating a live USB (LiLi and Universal USB Installer) but both get stuck right at the beginning of booting
2012-05-03T07:12:00.000Z	wile-nilee	cg2916	is stuck a black screen?
2012-05-03T07:13:00.000Z	cg2916	wile-nilee	mostly black with the SYSLINUX "credits" header
2012-05-03T07:15:00.000Z	wile-nilee	cg2916	hmm at times there are graphic card drivers that are not there and nomodeset is chosen from a f6 prompt at the try or install memory check gui, not sure that is your problem but thought it might help to know.
