2006-10-17T12:29:00.000Z	volvoguy		howdy folks, quick question. i need to build a server this week (before friday). it's not super critical, but used often. would you recommend dapper still or go with edgy this close to the release?
2006-10-17T12:30:00.000Z	ArrenLex	volvoguy	for a server? I would go for the stable distribution for a server.
2006-10-17T12:31:00.000Z	volvoguy	ArrenLex	even this close to the next release? in a few weeks wouldn't the upgrade to edgy be easier from edgy than dapper?
2006-10-17T12:32:00.000Z	volvoguy	ArrenLex	because my 2.4 server crashes like hell.
