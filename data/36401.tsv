2010-03-03T03:48:00.000Z	michael__		I cannot run Compiz because I am receiving the error advanced desktop effects could not be enabled. Can anybody help?
2010-03-03T03:48:00.000Z	serverduck	michael__	 Did you checked hardware drivers?
2010-03-03T03:49:00.000Z	serverduck	michael__	 Be patient, there are a lot of people here asking for help. Helpers are no gods :)
2010-03-03T03:49:00.000Z	michael__	serverduck	I tried using the FGLRX drivers but uninstalled them via the direction of another user and installed the ATI drivers from the ATI website. Which aren't working with Compiz either.
