2012-02-21T23:05:00.000Z	bellman		i have read that there is a new security exploit in sudo. how do you replace this feature with a safer form of root access.? i just want to be able to ssh -l root   or su -l
2012-02-21T23:06:00.000Z	bellman		!root
2012-02-21T23:08:00.000Z	bellman		so the ubuntu installer picks a very safe long and non guessable root pass phrase?
