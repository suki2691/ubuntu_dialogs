2009-10-28T08:46:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Mike999	what worked for me was using the nvidia config tool to create the xorg file, and then saving that manually.  Ubuntuforums.org helped me with the rest.
2009-10-28T08:48:00.000Z	Mike999	Jeruvy	I'll check that out, I've been using the GUI NVIDIA X Server Settings app you think I should switch to nvidia-config?
