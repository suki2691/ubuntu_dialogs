2012-11-05T04:04:00.000Z	dw-		How do I update Chrome beyond 18.x.  Ubuntu won't let me, and Google Drive keeps giving a warning message about out of date.  It's annoying.

2012-11-05T04:06:00.000Z	trism	dw-	sorry no, it is in precise-updates now
2012-11-05T04:06:00.000Z	trism	dw-	do you not have -updates enabled?
