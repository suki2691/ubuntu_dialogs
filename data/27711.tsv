2011-09-12T22:46:00.000Z	Chariblaze		I want to set up a triple-boot Windows/two Linux distros machine, and I came across a slight snag: Is the general recommendation to make a partition for GRUB, or to let it overwrite the MBR?

2011-09-12T22:55:00.000Z	Onyx47	Chariblaze	it's no big deal, there's also instructions on how to do it all over the net
2011-09-12T22:56:00.000Z	Chariblaze	Onyx47	Ah, thanks much. Sounds good.
