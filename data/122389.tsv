2009-06-22T07:33:00.000Z	shaffy		can someone help:  i am trying to restore my grub boot menu (installed windows7 dual boot) through the  live cd.  at the grub terminal i type "fine /boot/grub/stage1" and i get "error 15: file not found."  any ideas anyone?

2009-06-22T07:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	shaffy	 you did use 'find' right? :)
2009-06-22T07:36:00.000Z	shaffy	Dr_Willis	tabbing yields: "error  12: ivnalid device requested" and find stage1 yields "error 11: unrecognized device string"  and how could i be using "find" incorrectly?  ^_^
