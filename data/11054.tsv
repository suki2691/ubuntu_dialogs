2011-08-13T13:17:00.000Z	ironm		good morning. Can you give your point of view about pros and contras when using CentOS or ubuntu / debian as production servers? - Thank you in advance for any hints.
2011-08-13T13:18:00.000Z	vsync	ironm	think i'd go with debian. stable as hell, repos have a bit outdated software, but it doesn't matter that much on a production server
2011-08-13T13:20:00.000Z	ironm	vsync	squeeze has quite outdated packages
2011-08-13T13:21:00.000Z	ironm	vsync	I don't have any experience if ubuntu handle it better
