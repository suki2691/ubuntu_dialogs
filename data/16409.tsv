2011-04-30T03:25:00.000Z	[snake]		Can I use different languages (in this case hebrew, which must go right to left) in the terminal?

2011-04-30T03:28:00.000Z	[snake]	Kevin`	I see what you mean... I found a multi-lingual terminal, but it is too simple and I don't know how to make it left to right.
2011-04-30T03:29:00.000Z	[snake]	Kevin`	I meant right to left :P
