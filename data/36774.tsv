2010-02-23T09:00:00.000Z	rss-staff		anybody? uvcvideo missing some controls - they are there in 9.04, gone in 9.10

2010-02-23T09:03:00.000Z	rss-staff	Lonniebiz	actually, my question is much more complex than that. In 9.04 the camera works and has all the appropriate controls. In 9.10 it is missing white balance temperature.
