2008-05-06T04:07:00.000Z	TaRDy		if my drive is already partitioned am i too late to resize it?
2008-05-06T04:07:00.000Z	TaRDy		thank you IdleOne I'll look into that
2008-05-06T04:09:00.000Z	IdleOne	TaRDy	I had a similar issue when trying the livecd and that helped me out but if you say it is when installing I am not certain how to help
2008-05-06T04:09:00.000Z	TaRDy	IdleOne	I haven't tried to do any repartitioning I just want to redo it with my root as a separate one I have heard it makes upgrading easier
