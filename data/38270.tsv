2010-06-28T08:14:00.000Z	astropirate		I want to expand my ubuntu partition (ext4) to take up some space from my windows partition, I don't care if i lose data on the windows partition but i want to NOT lose anything on my linux partition. Can i do this with gparted?
2010-06-28T08:16:00.000Z	astropirate		or do i need a dedicated gparted live cd
