2012-01-07T03:33:00.000Z	fwpc		could somebody help with gufw configuration? i want to block all outgoing traffic except the one i whitelist. set Outgoing: Deny and added ALLOW OUT rule for HTTP but firefox won't open sites.
2012-01-07T03:34:00.000Z	jstoone	fwpc	May I ask why you want to do this?
2012-01-07T03:35:00.000Z	fwpc	jstoone	mainly because i like to keep open only those ports i use. i know that it might make little difference in case of malware presence.
2012-01-07T03:43:00.000Z	fwpc	jstoone	you happen to know how to configure gufw to only allow whitelisted outgoing traffic?
