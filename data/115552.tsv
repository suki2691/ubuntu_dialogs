2007-10-22T21:47:00.000Z	dwezel		could someone please tell me what file holds the resolutions available for X?
2007-10-22T21:48:00.000Z	dwezel		when I change the resolution it wont hold after a reboot even if I check the default box
2007-10-22T21:50:00.000Z	dwezel		is there a way to change the screen resolution other than the Set Screen Resolution X app?
