2005-08-05T13:12:00.000Z	shammy		I've been unsuccessfully trying to uninstall linux for the last week or so now.. i've tried fedora, ubuntu, and vidalinux and cannot get xserver configured on any of them.. Is there a distro that is likely to work, or something i can do to fix my ubuntu install that is currenly on my slave hd?

2005-08-05T13:13:00.000Z	shammy	persi1	i'll start the live cd torrent now
2005-08-05T13:20:00.000Z	persi1	shammy	that should work.  Also, I've forgotten the details, but you can reset the xorg MD5sum for dpkg-reconfigure somehow.  My apologies I have not been able to find it.
