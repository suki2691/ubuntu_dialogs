2007-08-26T08:13:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder		I used source-o-matic thingy, but I am still getting "Package linux-image-2.6.20-16-generic is not available, but is referred to by another package." Do I need to tell source-o-matic that I am using feisty instead even though I am using edgy?
2007-08-26T08:15:00.000Z	Pici	CorpseFeeder	what are you trying to do?
2007-08-26T08:15:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	Pici	trying to upgrade edgy to feisty.
2007-08-26T08:16:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	Pici	I originally tried using the "upgrade" button in software update, but that just f'ed up my whole system...
