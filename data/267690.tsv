2009-09-05T07:44:00.000Z	blue0488		should I go with 32 bit ubuntu or 64 bit I can run 64 bit but is it really worth it?
2009-09-05T07:44:00.000Z	Nafai	blue0488	How much memory do you have?
2009-09-05T07:44:00.000Z	Nafai	blue0488	And do you have a 64-bit capable machine, should probably be the first question.
2009-09-05T07:46:00.000Z	Nafai	blue0488	You can't see all 4gb without the 64-bit.  I've had a few little problems here and there, mostly related to proprietary stuff that isn't 64-bit
