2006-02-24T13:51:00.000Z	cramop		hi, I know this may not be the exact place to ask but, I am planning to buy a mini dv camcorder with firewire output. Will I be abe to copy the whole movie as a file? or will I have to copy it in analog mode?
2006-02-24T13:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cramop	 should be able to get it into a file with digital transfer.
2006-02-24T13:53:00.000Z	cramop	Dr_Willis	do I have to play the tape on the camcorder side in realtime?
