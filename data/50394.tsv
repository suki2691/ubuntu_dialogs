2010-03-08T01:27:00.000Z	losher	dehqan	usually, apt-get won't re-download something if it is already in  /var/cache/apt/archives
2010-03-08T01:34:00.000Z	dehqan	losher	are you sure ? but here it is going to redownload
2010-03-08T01:36:00.000Z	losher	dehqan	I thought I was sure, but if you know differently...
