2011-01-13T19:59:00.000Z	bars0		Hi all! I have a question: Am I need to install grub if I plan to do standalone installation? Until today I have had always Linux and Windows side by side.
2011-01-13T20:00:00.000Z	akssps011	bars0	isn't grub the default bootloader ? ;)
2011-01-13T20:01:00.000Z	bars0	akssps011	so bootloader is obligatory? Even if there's only one system on the machine?
2011-01-13T20:02:00.000Z	akssps011	bars0	in generaly, yes
