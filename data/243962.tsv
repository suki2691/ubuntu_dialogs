2005-04-02T07:41:00.000Z	kent		btw, will performance decrease alot if i disable dma on the ide? I got some strange errors from the drive last night and thought I might try if something happens if U turn of dma.  (Like, will the dvd-burner become *slow* or something).

2005-04-02T07:41:00.000Z	stazz	kent	and yes, performance will plummet
