2006-01-21T06:29:00.000Z	Kyral		I have been using Dapper since the repos opened ;P
2006-01-21T06:30:00.000Z	Kyral		Then again if something breaks, I find it a learning experiance fixing it ;P
2006-01-21T06:31:00.000Z	marcin	Kyral	sure... and I had dapper on my second machine because I just like to use something "fresh" but I also would like to help in development - reporting bugs etc.
2006-01-21T06:31:00.000Z	marcin	Kyral	but currently I have to give up because I just cannot boot dapper ;>
