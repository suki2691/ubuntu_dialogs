2006-12-25T14:17:00.000Z	strabes	VerdRousseau	yes - http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/kde
2006-12-25T14:17:00.000Z	strabes	VerdRousseau	no; KDE apps look a lot different. you can use gnome apps in kde and kde apps in gnome but they look bad
2006-12-25T14:20:00.000Z	strabes	VerdRousseau	you can have both kde and gnome installed on your computer at the same time. you just log into separate sessions
