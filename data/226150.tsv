2007-09-13T06:12:00.000Z	muNkey_boy		I was just wondering, would Ubuntu be anygood for running a file server and media box?
2007-09-13T06:13:00.000Z	muNkey_boy		All I will need on the file server is support for a FTP server and HDD support. And I'm pretty sure that VLC Media player runs on Ubuntu.
2007-09-13T06:13:00.000Z	vader1102	muNkey_boy	no idea. Someone with a little more experience will have to help there
