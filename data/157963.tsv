2009-06-21T02:02:00.000Z	gangil		hi I had a problem with SDLNet_SocketReady(sock)
2009-06-21T02:03:00.000Z	gangil		can anybody help me with this , in the docs it is said to find whether a socket is active or not?
2009-06-21T02:03:00.000Z	gangil		what does *active means here?
2009-06-21T02:04:00.000Z	Slart	gangil	probably means an app of some kind is listening on the socket.
