2006-10-05T08:38:00.000Z	w30	Djuuss	I read that writing to ntfs with Linux over networking is flaky. I don't know the particulars though.
2006-10-05T08:39:00.000Z	Djuuss	w30	that doesnt make sense, you dont write over network directly onto the harddisk, you present the data to the receiving machine, that writes it to HD all by itself. So i dont see how linux ntfs compatibility has anything to do with that
