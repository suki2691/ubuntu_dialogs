2007-10-07T15:17:00.000Z	_MrPink_		Did I understand it correctly, that it is easier to install windows first and then ubuntu (because the grub menu is erased if you install windows after ubuntu ) ?
2007-10-07T15:17:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	_MrPink_	yep
2007-10-07T15:18:00.000Z	_MrPink_	FurryNemesis	 ok thanks... I think once 7.10 is officially released I will just do a system kill and reinstall windows and linux on one day ;)
