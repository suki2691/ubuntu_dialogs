2010-03-15T20:25:00.000Z	Grey_Loki		Hi, two questions - i'm just 'installing' UrT, where's the best place to put the directory full of game-files and the launcher itself, preferably so it can be executed from a terminal/launcher in the same way stuff like 'xterm' or 'firefox' can be?
2010-03-15T20:26:00.000Z	Grey_Loki		Secondly, on a similar note, how can I create a launcher that will launch a terminal and run a specific command (in this case, ssh to my local server)?
2010-03-15T20:27:00.000Z	Slart	Grey_Loki	for the second question. check out the "gnome-terminal" command.. there is a switch for a command to run
