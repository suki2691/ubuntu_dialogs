2006-12-13T17:05:00.000Z	ailean		okay, i want to install anti-virus and i use AVG on windows. there is a linux version in rpm form - should i use it or is there an alternative?

2006-12-13T17:07:00.000Z	weswh-	ailean	maybe i'm just in the dark, but i don't even know of a so-called "anti virus" app for linux. avg for linux? ok..fair enough. guess i'll look into it for myself.
