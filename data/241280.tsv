2005-09-03T14:58:00.000Z	dirkhaim		any one has any idea if there's a way to install ubunbtu on a mac mini without erasing all the existing data? I already have a linux partition with Yellow Dog Linux, and I want to overwrite it, but keep all the data on the other partitions
2005-09-03T14:59:00.000Z	dirkhaim		I will see that option during the install? cool
2005-09-03T14:59:00.000Z	rob^	dirkhaim	next time have a /home partition
