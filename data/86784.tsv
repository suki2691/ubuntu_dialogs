2011-09-15T19:07:00.000Z	mndo		hi! what is the right procedure to update a deb file with the latest upstream version?
2011-09-15T19:08:00.000Z	bastidrazor	mndo	wait for it to be released in the repository.
2011-09-15T19:08:00.000Z	mndo		apt-source + uupdate + dpkg-buildpackage is failing on me
2011-09-15T19:09:00.000Z	mndo	bastidrazor	that's not an option, i need the bugfixes and features of the new version
