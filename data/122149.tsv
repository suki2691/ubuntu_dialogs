2009-07-13T05:46:00.000Z	fwaokda		is there a program that will rename a bunch of files for me? I want to add a prefix to a bunch of files... ???
2009-07-13T05:46:00.000Z	mattgyver	fwaokda	i think its called batch rename
2009-07-13T05:47:00.000Z	fwaokda	mattgyver	thats the name of a program or is that like something built into ubuntu and I just do a command?
2009-07-13T05:47:00.000Z	mattgyver	fwaokda	i dont think its installed by default.  search the repos, aptitude search rename
