2009-02-05T07:09:00.000Z	Cyberai		I just bought a new monitor that says it's max native resolution is 1920x1200. But I can't get the monitor to that res. Both the ubuntu monitor res app and the nvidia X Server Settings app say the max res is 1600x1200. Can anyone help?
2009-02-05T07:10:00.000Z	ruediix	Cyberai	your video card might not support the resolution (some nvidia cards don't support over 1600x1200 due to the hack they use to handle full screen antialiasing.)
2009-02-05T07:15:00.000Z	ruediix	Cyberai	you could just run at a lower resolution, but I recommend using one that is the right ratio.
2009-02-05T07:15:00.000Z	Cyberai	ruediix	yeah, I'm doing graphics work in GIMP. I need native res
