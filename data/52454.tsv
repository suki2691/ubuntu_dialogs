2009-07-18T09:46:00.000Z	masterchild		can ubuntu be updated from like jaunty to karmic without having to reinstall everything all over? I recently installed ubuntu to completely transition from windows.
2009-07-18T09:47:00.000Z	Kalmi_	masterchild	yes... but don't upgrade to karmic yet! karmic is not ready yet....
2009-07-18T09:48:00.000Z	Kalmi_		!karmic
2009-07-18T09:48:00.000Z	masterchild	Kalmi_	okay, I was just wondering since I don't want to have to clear out all my stuff once karmic is done
