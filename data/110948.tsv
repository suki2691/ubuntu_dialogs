2010-07-07T00:47:00.000Z	CppIsWeird		i just tried installing ubuntu-xen-server and it says it cant be installed because one of its dependencies cannot be found, xen-tools.
2010-07-07T00:48:00.000Z	h00k	CppIsWeird	can you install xen-tools first? What are you using to install?
2010-07-07T00:49:00.000Z	h00k	CppIsWeird	try 'sudo aptitude install ubuntu-xen-server'
2010-07-07T00:49:00.000Z	h00k	CppIsWeird	from a terminal
