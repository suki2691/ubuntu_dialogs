2010-11-04T05:53:00.000Z	philsf		I upgraded my netbook from lucid->maverick in the beta phase, and a friend's netbook after final release. When she opens the applications screen, she has a "recently used apps"section, I don't have. What should I do to make it appear?

2010-11-04T05:55:00.000Z	wliao	philsf	sorry. of course not.
