2006-04-26T06:31:00.000Z	slackern	arrick	you could try  "sudo apt-get -s install libapache-mod-frontpage-mirfak" to simulate the install then you see what it will install also.
2006-04-26T06:31:00.000Z	arrick	slackern	I already did the install, I was needing to knwo if I had to config anything before using it
2006-04-26T06:32:00.000Z	slackern	arrick	Oh that i have no idea about, i just set up my apache with php5 and all was configured for me
