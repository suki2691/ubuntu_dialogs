2006-01-13T09:33:00.000Z	req		Just a question from a newbie.. I installed ubuntu for the first time a while ago but it was an old version.Trying to update I managed to brake it. Can I just pop the new version cd in and install over this one so that my files stay intact? That seems to be the easiest way

2006-01-13T09:36:00.000Z	req		I'll try to keep an eye on making /home into it's own partition next time I install
