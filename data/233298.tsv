2005-06-14T14:38:00.000Z	MrDataNet		How can I turn off daemons? Things start up automatically when I boot, and I would like to turn them off, but I have no idea how. I think they're daemons. I tried an uninstall of Zope, and it is now only partially uninstalled. I think daemons are the problem? Someone put a bug note here: https://launchpad.ubuntu.com/malone/tasks/651/
2005-06-14T14:39:00.000Z	MrDataNet		I think I now have a partial uninstall. I haven't restarted the machine.
2005-06-14T14:39:00.000Z	MrDataNet		I don't want it broken, though? I'd like to uninstall, then reinstall the latest version from Zope's Web site.
