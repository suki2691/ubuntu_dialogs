2011-05-11T04:14:00.000Z	Travis-42		ok.. this is odd, how do I get into the live session? I downloaded and burned Ubuntu 11.04 64-bit to a CD, but there is no "try ubuntu" option. is that new/normal?
2011-05-11T04:15:00.000Z	KM0201	Travis-42	when you installed, did you actually install from from a live session? or did you use the "install inside windows" option?
2011-05-11T04:16:00.000Z	Travis-42	KM0201	neither, I choose "Install Ubuntu" from the CD
2011-05-11T04:16:00.000Z	KM0201	Travis-42	so. (again, just to be clear).. you inserted the CD.. and rebooted, let the CD boot, and got a option to "install ubuntu"
