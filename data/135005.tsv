2007-10-31T22:23:00.000Z	jhattu		A stupid question about pidgin: When I block someone, do he/she get a message that I blocked him/her?
2007-10-31T22:24:00.000Z	aninhumer	jhattu	it may depend on protocol too?
2007-10-31T22:24:00.000Z	jhattu	aninhumer	I wish to block people from MSN ;-)
2007-10-31T22:25:00.000Z	aninhumer	jhattu	yeah, with MSN they just won't see that you're online, although it may not make a difference with protocol
