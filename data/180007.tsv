2006-12-17T14:31:00.000Z	Joakim		I have a problem. When I opens a program, for example, Gaim. If I have some other program open, Gaim will lay under all of the other programs. So, to get Gaim on the top, I need to click on it on the panel. It some kind of minimized when I opens it. Somebody know how to fix this?
