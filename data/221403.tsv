2008-01-22T06:09:00.000Z	nickrud	Smegzor	the ones you mount with Places are sort of virtual mounts, only apps that use the gnome virtual file system can see those, like gedit, the pdf viewer, and some others
2008-01-22T06:09:00.000Z	Smegzor	nickrud	yeah I figured that.  oh well.. I'll just have to use different tools for some things.
