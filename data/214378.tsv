2006-06-02T07:34:00.000Z	BetteS		HI Im having trouble with extremely high CPU usage after upgrading
2006-06-02T07:36:00.000Z	BetteS		running top does not show a process eating CPU... but my desklet says that the CPU usage is 50-80%
2006-06-02T07:36:00.000Z	ljlolel	BetteS	maybe the desklet is eating 80% ;-)
2006-06-02T07:38:00.000Z	ljlolel	BetteS	i was joking, um.. did you try a reboot?
