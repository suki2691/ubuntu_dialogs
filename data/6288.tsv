2012-02-14T03:39:00.000Z	jbbarnes		My ubuntu server is in bad shape. A rebuilt can't wait until 12.04 is released. Can I install the current 12.04 build and run an update once it is officially released?
2012-02-14T03:41:00.000Z	zykotic10	jbbarnes	you can update to final, once it's released.  support in #ubuntu+1 though.
2012-02-14T03:44:00.000Z	jbbarnes	zykotic10	Is #ubuntu+1 a separate channel for ubuntu server, or ubuntu alpha releases, or what?
2012-02-14T03:44:00.000Z	zykotic10	jbbarnes	it's for alpha/beta stuff, server has a different channel
