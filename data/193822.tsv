2006-09-20T05:35:00.000Z	calloc		If I have say 5 windows machines on a small wireless network and I then have an ubuntu box, that inet connection shares to another windows box - How can I let all clients on the network access media on the windows box behind the Ubuntu box, or is it really worth the hassle??

2006-09-20T05:40:00.000Z	calloc	aimaz	Is that straight forward enough to do??
2006-09-20T05:40:00.000Z	calloc	aimaz	wouldnt there be a whole load of windows ports I need to allow etc?? where would you start..
