2011-05-31T18:22:00.000Z	archuser2		hi everybody. Can I make USB loadable distro using something like sudo dd if=ubuntu-10.04.2-desktop-i386.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4096?
2011-05-31T18:23:00.000Z	DasEi	archuser2	use unetbootin, dd only woks for some isos
2011-05-31T18:26:00.000Z	DasEi	archuser2	you can, but why ? unetbootin rruns fine , both linux and win
2011-05-31T18:28:00.000Z	archuser2	DasEi	oh come on, if you can do it without installing anything, why should I install it? I don't believe that I'll be using it every day.
