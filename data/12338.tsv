2011-10-24T04:24:00.000Z	lafon		is there anyway to upgrade from lucid to oneric?
2011-10-24T04:24:00.000Z	zykotick9	lafon	lucid->maverick->natty->oneric (you can't skip) -- i'd strongly suggest fresh installing
2011-10-24T04:25:00.000Z	lafon	zykotick9	oh ok, besides copying the home folder is there anyway to keep the data?
2011-10-24T04:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	lafon	even the settings in you home directory COULD cause issues...
