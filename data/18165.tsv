2011-02-14T18:41:00.000Z	bigmahatma		I have a ADSL connection, which goes to a modem/router, which goes to a switch, and finally to ca. 10 PCs. How can I measure the amount of traffic coming and going tto/from each PC? NB. I have admin access to everything, I'd rather not to install SW on the PCs, and the router hasn't got such a function..

2011-02-14T18:42:00.000Z	bigmahatma	Pumpkin-	no :(
