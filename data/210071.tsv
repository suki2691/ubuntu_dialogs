2007-10-24T02:52:00.000Z	tamale		please help me uninstall the new 8.42.3 ati fglrx driver.  i can't login at all (not even failsafe session) because compiz tries to load and i get a white screen of death.
2007-10-24T02:54:00.000Z	Samuli^	tamale	wouldn't just renaming "Driver" fglrx to "ati" in the xorg.conf do the trick?
2007-10-24T02:54:00.000Z	tamale	Samuli^	I was using fglrx before too, not the open source ati driver
2007-10-24T02:55:00.000Z	Samuli^	tamale	so you want revert to the old drivers?
