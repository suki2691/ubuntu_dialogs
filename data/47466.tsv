2012-04-30T22:25:00.000Z	Zzarkc		Hello. So I was recently attempting to update to 12.04, and while I was doing so, my computer crashed. When I restarted, it wasn't allowing me to complete the boot process. I have an 11.10 install cd that I can boot from, but I was wondering how I might save my information, such as my installed programs, my software sources, and information on my /home. I did separate my /home partition, but I don't know how to make the new installation
2012-04-30T22:25:00.000Z	Zzarkc		"find it" without overwriting it. Thanks!
2012-04-30T22:25:00.000Z	theadmin	Zzarkc	Just point /home to that partition during the install, without formatting it
2012-04-30T22:27:00.000Z	theadmin	Zzarkc	dpkg --get-selections I suppose.
