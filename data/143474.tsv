2010-01-08T12:14:00.000Z	Organizm	Muskat33r	if i had 4GB, i probably wouldn't bother.
2010-01-08T12:16:00.000Z	Organizm	Muskat33r	i have those partitions because they're on physically separate hard drives.  i have a two disk mirror for each of those mount points.
2010-01-08T12:17:00.000Z	Organizm	Muskat33r	nope.  my video card is louder than my hard drives.
