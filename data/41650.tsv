I have a problem booting, processes freeze, a kind of weird dialogue for restoration is being called, but has no permitions, can't get to logon, splash freezes and echoes "ubuntu is running in low graphics mode, error: no /something/fs0 directory found"...

2009-12-02T15:30:00.000Z	Consul_Falx	ikonia	kubuntu boot splash crashes, switching to low graphics mode, with an error message that some directory /???/fs0 can't be open, because doesnt exist... i have to switch to an other TTY, press ctrl c and use prompt... then, I'm allowed to start xserver actually...
