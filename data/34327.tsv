2010-04-29T10:20:00.000Z	hunahpu	Albi_	having 64-bit software allows you to run more apps at the same time actually.....

2010-04-29T10:27:00.000Z	Albi_	hunahpu	it may allow you to run more processors but it does not allow you to run more programs because barely anybody is coding for 64bit, if you want to rewrite every program that you want to install to run 64bit go ahead and install it
