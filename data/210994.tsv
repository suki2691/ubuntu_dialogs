2007-07-03T15:38:00.000Z	predaeus	michas	should work here too, but I messed around a lot with these.
2007-07-03T15:40:00.000Z	michas	predaeus	the reconfigure in ubuntu just generates the locales, but does not allow to choose them.
2007-07-03T15:41:00.000Z	predaeus	michas	hm look for what update-<tab> programs there are.
