2009-03-25T16:29:00.000Z	beli	ecret	depends on the other rules you have and where it appears...check with  iptables -L
2009-03-25T16:29:00.000Z	ecret	beli	no rules there specifically turn off ports, so will it all be open?
2009-03-25T16:30:00.000Z	beli	ecret	should....just enter the rule and verify with iptables -L
