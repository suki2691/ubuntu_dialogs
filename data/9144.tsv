2011-10-05T20:27:00.000Z	cdcdabba	w30	 Its not completely necessary, I just want to charge something without it getting detected by the computer.  Didn't want to have to use something else since the computer's usb port is right here
2011-10-05T20:27:00.000Z	w30	cdcdabba	I just spent $24 at Wal Mart for a pack of cigarette lighter and house wall socket usb chargers
2011-10-05T20:30:00.000Z	w30	cdcdabba	and if it blows up I am out $24 and not $600 + for a computer, well maybe an extension cord also.
