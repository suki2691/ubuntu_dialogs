2006-08-25T09:24:00.000Z	phoghawk		Hey, this may be a retarded question but... How do I check which version (32 or 64 bit) of Ubuntu I have installed?
2006-08-25T09:25:00.000Z	lampshade	phoghawk	you can go to a command line and try uname -a   and see if it mentions anything about it there
2006-08-25T09:25:00.000Z	phoghawk	lampshade	nope. anymore ideas?
2006-08-25T09:28:00.000Z	lampshade	phoghawk	I'm pretty sure you have 32 bit installed.  otherwise the uname -a I told you would have mentioned it
