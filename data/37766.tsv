2011-04-20T05:43:00.000Z	witeshark		 so i have a question about elevated privileges from update manager: if the icon does not turn off in panel, the elevation is still present right?
2011-04-20T05:44:00.000Z	ohsix	witeshark	you mean the key? it just means while its there additional prompts will automatically succeed
2011-04-20T05:45:00.000Z	ohsix	witeshark	which is usually desirable, but the icon is in the tray so you can click it and lock it up tight again immediately
2011-04-20T05:45:00.000Z	witeshark	ohsix	okay thanks
