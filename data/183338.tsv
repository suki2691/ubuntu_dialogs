2007-11-22T07:10:00.000Z	Eko_Hermiyanto		I have strange problem upon wireless network. I have two laptops. One is using Ubuntu and another is using Microsoft Windows. Both of them can be connected through wireless network. Both of them able to get the right ip address, netmask address, default gateway, and dns server. but why the one with Ubuntu able to go to the net, and the other one could not go to the net?
