2007-12-06T07:32:00.000Z	firefly2442		Is there a way I can MD5sum an entire directory and get back one value for the whole directory?
2007-12-06T07:32:00.000Z	MasterShrek	firefly2442	i doubt it, compress it to a tar.bz2 or something then md5sum it
2007-12-06T07:34:00.000Z	firefly2442	MasterShrek	yeah, it sort of defeats the purpose though, I just want to check if two directories are the same without using diff
2007-12-06T07:35:00.000Z	MasterShrek	firefly2442	what you got against diff?
