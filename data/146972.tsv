2007-04-07T13:25:00.000Z	Trist_an		hey, I was just wondering if it is possible to open an image inside the terminal? Like you can open a movie with mplayer and libcaca library
2007-04-07T13:25:00.000Z	EdgEy	Trist_an	it's not really inside the terminal with mplayer
2007-04-07T13:25:00.000Z	EdgEy		it's as inside the terminal as running xchat from term would be, it attaches to X
2007-04-07T13:26:00.000Z	Trist_an	EdgEy	yes that's not in the terminal but you know what I mean
