2008-12-04T09:55:00.000Z	funkja		I'm trying to create an iso from a cd using 'dd', but a couple mbs into the cd it gives an I/O error and exits. I assume the disk is scratched or something. Is there anything I can do to create one?

2008-12-04T09:58:00.000Z	funkja	joeb3_	hm, i guess I didn't think of that
2008-12-04T09:58:00.000Z	funkja	joeb3_	that is entirely possible - darn.
