2012-02-18T01:09:00.000Z	cypher-neo		I have a question. Will uninstalling gnome-session mess anything up? I don't want to use fallback mode anymore, and I'm having issues with nautilus so i was planning on uninstalling both of those. Will this break Unity or GNOME Shell?
2012-02-18T01:10:00.000Z	loganrun	cypher-neo	do you have unity installed?
2012-02-18T01:10:00.000Z	cypher-neo	loganrun	I do, but I don't use it. I use GNOME Shell for everything.
2012-02-18T01:12:00.000Z	cypher-neo	loganrun	Will uninstalling nautilus or gnome-session (which seems to want to uninstall when I try deleting nautilus) hurt my computer?
