2010-04-17T02:56:00.000Z	maco	gramm	whole panel gone?
2010-04-17T02:56:00.000Z	maco	gramm	right click on desktop and add a panel, i think.. or maybe right click on the other panel and add another panel
2010-04-17T02:57:00.000Z	maco	gramm	then on the new panel right click -> add applet, and add the "window list" applet to show where stuff minimizes
