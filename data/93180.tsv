2008-04-27T05:01:00.000Z	cky	rdavis	What trouble are you having? Are you installing themes using .debs or by hand? I'm about to try doing one by hand, it'll be interesting to see if I run into issues....

2008-04-27T05:04:00.000Z	cky	rdavis	Okay. I'll have a quick scan of the docs to see if I run into any obvious issues, but I don't usually install themes that way and can't help very much. :-(
