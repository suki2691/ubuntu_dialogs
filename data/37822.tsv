2010-06-23T15:51:00.000Z	Glaucous		I recently installed Ubuntu x64 10.04. The problem is that Ubuntu only recognises two out of my four cores on my CPU. It worked perfectly in 9.10 and on Windows.

2010-06-23T15:52:00.000Z	Glaucous	Gryllida	well I just did a fresh install, so I guess it's pretty much the same?
