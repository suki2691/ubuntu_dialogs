2006-11-08T17:03:00.000Z	mike1o		hi I hope somebody can help me solve my problem, I can't use my headphones... I have no "Headphone Jack Sense" on my volume control, my soundcard is SI7012
2006-11-08T17:05:00.000Z	defrysk	mike1o	also not in the switches section ?
2006-11-08T17:06:00.000Z	mike1o	defrysk	when i check my prefs there's no headphone control either
2006-11-08T17:12:00.000Z	defrysk	mike1o	not sure how to fix it , you could check in prefs of volumecontrol if jacksense is there so you can tic it to make it functional
