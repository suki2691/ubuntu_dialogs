2010-04-12T06:27:00.000Z	Syrinx		Hi all!  Not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but whenever I run Firefox in 9.10 I get a message telling me to install Flash.  When I click next, it says "Plugin already installed."  And youtube for example will not play videos.
2010-04-12T06:27:00.000Z	Syrinx		I've uninstalled and reinstalled the flash plugin via Synaptic
2010-04-12T06:27:00.000Z	Syrinx		no dice
