2010-04-30T03:11:00.000Z	RAGE8		Hello, I was just in here with a sleep mode problem, I was told to change power management and screen saver settings, I did both, and it still shuts down whenever it feeels like it. Out of the blue, can anybody please help?

2010-04-30T03:12:00.000Z	RAGE8		And it will not come out of sleep mode, when  it goes into sleep mode.
