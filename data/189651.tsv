2006-11-02T11:50:00.000Z	moshe		I'm running Edgy, and after enabling the nvidia proprietary driver, the fonts in Firefox went weird, like the menu bar and dialog fonts being much larger than before.  Anyone know how to fix this?
2006-11-02T11:51:00.000Z	Ademan	moshe	i dunno about firefox, but gdm (the login screen) for me after i install the NVIDIA drivers has bigger fonts
2006-11-02T11:52:00.000Z	moshe	Ademan	it's strange that you said that, because all my other fonts were reset to smaller sizes.
