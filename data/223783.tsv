2009-07-01T06:35:00.000Z	hellonickname		Hello. I am currently dual booting ubuntu (latest version+patched) and windows xp professional (all latest security patches, firewall etc...) If my windows install gets compromised will that mean that my ubuntu install is also compromised?
2009-07-01T06:36:00.000Z	th0r	hellonickname	no...the linux partition should be safe enough
2009-07-01T06:37:00.000Z	th0r	hellonickname	if your ubuntu install resides on an ntfs partition it won't be safe
2009-07-01T06:38:00.000Z	th0r	hellonickname	part of the protection in linux is that windows can't write to the ext partition.
