2012-09-19T17:39:00.000Z	sgo11	twitchie	thanks for the reply. just saw your post. that means regardless the change I did to liveusb with persistent storage, when installing to harddisk, the liveusb will always use the original iso. is this right? what if I uninstall some packages from liveusb. maybe they are read-only? I haven't tried yet.
