2008-08-18T10:54:00.000Z	wirenik	bobyada	In what way?
2008-08-18T10:55:00.000Z	bobyada	wirenik	Well, I change it in prefs and nothing happens. I click on my name next to my text input and it closes xchat and it's still the same.
2008-08-18T10:56:00.000Z	wirenik	bobyada	try going into edit -> preferences and changing it there
