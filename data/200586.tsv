2006-09-04T08:44:00.000Z	Eroick		Ubuntu crashes randomly. It doesn't matter what Im doing , but every so often it just locks up. Logs show nothing, the mouse wont move, I cant CTRL-ALT-BKSPC or CTRL-ALT-DEL or CTRL-ALT-F*. Its truely locked up. Any idea why? Im thinking that ndiswrapper is causing problems.
