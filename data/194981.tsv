2010-07-07T23:05:00.000Z	Michio		hello, i just burned ubuntu to a CD, but when i boot from it, there's no option to run it live
2010-07-07T23:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	Michio	you most likely burned the file to the cd as a file not as an ISO image
2010-07-07T23:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	Michio	did you download and burn the "Alternate" cd?
2010-07-07T23:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	Michio	look at the original file.. if it has "alternate" in the name then there is no "live" to boot to.
