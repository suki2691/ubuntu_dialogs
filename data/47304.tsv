2009-09-23T10:39:00.000Z	MrFSL	Xgates	read on for a better understanding of the term amd64 and its differences from ia-64 and hence its canonical name and conventional use in packages built for said architecture
2009-09-23T10:44:00.000Z	MrFSL	Xgates	I fail to see the point. Intel refers to these chips as amd64 architecture ... so why would ubuntu refer to them otherwise
