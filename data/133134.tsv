2007-05-29T06:31:00.000Z	openmindDJ		has anyone upgraded the to the newest 2.6.20.16 kernel?  I have been on the forums and it seems that there are a few people that have had issues with the upgrade..

2007-05-29T06:36:00.000Z	openmindDJ	Jordan_U	thanks for the advise.  I have a few updates, the new ubuntu kernel, headers-generic, image-generic, also a low latency kernel, and restricted modules-generic.  Which order of download would be safest?
