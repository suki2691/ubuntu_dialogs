2008-06-30T23:40:00.000Z	magnetron	screenname57648	what sort of a complaint? a bug report?
2008-06-30T23:43:00.000Z	magnetron	screenname57648	did you read the "ubuntu comes with no warranty"-message? if there is any technical problem with ubuntu, please file a bug report. if you feel that any laws have been violated, contact the police. if you feel that Canonical Ltd owes you money, sue them.
