2008-01-10T21:39:00.000Z	Johan-		ok, sorry for spamming again but: I'm having som strange behavior on my newly installed 7.10 desktop, in gnome everything goes extremely slow (when gnome actually starts, half of the times it just give me a blank screen). And in xfce4 (that at least loads fast) I can't launch any gnome-programs, like gnome-terminal. Any ideas at all? I have no idea where to start looking for errors
