2008-11-01T03:21:00.000Z	zerothis	erisco	usb-creator lets you take an ubuntu iso, such as from an installer CD, and write it to a USB drive (thumb drive). so that one can install ubuntu with using a CD drive.

2008-11-01T03:26:00.000Z	zerothis	erisco	sorry, I missed that detail. uhm. I don't know. I don't suppose you could install usb-creator in your current system? hmm, probable complicated, I heard it requires changes to grub and some other apps
