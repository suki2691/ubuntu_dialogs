2010-10-16T14:53:00.000Z	fsiemons		Hi, I just tryed to install the newest version of ubuntu, but there isnt any posibility in the partition tool to create lvm with encrypted Partitions
2010-10-16T14:54:00.000Z	fsiemons		Does anybody knows where the posibility is to install on a encrypted Partition
2010-10-16T14:55:00.000Z	packshaud	fsiemons	i think you need the alternative cd to install on encrypted partitions
2010-10-16T14:56:00.000Z	fsiemons	packshaud	its not in the normal install cd? Isnt that a normal requirement?
