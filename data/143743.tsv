2007-03-07T17:39:00.000Z	amorphous_		How can I stop a runaway printer queue? the printing docs dont show up in the gnome-cups-man printer queue?!? - this is an apt-get'ed gnome-desktop-environment from an Xubuntu install, it's printing constantly - but theres nothing in any queues i can find. I'm running out of ideas...any suggestions?

2007-03-07T17:40:00.000Z	amorphous_	Gabz	it's off - but it's needed
