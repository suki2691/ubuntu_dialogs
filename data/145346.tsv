2008-05-28T02:06:00.000Z	rhsanborn		Strange thing happening. If I use a media player to play music (Rythmbox) and then go into firefox and try to listen to audio, nothing comes out without a reboot. Is it just me, or....
2008-05-28T02:07:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	rhsanborn	have you attempted to close Rythmbox before opening Firefox and trying to listen to audio?
2008-05-28T02:07:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	rhsanborn	afaik, only one app can use audio output at any given time.
2008-05-28T02:09:00.000Z	rhsanborn	The_PHP_Jedi	I can't remember if I've done it in that order. I just had rythmbox open, and, with it open tried to listen to something on myspace. It still wouldn't work even after closing the music player
