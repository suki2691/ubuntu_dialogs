2009-09-19T21:07:00.000Z	monostone		I'm setting up a LAMP environment on my development box. Should I setup a local DNS server as well, to resolve my local name based virtual hosts (e.g. site1.my-server.local, site2.my-server.local) or should I just stick in the server names in my /etc/hosts/ file and forget about BIND, djbdns, or any other DNS?

2009-09-19T21:12:00.000Z	monostone	stefg	yes that was my initial doubt, so i suppose the correct thing to do would be to take the extra time to install and configure a DNS
