2006-03-21T15:26:00.000Z	highvoltage	MistaED	crux
2006-03-21T15:27:00.000Z	MistaED	highvoltage	cheers, do you know if using crux reduces ram or anything like that when compared to a pixmapped clearlooks?
2006-03-21T15:28:00.000Z	highvoltage	MistaED	i'm sure crux is a bit lower, although there are other themes like 'simple' which are more ideal for increasing performance
