2008-04-05T09:08:00.000Z	GNUix		I have a laptop with a broadcom wireless card (requires firmware cutter) so I purchased a belkin pcmcia card (model F5D7010) which according to the docs is supported with the rt2500 driver but it isn't picking up.. what else can I do?
2008-04-05T09:09:00.000Z	jengelh	GNUix	use a broadcom driver, not a RalinkTech one?
2008-04-05T09:09:00.000Z	jengelh		but if the manual says so.. ok
2008-04-05T09:10:00.000Z	GNUix	jengelh	I would prefer not to use the firmware cutter as I have bad experinces with it, thats why I purchased the belkin (which is supposed to be supported)
