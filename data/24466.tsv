2011-03-17T05:28:00.000Z	trirnoth1	BitBasher	Did it end up using all of the space? My Outer Container is an 80GB partition, I was hoping the Inner Container would only be a few GB but can handle up to maybe 40.

2011-03-17T05:32:00.000Z	trirnoth1	BitBasher	I thought about creating a bunch of empty files to take up some of the space before creating the Hidden Container then deleting when completed, but seemed like a lot of time to do this.
