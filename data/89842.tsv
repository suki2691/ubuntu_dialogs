2008-05-26T19:25:00.000Z	AcornAcorn	ePax	my window border theme is set to human, but it's blue, i thought human was brown?
2008-05-26T19:25:00.000Z	AcornAcorn	ePax	there must be a setting maybe?
2008-05-26T19:26:00.000Z	ePax	AcornAcorn	I just told you how to change window boarder and not the whole theme.
