2011-05-02T01:48:00.000Z	pindropper		i am trying to add an option to one of my functions i wrote into ~/.bashrc. I am trying to do this by comparing the first arg by using if [[ "$1"= "-browse"]]; then do so and so. but every time i run it, bash says [["-browse"="-browse"]] command not found. what am i doing wrong?
