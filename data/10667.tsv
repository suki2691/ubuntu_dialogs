2011-08-12T13:40:00.000Z	danaka		okay. so I just installed 11.04 and it's VERY unstable, hard locks quite often when under load.  i looked in my system manager and it's reporting info on 2 cores. I only have one. how can I mend this?

2011-08-12T13:43:00.000Z	JakeR003	danaka	that's a start
2011-08-12T13:43:00.000Z	JakeR003	danaka	i ran ubuntu on two PCs. 1 quad cores i7 & the other quad core i5... zero problems
