2011-04-08T07:01:00.000Z	sark666		i had my windows ntfs share mounted in linux.  I accidentally moved my windows home dir to a sub dir, and then I moved it back.  but windows won't recognize my home dir anymore.
2011-04-08T07:01:00.000Z	sark666		in linux the files are all there.  is there a way to check the actual ntfs permissions when it's mounted in linux?
