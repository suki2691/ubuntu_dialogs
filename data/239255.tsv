2005-04-29T09:18:00.000Z	slappy11	mfinch	its usually the unix user accounts...root shoulda worked
2005-04-29T09:19:00.000Z	slappy11		what does sata have to do w/ ntfs?
2005-04-29T09:20:00.000Z	mfinch	slappy11	it didn't.  Other people reported this problem in support.  I don't think I will loose any functionality.  The most I ever do is delete the last print job if it gets stuck.  I can do that with the gnome tools.
