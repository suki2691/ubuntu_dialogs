2007-05-14T14:03:00.000Z	centrinel	rasmus_	you can find it by synaptic
2007-05-14T14:03:00.000Z	centrinel		just my suggestion. like i did before. another is using apt-cache or aptitude
2007-05-14T14:04:00.000Z	rasmus_	centrinel	thanks, but I've allready tried, but I can't seem to find it- do you you by any chance know the name of the package?
