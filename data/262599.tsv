2005-03-14T13:57:00.000Z	Deschanel		Hello.. Last night I tried the Ubuntu (warty) LIVE CD and I have some problems.. The rebooting is fine, the commands are fine, Ubuntu runs fastly and then I got the problems. The screen flashes NON-STOP and it drives me crazy... And my 2nd problem is that the resolution is set to 800x600 and I can't set it up to 1024x768. Any help??
