2012-09-01T01:13:00.000Z	vmachine1		any firewall experts here? i have a generic question regarding firewall setup not vendor specific but concept.
2012-09-01T01:14:00.000Z	vmachine1		my question was regarding dmz
2012-09-01T01:16:00.000Z	vmachine1		where to put my dmz network in a dual layer setup... external and internal firewall. this link http://etherealmind.com/design-enterprise-dmz-firewall-clusters/ suggests a better option is to leave the dmz on the internal so that traffic will neeed to go through two firewalls.. just wanted an opinion on that from experts in the field as im new to "firewalling"
2012-09-01T01:18:00.000Z	guntbert	vmachine1	details about generally configuring firewalls is not exactly part of ubuntu support
