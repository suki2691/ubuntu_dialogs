2009-07-10T22:09:00.000Z	Travis-42		I was doing nothing special, when everything slowed to a crawl.  I switched to tty6 to see what was causing the problem, and then a process was killed because the system was "out of memory". but only 9% of swap is used, and I have 2GB free RAM. What might be going on?

2009-07-10T22:10:00.000Z	Travis-42	vise	that was before I got the notice
2009-07-10T22:11:00.000Z	vise	Travis-42	And it simply allocated beyond 4 gb imho
