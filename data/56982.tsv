2010-06-15T02:25:00.000Z	aethelrick	sapersi	I use Vim, Gedit and Jedit on ubuntu for editing code
2010-06-15T02:26:00.000Z	aethelrick	sapersi	I find JEdit to be best for large projects with a bunch of files open because it's got a load of handy plugins available. I like Vim from the command line for editing config files and I use Gedit for one off edits to scripts etc because it starts faster the Jedit
