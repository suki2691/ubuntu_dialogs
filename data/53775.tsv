2009-07-24T22:40:00.000Z	gnat_x		hi folks. i'm having issues getting my wireless to connect to a WPA network on a fresh jaunty install. if i turn off WPA at the router i can connect. if i turn on WPA i can't. the network manager asks for a password, i give it, it hashes properly (wpa-passphrase hashed it the same on my lappy), but the net manager just spins for a while and asks again. it might be this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/348275 so

2009-07-24T22:41:00.000Z	gnat_x	joeyeye	ok. good to know
2009-07-24T22:41:00.000Z	gnat_x	joeyeye	i generally don't go in for gui's, but this machine is for someone else.
