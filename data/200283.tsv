I'm still a Linux noob, but I'm learning!  Ubuntu is on my laptop and I use it on an ancient PII as a file server.  If TheGIMP ever gets as powerful and usable as Photoshop, I may make the switch 100% :)

2006-05-26T09:08:00.000Z	anjin_	theverant	- Well, I'm a graphic design student who can't afford a Mac ... I need to know all of the Adobe appz.  TheGIMP won't cut it in the pro graphic design field.  I like GIMP, dont get me wrong... it's amazing as an opensource program.
2006-05-26T09:12:00.000Z	theverant	anjin_	don't expect that to happen anytime soon... but hey, once apple goes to Windows and makes OS X open source that'll be fine, too, right? ;)
