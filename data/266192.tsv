2007-11-26T09:23:00.000Z	tarsin		is there an ubuntu developers channel?
2007-11-26T09:25:00.000Z	tarsin		because i have a question related to patching the kernel.. and i'd like to know if linux-source-2.6.22_2.6.22-14.46.diff.gz can be obtained as a collection of patches instead of a huge file as there seems to be conflicts with the patch i am trying to apply and the ubuntu patches
2007-11-26T09:26:00.000Z	tritium	tarsin	the patches should be below the debian directory in the source package
2007-11-26T09:27:00.000Z	tritium	tarsin	check here for more info on ubuntu kernels: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam
