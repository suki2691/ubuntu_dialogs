2011-06-22T02:12:00.000Z	Belial		Are there currently any known issues with ppa.launchpad.net? I'm seeing some 404's on an update
2011-06-22T02:12:00.000Z	Pici	Belial	PPAs aren't gauranteed to exist forever. Do you see the packages listed on the PPA page for that software?
2011-06-22T02:13:00.000Z	Belial	Pici	Aware of that, I was asking as there were multiple 404's that were fine earlier, wondering if there may be a systems issue I wasnt aware of :)
2011-06-22T02:15:00.000Z	Belial	Pici	intlkleinblue: Must be going through some work, thats one responding with the file and one missing now :) I'll give it a while and if it persists, see if its been reported. Thanks: )
