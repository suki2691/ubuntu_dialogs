2009-09-05T05:22:00.000Z	teehee		how come no matter how many times i open a port and turn off firestarter deluge always says no incomming connections
2009-09-05T05:22:00.000Z	soreau	teehee	What tells you no incoming connections
2009-09-05T05:25:00.000Z	teehee	soreau	deluge always says no incomming connections but when i test the port on a port checker it says the same thing
2009-09-05T05:25:00.000Z	soreau	teehee	I'm not familiar to deluge and not sure what you're trying to do exactly
