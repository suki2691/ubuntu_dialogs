2011-05-06T08:47:00.000Z	izinucs	Pr0zac	you using xinerama because twinview doesn't work with 3 monitors?
2011-05-06T08:49:00.000Z	izinucs	Pr0zac	you have to hand config the xorg.conf .. not sure if it works the same as twinview but you have a virtual desktop size which is the highth of the largest monitor by the width of all the resolutions added together.. then individual native monitor resolutions within that.
