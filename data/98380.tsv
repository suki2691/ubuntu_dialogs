2008-03-21T05:34:00.000Z	Cann0n	vocx	no, you can boot windows like an application, then install games on the virtual machine, THEN play games.
2008-03-21T05:35:00.000Z	vocx	Cann0n	I mean, are Virtual Machines now powerful enough to run games? Because you need access directly to 3D and sruff.
2008-03-21T05:37:00.000Z	Cann0n	vocx	I still have my laptop's driver and application dvd. so far, everything i have done with vmware has been successful. but then again, i dont play many games. only computer game i play is D2 and thats one every 6 months. but, i can watch DVD's on a virtual windows machine
