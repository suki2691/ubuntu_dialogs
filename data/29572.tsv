2010-07-01T14:54:00.000Z	vkaraman		i could put usbhid and usb_storage into some modules file, but it somehow annoys me that hald is not working :/
2010-07-01T14:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	vkaraman	nowadays is udev + udisks ( known as devicekit-disks in jaunty )
2010-07-01T14:55:00.000Z	vkaraman	erUSUL	hald is not used anymore in lucid?
2010-07-01T14:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	vkaraman	not for disks... it is slowly being replaced
