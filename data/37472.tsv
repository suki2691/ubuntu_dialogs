2010-02-11T04:49:00.000Z	tgz_		yello. I want to rip out pulseaudio, but synaptic wants to remove ubuntu-desktop, probably because it depends on it, and that scares me just a little bit.
2010-02-11T04:50:00.000Z	llutz	tgz_	ubuntu-desktop is just a meta-package, won't harm too much
2010-02-11T04:51:00.000Z	tgz_	llutz	ok. so removing pulseaudio which then says it will remove ubuntu-desktop is not going to futz my desktop environment all to whoknowswhere?
2010-02-11T04:51:00.000Z	llutz	tgz_	shouldn't do, just watch carefully which packages are going to be removed
