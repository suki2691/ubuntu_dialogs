2004-12-17T14:14:00.000Z	brion_busy		I just installed clamav on warty; when I update its virus definitions database (freshclam) it complains that the clamav version is too old (it's 0.73; JPEG 'virus' detection was added in 0.80). Is there a clean way to get a more up to date clamav package, or should I just remove the package and install it from source?
