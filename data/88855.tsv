2010-02-28T00:10:00.000Z	narcoclepsy		computer was locking up, it has had a history of doing this i think the disk is just cooked, retrying with a new had i had lying around...
2010-02-28T00:12:00.000Z	kla	narcoclepsy	my experience with ext4 was no different than with any previous file systems I've used. The HD may be already defective as you say.
2010-02-28T00:15:00.000Z	kla	narcoclepsy	ext4 was/is very stable during the time I used it, no data corruption, fast error recoveries, reasonably fast operation, no complaints.
