2009-02-26T20:16:00.000Z	Dueland	SiDi	Is it necessary if i don't use any of them to boot up the system with? There's nothing on them
2009-02-26T20:16:00.000Z	SiDi	Dueland	well you need to unmount a partition in order to change its name so you cant rename your system partition without using a LiveCD. any other partition should be ok :)
