I can't move the mouse to alt-drag rescue them, and they don't get automatically repositioned.  How do I get them back?!

2012-11-13T02:31:00.000Z	lewq	dr_willis	which "spread out view"?
2012-11-13T02:32:00.000Z	lewq	dr_willis	do you mean expo?  Because that only lets me drag them around *before* I've unplugged the monitor.
