2009-01-25T18:41:00.000Z	Greyhound-		with 6GB of memory, do I still need to create a swap partition? will it be needed?
2009-01-25T18:42:00.000Z	Greyhound-		how big, varanus ?

2009-01-25T18:43:00.000Z	stefg	Greyhound-	and for compatibility reasons i'd still use some minor swap partition (like 256 or 512 MB)
