2007-05-02T06:19:00.000Z	Raptor45		are there any decent DVD player for linux? I've been using ogle for its menu support, but overall it kinda sucks and totem doesn't seem to play nice with DVDs last I checked
2007-05-02T06:19:00.000Z	h1st0	Raptor45	totem or vlc
2007-05-02T06:19:00.000Z	Raptor45	sanityx	h1st0, never liked VLC much in windows... guess I'll give it another shot
2007-05-02T06:20:00.000Z	h1st0	Raptor45	yeah that or check out the newew versions of totem.
