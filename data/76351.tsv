2008-11-02T06:05:00.000Z	K_Dallas	LF|Irssi	you can keep it open and not to log out
2008-11-02T06:06:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	K_Dallas	my tray is already full of stuff, keeping that open 24/7 is not really desired
2008-11-02T06:06:00.000Z	K_Dallas	LF|Irssi	but frankly, you shouldnt be needing it that often ;)
