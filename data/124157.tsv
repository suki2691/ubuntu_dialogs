2007-09-03T08:20:00.000Z	Joseph_K		Hi, I have an old Dell Optiplex GX150 (Pentium 3) on which 7.04 is listing the IDE drive as /dev/sda - is that normal under Ubuntu?  I would like to use hdparm but of course I can't.

2007-09-03T08:22:00.000Z	Joseph_K	rafaelscj	OK, that was simple, thanks.  :)  Do you know why it is like that?
