2007-01-03T14:29:00.000Z	dimitri	Gruppy	is there a way for me to check that once i got to work to morrow? or am i pushing my luck here :)
2007-01-03T14:31:00.000Z	Gruppy	dimitri	 ASK THE ADMIN,   the good stuff like WIRESHARP runs passively and unless you fingerprint the network and other suspicious behavour you won't pick it up
