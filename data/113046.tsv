2007-11-23T07:15:00.000Z	Pelo	patrickkkk	ddi yo try to enable the effects in menu > sustem > prefs > appearance ?
2007-11-23T07:16:00.000Z	patrickkkk	Pelo	: yes but it says desktop effects cannot be enabled or something to that effect
2007-11-23T07:17:00.000Z	Pelo	patrickkkk	try asking in #compiz-fusion if your card is strong enough, itmight not be,  the isntaller usualy adds compiz if the hardware can handle it
