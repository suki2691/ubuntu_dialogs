2006-08-23T11:11:00.000Z	sandpaperback		Hello everyone.  Is there a way to make xchat-gnome autoexecute particular commands once connected to a server?
2006-08-23T11:12:00.000Z	sandpaperback		I swear I had it working, but then I deleted my config files. >_<

2006-08-23T11:13:00.000Z	sandpaperback	knurg	But I can't seem to find where in there I would put commands (aside from joining channels).
