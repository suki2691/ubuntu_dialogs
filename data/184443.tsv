2006-06-18T08:23:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	zhenr1	to install webmin? Dowload the .tar.gz from the site, unpack it, and run /setup.sh
2006-06-18T08:24:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	zhenr1	- you'll have to use sudo ./setup.sh
2006-06-18T08:25:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	zhenr1	the third-party modules? Nope, just copy-paste the .wbm file from the website into the module installer
