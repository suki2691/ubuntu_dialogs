2007-07-04T09:20:00.000Z	bronze		I'm using utorrent thru wine and at first everything was good but now I can't get the main window to open. The tray icon is there, and I can see that it's downloading but I can't open the window. Suggestions?

2007-07-04T09:25:00.000Z	bronze	demon_spork	then recommend me some. It HAS to have encryption, and also a "DHT disable" choice.
