2008-06-25T01:31:00.000Z	ShinjinAkage		I am having some trouble with a tutorial. The tutorial is teaching me how to write shell scripts and as an example it had me create the directory bin in my home directory which properly added like it was supposed to and I can execute from it. But the tutorial also asked me to create a .bash_profile in the bin directory and restart. I put the two alias examples in it but neither one seems to work. What's wrong?
2008-06-25T01:33:00.000Z	ShinjinAkage		Is the .bash_profile supposed to be in the bin file in my home director and how do I make it work?

2008-06-25T01:34:00.000Z	ShinjinAkage	iank	Okay, I'll fix that and see if it works. Thanks for the help
