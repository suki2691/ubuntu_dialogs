2007-07-15T13:00:00.000Z	d1gita1		I am trying to install fiesty on my laptop. I have 2 identical dell laptops, one of which i have already installed it successfully, so hardware compatibility is not an issue.  I reach the partitioning step during installation, and whether i use guided or manual partitioning, it says that it failed to resize my windows partition.  Is there a way to fix this without deleting the partition altogether?
