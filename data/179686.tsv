2010-02-12T04:10:00.000Z	jrib	wterrey	why command?  Just go to Places -> Home  and then your downloads folder.  Or: what do you actually want to do?
2010-02-12T04:12:00.000Z	jrib	wterrey	erm, why do you want an antivirus?
2010-02-12T04:14:00.000Z	jrib	wterrey	well first off, the antivirus that you run on linux are usually for finding windows viruses (for mail servers for example) and second, you aren't running windows, stop worrying about silly things
