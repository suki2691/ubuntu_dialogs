2009-03-16T08:37:00.000Z	halycon		Hi everyone I am using a program called Hamster which is a gnome panel applet and the Global Hotkey Super+H does not work although it did in the past. Does anyone know what would cause this? As far as I know there are no conflicting keyboard shortcuts
2009-03-16T08:39:00.000Z	sir_yodle1	halycon	fiddle around in System-Preferences-Keyboard-Layouts-Other Options.  I had some difficulty too; "default" binding for Super doesn't seem to work great for me.  I just started using other keys.
