2006-07-30T14:29:00.000Z	redblades		Hi, I have encountered a _very_ serious issue.
2006-07-30T14:29:00.000Z	redblades		My password was compromised, and I changed it, but I can't recall the exact password
2006-07-30T14:30:00.000Z	Gumby	redblades	boot into single user mode or use a boot cd to chroot into your root environment and then change the password
2006-07-30T14:30:00.000Z	redblades	Gumby	wont it ask for the password before I can use sngle user anyway?
