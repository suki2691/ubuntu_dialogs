2007-07-23T09:09:00.000Z	acecase		im thinking maby i should get back to gentoo
2007-07-23T09:10:00.000Z	dyrne	acecase	debian maybe. i wouldnt use gentoo :)
2007-07-23T09:12:00.000Z	acecase	dyrne	I don't know about the whole debian system. I'm sure it's great but I don't know how to do the basic crap with it. I know how to build a kernel for this box under gentoo because it just uses the basics. grub doesn't use grub.conf anymore but menu.lst is the same format
