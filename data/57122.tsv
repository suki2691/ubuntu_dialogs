2009-05-16T22:22:00.000Z	newguy88		newbie here asking for help.  I built a PIII box and put 9.04 on it.  Everything seems 100% ok, except one tiny thing.  In the resolution setting, I can't get 1360 X 768.  I have a brand new 21"   1920 X1080 monitor and I want to maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio.  Can I ask someone for some assistance or point me in the right direction?  Thanks in advance.  The video card is an ATI AIW 9000.
2009-05-16T22:22:00.000Z	mibmib	newguy88	did you already read the manual?

2009-05-16T22:24:00.000Z	newguy88	mibmib	 is there a manual?  I assumed it would just point at the place where you change the resolution.  The choice I want is not there.
