2010-12-17T05:03:00.000Z	aertyu		i simply made a copy from one machine to an other machine if i do ls -l on the first i got total 8512   and the second if i do ls -l i got  total 8360  is that normal ?
2010-12-17T05:04:00.000Z	itaylor57	aertyu	that can be normal depending on the block size of the different macines
2010-12-17T05:06:00.000Z	itaylor57	aertyu	what kind of host to what kinda of host?
2010-12-17T05:11:00.000Z	itaylor57	aertyu	I am probably the wrong person to answer this, more knowledgeable in solaris, but yes getting different resultant sizes across hosts is normal
