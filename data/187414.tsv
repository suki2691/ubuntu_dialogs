2012-02-16T02:00:00.000Z	piehands		I am an absolute Ubuntu novice, and I needed to try and retrieve some files from a dodgy hard drive & was told that I could install Ubuntu and backp the files from there... So I installed Ubuntu on my Windows 7 64bit machine, and now I cannot boot Windows anymore, it comes up with the error "error: no such device: aa47e41b-f58f-4009-a05f-9ff32db85c8c. grub rescue>" - This is as far as I can
