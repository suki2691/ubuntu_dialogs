2009-10-21T01:26:00.000Z	kyon-MTfr		Good evening, I have a silly problem with a bash script I wrote... can I get some help, please ?
2009-10-21T01:26:00.000Z	kyon-MTfr		that script is supposed to copy a file to a destination with another file name ; the displayed cp command works when I type it separately, but fails in the script
2009-10-21T01:27:00.000Z	kyon-MTfr		oh. thanks, then.
2009-10-21T01:27:00.000Z	Billiard	kyon-MTfr	you can pm me about it if you want
