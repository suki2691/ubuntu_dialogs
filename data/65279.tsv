2009-02-27T21:37:00.000Z	RPS		Hello Guys, I did a reboot and of course everything is running smooth again just like it always does for a day or two and then my sound will drop out or hang up and I'll reboot again ....uh, this was one of the reasons I stopped using MicroCrap's WinBlows ...I have had some very sharp minds try to help me fix this problem, but we had No luck and I'm frustrated. I have been told that there were some sound issues with pulseaudio when 8.10
2009-02-27T21:37:00.000Z	RPS		was released (if I'm remembering correctly.) Will these sound problems be worked out on the next release?
