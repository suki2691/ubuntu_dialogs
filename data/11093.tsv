2011-08-04T16:21:00.000Z	jolson		Hi! I recently installed Ubuntu 11.04 (no upgrade). Now Evolution and NetworkManager have lost their memory and ask me for passwords every time I start them. Immediately afterward, the Gnome keyring want's me to choose a password and enter it twice. How can this be solved?
