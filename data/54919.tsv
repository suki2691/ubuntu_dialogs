2009-06-10T01:55:00.000Z	Slart	togetic	seriously.. just repeat your question.. we don't want to scroll up to search for it
2009-06-10T01:56:00.000Z	togetic	Slart	i can't login, after typing my name, kdm just goes back to the login screen again. and when i'm in a tty screen i can't use any commands, none work, ls, cd, apt-get, etc. i think something is wrong with my PATH, help please?
2009-06-10T01:58:00.000Z	Slart	togetic	well.. if you can't run any commands you need to fix it by using a live cd.. not really sure how to do that.. sorry
