2011-02-28T22:36:00.000Z	bbd_		I have trouble upgrading from 10.04 to 10.10, I keep having trouble with the upgrader telling me that "Could not calculate the upgrade" etc. I thought it would be the ppa's but after turning all off won't work and after deleting them will keep on giving me the same error, anyone?
2011-02-28T22:37:00.000Z	jrib	bbd_	do you have xserver-xorg-video-nouveau installed?
2011-02-28T22:38:00.000Z	bbd_	jrib	no, I don't
2011-02-28T22:38:00.000Z	jrib	bbd_	what non-official repositories did you have enabled?
