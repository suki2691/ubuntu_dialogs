2005-05-08T10:36:00.000Z	teced		Guess we have too many questions here, but all I want to know is how can I get Real Player 10 installed on ubuntu 5.04?!
2005-05-08T10:37:00.000Z	teced		But the BBC uses Real Player so I have no option...
2005-05-08T10:38:00.000Z	teced		Yes, it does but I'm having to boot up Windows just so I can receive BBC video news!!
2005-05-08T10:39:00.000Z	karl	teced	you couldn't get realplayer 10 from the restrictd formats wiki?
