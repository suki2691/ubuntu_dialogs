2007-07-10T11:04:00.000Z	switchcat		hmmm okay I have an Audigy 2 ZS which seems to have been recognized by the system.  this is a new 7.04 install, I'm currently running a video but getting no sound and have only just hooked up the speakers for the first time.  Does anybody have any suggestions for testing the system or otherwise diagnosing it?  I am hearing nothing.

2007-07-10T11:05:00.000Z	Slart	switchcat	then checking the cables.. checking all the volume-thingies
2007-07-10T11:09:00.000Z	Slart	switchcat	I would try with vlc player first.. it seems to be the easiest to get going.. if that works you can go hammer on the other players to see why they don't work
