2012-05-26T21:58:00.000Z	EliahKagan	wobble	if you download from that site it will automatically pick a good mirror, that is better than any direct link we can give you, is that not working for you?
2012-05-26T22:00:00.000Z	EliahKagan	wobble	if you need a direct link you can use http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso (32-bit) or http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso (64-bit) but that may not be as fast as an autoselected mirror (go to http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop, pick 32-bit or 64-bit, and click Start download)
