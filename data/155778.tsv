2006-12-05T10:33:00.000Z	matiseijas		hello, can somebody help me? I'm trying to upgrade from 5.10 and everytime I run the command 'gksu "update-manager -c" ' and I enter my password it tells me I've typed a wrong password. I've retried this method a billion times and I still get the same error. What can I do to fix it??
2006-12-05T10:34:00.000Z	matiseijas		should i do that? cuz the wiki states that "Please note - this method is much less reliable. If you use this method, you MUST be prepared to fix problems manually, such as packages being unexpectedly removed, apt crashing unexpectantly, etc. Using Update Manager (see above) is likely to be much less problematic."
