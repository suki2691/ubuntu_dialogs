2010-04-01T06:26:00.000Z	codygman		i mean like sendmail
2010-04-01T06:27:00.000Z	chelz	codygman	you have to have an outgoing mailserver of somekind. ISPs provide them and also places like gmail allow it
2010-04-01T06:29:00.000Z	chelz	codygman	yes but some ISPs don't like their customers sending out traffic on the outgoing mail port since it's used for spam a lot
