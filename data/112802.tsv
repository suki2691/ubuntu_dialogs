2008-01-20T04:49:00.000Z	Bax		hey if I am using a program in ubuntu (fiesty) and it freezes, what combination of keys (like control-alt-delete) will un-freeze it?
2008-01-20T04:51:00.000Z	xenthro	Bax	maybe someone has a better solution, but I usually have the gnome-system-manager widget in my gnome bar. it gives you something similar to hitting ctrl alt del
2008-01-20T04:53:00.000Z	xenthro	Bax	sorry its gnome-system-monitor, not gnome-system-manager
2008-01-20T05:00:00.000Z	xenthro	Bax	if you pull up a virtual terminal, I recommend you get "htop" an tiny app that shows all running processes and is based on the command line
