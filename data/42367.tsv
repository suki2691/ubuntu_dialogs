2010-01-24T07:19:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT		Guys, I'm trying to get my media box set up, and it's mostly working. Now these instructions indicate that I have to have my xbmc session "auth'd properly" to be able to suspend/resume with the remote.. What does that mean and how do i do it?

2010-01-24T07:19:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT		As of 9.11 alpha 2, XBMC uses ConsoleKit in the Karmic packages so you need to make sure your session gets auth’d properly or you’ll end up with permission denied messages in the xbmc logs when it tries to suspend.
