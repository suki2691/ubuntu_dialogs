2011-01-23T03:03:00.000Z	brontoeee	iDope	i'd just figure out a way to not start x/gnome, its easy to break things with heavy uninstalls
2011-01-23T03:04:00.000Z	iDope	brontoeee	I've already done that much. And I am pretty sure I wont break anything (or wont care even if I break a GUI component) which is critical to what my system is doing right now (acting as a transparent proxy and my home gateway)
