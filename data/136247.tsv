2009-04-30T09:00:00.000Z	Gnea	tony423	because it's open source
2009-04-30T09:01:00.000Z	Gnea	tony423	it's a totally different business model
2009-04-30T09:02:00.000Z	Gnea	tony423	it's like trying to charge for a unix OS that doesn't updated for years, then trying to sue the pants off of open source users - makes no sense :)
