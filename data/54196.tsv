2010-04-02T16:49:00.000Z	gregg		really complicated question here: I have a desktop computer I use as a media server - holds all my mp3's and whatnot - I do all my "work" on my laptop, access files from the server via samba. Problem is, if i want to move a file on the server from dirA to dirB it goes through the laptop, meaning it takes FOREVER - any other ways to connect to my server where i could manipulate files directly?
