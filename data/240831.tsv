2005-04-30T16:01:00.000Z	pagefault		does anyone have any idea why my clock slowly drifts ahead on me?
2005-04-30T16:01:00.000Z	pagefault		like 20 minutes a day
2005-04-30T16:03:00.000Z	darkaudit	pagefault	haven't found an answer yet... other than changing the clock sync to periodic, rather than once
2005-04-30T16:03:00.000Z	pagefault	darkaudit	yeah it's rather annoying
