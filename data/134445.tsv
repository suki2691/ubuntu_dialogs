2007-05-22T07:53:00.000Z	Slart	ionstorm	from what I've read, all the encryption software that does encryption of volumes will empty then volume when they encrypt it.. ie no encrypting in place
2007-05-22T07:53:00.000Z	ionstorm	Slart	ok
2007-05-22T07:53:00.000Z	Slart	ionstorm	but go check out truecrypt.. they might have come up with something clever
