2009-04-21T22:57:00.000Z	ale_		ok let mi reformulate my question.. I'd like to have a program that I can use to create files so that when I open them with microfost word I don't see weird stuff (the layout should not be changed).. Now I tried with openoffice, and obviously I couldn't safetely save in microfost format.. So I thought I could do it with RTF files, which (I believe) work also with MS sofware.. Any idea?

2009-04-21T22:59:00.000Z	ale_	pepperjack	so what do you suggest me? Should I stick on ooffice and save in rtf format?
