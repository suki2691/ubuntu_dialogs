2005-10-10T07:59:00.000Z	sr99		my ubuntu starts with an error. the theme "Human" cannot be loaded
2005-10-10T08:00:00.000Z	sr99		gnome does not start it only reacts on a restart command. I'll try from console. where can I download the deb package for ubuntu-art?
2005-10-10T08:01:00.000Z	avalost	sr99	apt-get install ubuntu-art
