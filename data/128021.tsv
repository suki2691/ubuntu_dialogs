I tried to install Xubuntu, however on every download I did ( Torrent and direct download) the cd would be defective. However, I was able to download / burn / install Kubuntu to my old Gateway E3000 with 128mb of Ram. It is kind of slow and was wondering what size I should get. I was thinking of just purchasing a 256mb or 512mb ram stick, though I am just trying to get the minimal spec as this is only goi

2007-07-14T14:52:00.000Z	hypertyper	reed026	if the board supports a total of 256mb, then it won't recognize anything larger than 128 per slot, assuming 2 slots.
