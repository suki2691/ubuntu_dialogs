2009-11-27T10:23:00.000Z	jackeveryman	Flannel	Well that specific tasksel isn't working for me, so I'm going to leave it be
2009-11-27T10:24:00.000Z	Flannel	jackeveryman	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  will walk you through the process (there's only about half a dozen packages)
2009-11-27T10:25:00.000Z	jackeveryman	Flannel	Oh I know, I have a little file with all the how-tos from previous installs. There's stuff like the subversion nautilus utility and phpmyadmin etc. etc. that are all set up and ready to go with this though. Ah well, when I get the chance to do a clean install it'll probably work
