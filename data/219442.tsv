2009-12-13T14:50:00.000Z	hiouh		Hey I did a backup of all my installed programs, so I have like 100+ .deb files.. How do  I install them all at once rather then clicking one by one??
2009-12-13T14:51:00.000Z	Flannel	hiouh	use dpkg, and globbing (dpkg -i *)
2009-12-13T14:51:00.000Z	Flannel	hiouh	Just be careful, those deb files might be the same programs with multiple versions
2009-12-13T14:54:00.000Z	Flannel	hiouh	notthe ones given to you
