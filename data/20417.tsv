2011-01-13T17:26:00.000Z	PsycKho		Hi. I got a question if someoone may help
2011-01-13T17:27:00.000Z	PsycKho		When I type per exemple gedit sumthin, it opens a gedit window, but the terminal hang until i'm done with it. How to "seperate" them?
2011-01-13T17:28:00.000Z	datacrusher	PsycKho	if you called any program from terminal, it will be locked until you close this gui box
2011-01-13T17:28:00.000Z	PsycKho	datacrusher	: That's the matter. Is there anyway to call it from the terminal without locking it?
