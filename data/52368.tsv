2011-06-01T06:26:00.000Z	arleslie	zeroXmalice	is it running with sudo/as root?
2011-06-01T07:01:00.000Z	arleslie	zeroXmalice	you must use twinview and the monitors but be the same resolution.
2011-06-01T07:01:00.000Z	arleslie	zeroXmalice	I have no issues with that setup on a dual-monitor setup... I just have issues when I throw my third monitor in there
