2009-03-07T14:42:00.000Z	daftykins	paulSterio	/etc/hosts for Linux
2009-03-07T14:45:00.000Z	paulSterio	daftykins	how do I write to the hosts file? it's read only
2009-03-07T14:46:00.000Z	daftykins	paulSterio	"sudo nano /etc/hosts" in terminal for command line, or "sudo gedit /etc/hosts" for a GUI editor
