2006-05-20T06:46:00.000Z	Ng	jeffro	I would recommend re-installing the ubuntu version, then if you really want to upgrade it to the latest version, follow the guide at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion
2006-05-20T06:47:00.000Z	Ng	jeffro	you can reinstall the ubuntu one with "sudo apt-get install --reinstall firefox" or use synaptic
