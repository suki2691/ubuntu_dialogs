2008-04-13T18:44:00.000Z	sivel27		i know that,and i uninstalled it, as it did nothing
2008-04-13T18:45:00.000Z	Starnestommy	sivel27	envy probably caused more problems
2008-04-13T18:47:00.000Z	Starnestommy	sivel27	envy is unsupported and I've heard of users needing to reinstall to fix problems caused by it
