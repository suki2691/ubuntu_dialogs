2008-10-04T16:24:00.000Z	gregge		I've got a fresh copy of xp, and a fresh copy of ubuntu, yet everything is faster in XP... bloody annoying
2008-10-04T16:24:00.000Z	ziroday	gregge	have you installed all the drivers?
2008-10-04T16:26:00.000Z	gregge	ziroday	yep. the video drivers are there, don't know which others I need to improve speed. Above all watching flash-videos is really slow
2008-10-04T16:26:00.000Z	ziroday	gregge	that is a flash issue, try using flash 10 or a free software alternative
