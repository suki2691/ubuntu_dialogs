2007-11-26T02:52:00.000Z	ciacon		hi all - I have a Q - what is the best way to find out what kind of Sound System I use?? I just installed the Kubuntu 7.10 and am experienceing some sound problems - all command line apps seem to have problems accessing the soundcard and I also have the feeling, that Kopete does not notify me of new messages thaks to sound-problems - can someone give me some advice??

2007-11-26T02:54:00.000Z	ciacon	Rudd-O	how can it happen, that the simplest of programs (for eg mpg123) can't access the sound-card?? is this due to a malconfiguration?
