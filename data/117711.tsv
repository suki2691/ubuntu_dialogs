2007-10-06T14:36:00.000Z	oliver_g_	milardovich	where did you get the .cda files?
2007-10-06T14:38:00.000Z	oliver_g_	milardovich	if the .cda files are from copying a cd under windows, you can't convert them to mp3 i think
2007-10-06T14:41:00.000Z	oliver_g_	milardovich	oh ok then :-) i confused the .cda files then
