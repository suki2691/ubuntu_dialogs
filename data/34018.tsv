2010-06-07T19:26:00.000Z	P-Nuts		Hello!  What's the easiest way to mount an ext4fs disk on Ubuntu 8.10?  Is there a kernel module I can install to add support?
2010-06-07T19:27:00.000Z	BPower	P-Nuts	did you try searching apt for "ext4fs"?

2010-06-07T19:29:00.000Z	BPower	P-Nuts	k. I don't know much along those lines either, just thought I'd ask 'cause that would be my first step.
