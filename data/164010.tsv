2007-10-08T10:48:00.000Z	kotau		Hello channel.  How do I eject my 4 partitions on a USB external drive?  I use the rightclick menu and eject them all at once, but they immediately pop back up, and will not give me even a few seconds to eject them.  Is there a way to eject and halt the drive?

2007-10-08T10:51:00.000Z	kotau		quick vmware question.  Can I use an existing install of xp (on another partition) and run vmware with that?
