2008-03-24T01:45:00.000Z	Ketzerei		Ubuntu won't install. I get this error: "The installer encountered an error copying files to the hard disk:
2008-03-24T01:45:00.000Z	Ketzerei		[Errno 5] Input/output error
2008-03-24T01:45:00.000Z	Ketzerei		This particular error is often due to a faulty CD/DVD disk or drive, or a faulty hard disk. It may help to clean the CD/DVD, to burn the CD/DVD at a lower speed, to clean the CD/DVD drive lens (cleaning kits are often available from electronics suppliers), to check whether the hard disk is old and in need of replacement, or to move the system to a cooler environment."
