2010-08-13T16:19:00.000Z	zodihax		i got this wierd problem.. im about to install some drivers, so i unpack them with tar -xvzf and then try to execute configure with "./configure".. which says it cant be done - what's wrong? im certain it has something to do with permissions - i just cant sort it out
2010-08-13T16:19:00.000Z	zodihax		it says: "sh: Can't open ./configure"
2010-08-13T16:20:00.000Z	littlepenguin	zodihax	is there a configure script in this folder?
