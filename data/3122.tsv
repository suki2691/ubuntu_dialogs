2012-06-02T04:26:00.000Z	HelloWorld321		After trying to upgrade to Precise Pangolin, now when I boot, I get this message "The system is rnning in low-graphics mode.  Your screen, graphics card, and input device settings could not be detected correctly.  You will need to configure these yourself"  I can ssh in just fine, but I have trouble seeing/using the desktop.
