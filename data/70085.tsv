2009-01-03T02:56:00.000Z	ehmck		someone please help me-- i've totally screwed up my Hardy-- i was trying to upgrade my vim with this: http://packages.debian.org/sid/vim, but I didn't realize I pulled in a lot of other stuff that has broken/removed a lot of my core apps (pidgin for one)
2009-01-03T02:57:00.000Z	ehmck		is there any way to fix this?
2009-01-03T02:57:00.000Z	AlexKibler	ehmck	Try reinstalling the things you removed.
2009-01-03T02:57:00.000Z	ehmck	AlexKibler	I've tried, but it says I have the wrong version for dependencies (specifically perl-base)
