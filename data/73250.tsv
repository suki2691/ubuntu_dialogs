2008-12-12T22:00:00.000Z	dinsdale07	jeeez	have you tried adding the workspace switcher. Usually you set the numbers of ws there.
2008-12-12T22:01:00.000Z	dinsdale07	jeeez	once added or maybe it's already there, right click it and select preferences.
2008-12-12T22:06:00.000Z	dinsdale07	jeeez	unforutnately not to my knowledge. And I think compiz is not the right tool to change the amount of desktops, that's gome
