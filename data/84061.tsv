2008-07-31T17:25:00.000Z	fde	Bigmack83	umm... it's the same thing
2008-07-31T17:25:00.000Z	Bigmack83	fde	Yea i know lamp is all those, i just didnt know if there would be any performance difference
2008-07-31T17:26:00.000Z	fde	Bigmack83	you can't install 'lamp' (well, you probably can... but it'll be a meta package)
