2012-05-13T02:09:00.000Z	bluefox83	shazzr	is it taking a long time?
2012-05-13T02:19:00.000Z	shazzr	bluefox83	It does not work. I try to install 12.04, but it fails when installing GRUB. It does not seem able to find a place to put it. I have a RevoDrive which does not exactly show up as /dev/sda or /dev/sdb....more like /dev/disk/by-id/xxx-xx_xx_1234567890 And since I don't know _that_ much about what goes on behind everything, I'm sort of stuck.
