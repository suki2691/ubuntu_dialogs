2005-10-01T07:14:00.000Z	Kimahri	bob2	it's always required a working .config in the kernel source folder for me
2005-10-01T07:15:00.000Z	bob2	Kimahri	yes, and the source packages contain no .config files in the tree; nor the built headers
2005-10-01T07:16:00.000Z	Kimahri	bob2	that's why you .config and build it yourself :)
