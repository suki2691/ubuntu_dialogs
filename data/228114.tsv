2011-02-10T09:30:00.000Z	jack_	Clavin12	i believe virtualbox can but its dangerous? i read that somewhere
2011-02-10T09:31:00.000Z	jack_	Clavin12	if you present the partition as a disk to vmware it might work. i've never actually used vmware though :)
2011-02-10T10:06:00.000Z	jack_	Clavin12	i dont think so. mine doesn't
