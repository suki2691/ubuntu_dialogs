2009-01-12T06:28:00.000Z	earthmeLon		Hello!! I need to figure out a way to run SAMBA on user logon instead of at startup.. I only want samba to run if a specific user logs in.
2009-01-12T06:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	earthmeLon	 samba is a service.. that makes little sence
2009-01-12T06:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	earthmeLon	 the samba-doc pakcage has all the info you would ever want on samba - if its doable - it may be mentioned in there.
2009-01-12T06:30:00.000Z	earthmeLon	dr_willis	 It makes perfect sense to me.  I only want to run the service if my main user logs in.  Not if a guest user logs in.  It has nothing to do with samba, it has to do with Linux/Ubuntu.  The samba docs will provide little/no help in what I'm trying to do
