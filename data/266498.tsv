2010-04-03T20:06:00.000Z	roadapathy		ARRGHHH. Anybody with ATI HD3200 trying to recompile the kernel???
2010-04-03T20:07:00.000Z	roadapathy		Actually, all I really want right now is a boot MENU...I want to be able to SELECT my stupid Kernels when I boot. Why does it force just the 1 kernel?
2010-04-03T20:08:00.000Z	roadapathy		SPEAKING OF GRUB/GRUB2. How can I get the menu back? I like the old style menu where it lets me choose from a list of Kernels! :-(
2010-04-03T20:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	roadapathy	 just set it not autohide the menu in the /etc/default/grub file
