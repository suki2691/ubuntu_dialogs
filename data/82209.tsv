But then I think probably there is some file system that works on this way on os level. Does anybody know the name?

2012-11-20T03:28:00.000Z	X-warrior	ActionParsnip	I think it could preserve my hard links, but if I don't have it yet. How is it possible? I didn't find this option on it
2012-11-20T03:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	X-warrior	not sure there, is it listed in the man page?
