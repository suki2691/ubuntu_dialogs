2011-09-24T08:50:00.000Z	loganhoup		I'm currently have problems attempting to get a proprietary driver running for my computer with an nvidia geforce 6150se graphics card. Can anyone help me? Unity works but I keep having random crashs where I get random video noise across my screen at an angle :/ With default drivers and Unity off it still crashes too...

2011-09-24T08:57:00.000Z	urist_	loganhoup	I've heard of some driver issues with people using 11.04... I get the impression they released a few too many new visual changes and it might not have been as polished as we'd like
