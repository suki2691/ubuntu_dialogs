2010-01-13T16:44:00.000Z	LucidPerry		 What's the default location of .bashrc (I want to add aliases)?
2010-01-13T16:46:00.000Z	theadmin	LucidPerry	One should create it.
2010-01-13T16:47:00.000Z	theadmin	LucidPerry	I think you can do so in your home directory if you don't need aliases to be system-wide
2010-01-13T16:47:00.000Z	LucidPerry	theadmin	But it already exists in /etc/
