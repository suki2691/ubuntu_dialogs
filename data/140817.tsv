2007-11-18T07:05:00.000Z	Jangari		it's a rather good indictment of linux that i haven't had a process freeze so far
2007-11-18T07:05:00.000Z	ajmorris_	Jangari	in a terminal, type sudo pkill <process>
2007-11-18T07:17:00.000Z	ajmorris_	Jangari	not as buggy as it used to be, i got it when it first came compiz fusion of git ;) hardly worked back then :P
