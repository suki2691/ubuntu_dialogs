2008-11-07T02:43:00.000Z	Debolaz		I'm trying to play a DVD in ubuntu using VLC, but it keeps failing on me with problems similar to this: http://lists.medibuntu.org/pipermail/bugs/2007-April/000181.html
2008-11-07T02:43:00.000Z	Debolaz		Mplayer didn't fare any better.
2008-11-07T02:44:00.000Z	Debolaz		Is there some magical trick to getting DVD playback working in Ubuntu?
2008-11-07T02:45:00.000Z	philippe_	Debolaz	don't know about VLC. For getting DVD to work, I install totem-xime and then I uninstall totem-gstreamer. That's all :)
