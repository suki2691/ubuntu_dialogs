2009-08-13T01:14:00.000Z	mikael		Okay sorry guys. Locked my box, unlocked and now i'm getting init Unable to execute errors, the big one being that "/bin/sh" is not a directory
2009-08-13T01:14:00.000Z	jedc	mikael	/bin/sh is an executable file
2009-08-13T01:15:00.000Z	mikael	goldins	-> really??? brand new drive....
2009-08-13T01:15:00.000Z	jedc	mikael	maybe not the drive, but the system might be borked
