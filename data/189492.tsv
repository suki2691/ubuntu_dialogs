2010-04-27T05:50:00.000Z	robbyrob_		hello friends of ubuntu, i recently built a 3000 dolla setup and it seems to have quite a few kinks
2010-04-27T05:50:00.000Z	robbyrob_		it seems to not want to multitask
2010-04-27T05:51:00.000Z	robbyrob_		more specifically i can't rip a movie and have working audio playback at the same time
2010-04-27T05:51:00.000Z	coz_	robbyrob_	 mm  sounds like a hardware/software issue   have you checked in ##Linux  to see if they can remedy any of this?
