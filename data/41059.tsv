2009-12-26T19:15:00.000Z	lmaowaffle		hello guys. I was wondering if I can install ubuntu without a desktop manager (gnome, kde, xfce or other) as I'd like to avoid all the dependencies. Is this allowed via ubuntu installer? also, will those non-installed packages ever be selected during future upgrades for whatever reason? If so, can I mask them?
2009-12-26T19:16:00.000Z	jmcs	lmaowaffle	you can install ubuntu server
2009-12-26T19:16:00.000Z	lmaowaffle	jmcs	is that similar to base install of debian (standard packages without X or dev tools/libs)?
2009-12-26T19:19:00.000Z	jmcs	lmaowaffle	I don't know which libs it includes by default but it comes without X
