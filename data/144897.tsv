2007-02-25T12:59:00.000Z	mhhz	House	try 'dmesg' to see if it shows up during boot
2007-02-25T13:00:00.000Z	mhhz	House	does dmesg indicate that it was recognized?  also - you could see if the module is loaded with 'lsmod'
2007-02-25T13:03:00.000Z	mhhz	House	well... if X is running - your card must be recognized!!
