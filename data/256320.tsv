2008-10-14T02:17:00.000Z	Jorophose		if I set up ubuntu with Multi-Seat X or make it so that there can be somebody using it remotely, can I still play games if I'm connected directly to the computer?
2008-10-14T02:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	Jorophose	 should be able to if they are remote.. they will be taking up some of the ram/processor load.. but ive done so befor.
2008-10-14T02:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	Jorophose	 not sure about Multi-seat X however..
2008-10-14T02:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	Jorophose	 i tend to just use xdmcp, or vnc
