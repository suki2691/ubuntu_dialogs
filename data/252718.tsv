2008-01-16T16:43:00.000Z	harveyd		so would anyone have an idea why my windows drive (hda1) has suddenly dissapeared from ubuntu?
2008-01-16T16:44:00.000Z	juan	harveyd	is the device still there /dev/hda ? /dev/had1
2008-01-16T17:01:00.000Z	juan	harveyd	check if its listed in /etc/fstab
2008-01-16T17:09:00.000Z	juan	harveyd	perhaps an update messed up fstab, the best way to fix is to just add the details of your drive to /etc/fstab see !mount
