2012-05-23T21:22:00.000Z	chaotix		iately restarted into Ubuntu, and here I am.  My two questions are:  1.)  Can my Ubuntu partition be hacked/cracked/corrupted by this? and 2.)  I read a few times that clam av was a good tool to use to clean up my windows partition from ubuntu, would you recommend this, or an alternative action from within ubuntu? or should i just handle this prob from windows?
