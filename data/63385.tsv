2010-01-20T00:14:00.000Z	acicula	Chimpout	did you look on the winehq site if its supported via wine?
2010-01-20T00:15:00.000Z	acicula	Chimpout	its possible its simply not working, doubt the function keys for that would change, but maybe there is some specific info to find on ubuntu on mac hardware?
