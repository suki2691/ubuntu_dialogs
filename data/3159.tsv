2012-05-14T06:31:00.000Z	veebull		I'm wanting to set up a virtual LAN using Virtual Box running on my Ubuntu desktop... I want one guest vm to act as a 'gateway' with one network adapter connected via NAT, and the other connected statically to an internal network.  Should work... but all the networking guides I seem to be coming across talk about making eth0 (outward facing) use a static IP
