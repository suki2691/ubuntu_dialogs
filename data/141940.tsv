2009-08-21T00:28:00.000Z	hellhound		I am using gyachi 1.2.2 on Ubuntu 9.04 and for some reason it will set my status to "Auto Away" after the time set regardless of me still on the computer (web browsing, working on a document, etc.) and it will not let me change the status unless I chat with someone or log off and log on

2009-08-21T00:29:00.000Z	hellhound	gwildor	do you know of a way to have it read the computer's idle time?  There is only one idle setting on gyachi
