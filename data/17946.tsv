2011-02-19T02:06:00.000Z	JerrysKid	R-Touch	All I was asking is if I could boot the MoonOS 4 desktop environment or do I have to install it on a completely separate partition.  That was my question.  I am presently running 10.10, and did not want to muck up my Ubuntu Desktop 10.10 by experimenting with MoonOS.
