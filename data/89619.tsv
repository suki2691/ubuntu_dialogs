2009-08-02T02:23:00.000Z	FrozenInferno	bastidrazor	i know, but my machine never suspends. i have LEDs on the outside of my lid that blink depending on what action is going on. a white LED stays lit when the pc is fully powered, but it blinks when suspending. when i shut my lid, that LED stays lit. i also have a battery LED that turns off when suspending, but it stays on as well
