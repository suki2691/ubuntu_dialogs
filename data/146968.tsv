2007-03-05T11:14:00.000Z	ikonia	sdac221x_	you mayu have been banned last week
2007-03-05T11:14:00.000Z	sdac221x_	ikonia	 when banned do you get notified ?  or you can still come into irc rooms
2007-03-05T11:15:00.000Z	ikonia	sdac221x_	you can "remain" in an irc room if not kicked, and yes you get notified, I was only offering a suggestion
