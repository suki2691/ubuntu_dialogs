2008-07-29T01:55:00.000Z	MindChild		Ok, Installed Ubuntu on my wifes machine. Followed the sound troubleshooting wiki. Everything checks out. The mixer seems to work. Sound works on an alternate partition in windows. The drivers are loaded, the sound card is supported etc... you just hear nothing. How would I go about addressing this
