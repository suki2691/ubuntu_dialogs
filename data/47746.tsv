2011-11-03T13:16:00.000Z	theadmin	Mitchell_	No, you can use the Gnome3 fallback, though. Or XFCE ^_^
2011-11-03T13:18:00.000Z	Mitchell_	theadmin	do i just download the normal version for gnome 3? also, if i wanted to change it i could just install another one right?
2011-11-03T13:19:00.000Z	theadmin	Mitchell_	You can apt-get install gnome-shell to use the traditional GNOME3 interface, gnome-panel to use the old-style gnome2-like one (note that you can not add or remove applets) or xfce4 in order to use XFCE (which is VERY gnome2-like)
