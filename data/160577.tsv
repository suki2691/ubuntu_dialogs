2008-09-08T04:32:00.000Z	axeus		Hmm, I suppose I need to get a separate application to manage the settings of Compiz because I dont' see any type of configuration for that in X.
2008-09-08T04:34:00.000Z	axeus		Hmm, Isn't Wobbly Windows supposed to be enabled by default with Compiz?
2008-09-08T04:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	axeus	No
