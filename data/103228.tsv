2008-03-18T07:53:00.000Z	Daworm		Query, can someone advise a good IRC bouncer for use on ubuntu?
2008-03-18T07:53:00.000Z	Daworm		that's not TOO complex to configure
2008-03-18T07:54:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Daworm	maybe dircproxy
2008-03-18T08:00:00.000Z	Daworm	Starnestommy	Hurm, looks to be a toss up between IRSSI and Dircproxy...
