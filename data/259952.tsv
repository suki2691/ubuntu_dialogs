2004-11-08T09:12:00.000Z	fluoro	Cube-ness	Yeah, I know.  How is C++ or C# less portable on PPC than on x86?
2004-11-08T09:13:00.000Z	Cube-ness	fluoro	didnt mean to imply it was.. just saying theres that kind of portability too
2004-11-08T09:13:00.000Z	fluoro	Cube-ness	Yeah, I know.  I think using a language like Python or C# makes that sort of portability easier than using C or C++.
