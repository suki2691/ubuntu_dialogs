2009-05-12T15:18:00.000Z	skillz		Is anyone here any good with shell scripting with things such as tracert that can help/advise me on something
2009-05-12T15:19:00.000Z	skillz		i need to test loading times of my website on different servers, i was hoping that this could be automated in some sort of shell script is this possible?

2009-05-12T15:21:00.000Z	skillz	joaopinto	how would i do that with wget (where can i get it from?)
