The fix was to go itno the bios and set the HD to LBA mode and then reformat and reinstall. I have a lot of precious data on this hd and would love to install badger. does anyone know if this problem still exists?
2006-03-18T09:23:00.000Z	uscfan		does anyone recall that problem from a few months ago where you would need to set the hd to lba mode in order toget it to boot.....
2006-03-18T09:25:00.000Z	uscfan		has anyone here sucessfully dual booted breezy badger and winxp, then whiped the linux partition andthe mbr to go back to straight windows?
