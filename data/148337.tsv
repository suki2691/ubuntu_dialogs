2007-06-11T10:53:00.000Z	Beamoo		And it shows the "Nvidia accelerated graaphics driver "in use"
2007-06-11T10:54:00.000Z	Tom47	Beamoo	it simply means its closed source and ubuntu cannot provide support to problems arising from its intrnals
2007-06-11T10:54:00.000Z	Beamoo	Tom47	so in other words, my driver works?
