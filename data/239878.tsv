2008-01-11T07:59:00.000Z	Ryoma		Does anyone know where I can get 8.04 beta?
2008-01-11T07:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Ryoma	and it's definitely an alpha
2008-01-11T08:01:00.000Z	nickrud	Ryoma	yes, but it wouldn't be advisable to expect that to be rock solid, I usually would install the final after playing with betas
2008-01-11T08:01:00.000Z	nickrud	Ryoma	and when I didn't, I did eventually anyway, something was always broken a little
