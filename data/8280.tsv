2012-07-05T23:01:00.000Z	PhantomPhreak53		I am going to be configuring my ubuntu 12.04 server to handle email. What is the best configuration/program to use to incorporate virus scanning and spam scanning?
2012-07-05T23:03:00.000Z	guntbert	PhantomPhreak53	do you have experience running a mail server?
2012-07-05T23:03:00.000Z	PhantomPhreak53	guntbert	I setup one a long time ago and just never messed with it once it was configured so I am probably VERY rusty
2012-07-05T23:05:00.000Z	guntbert	PhantomPhreak53	then you should not run one that is publicly available , try at first in a closed network
