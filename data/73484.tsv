2009-12-26T07:57:00.000Z	mezquitale	goose	 i had to decipher the question, i thought he was having an issue with gaming system, what he actually wanted to know is an app in ubuntu that would allow him to interface with the device
2009-12-26T07:58:00.000Z	goose	mezquitale	the question seemed quite obvious to me of what he wanted to do. I'm not going to sit here and argue it with you, maybe because being a console gamer myself I'm more familiar with streaming video to console via ubuntu/ushare, but it was a legit question, no reason to get mad at grkblood13 for it
