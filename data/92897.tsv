2008-04-29T17:23:00.000Z	Stwange		anyway, that's not my question: are there any issues with the 8.04 upgrade from 7.10 (ie. should I just clean install?). I had a lot of trouble with upgrading 7.04 to 7.10
2008-04-29T17:24:00.000Z	bellsin	Stwange	i always back up and install fresh
2008-04-29T17:24:00.000Z	bellsin	Stwange	upgrade's seem to take longer too
