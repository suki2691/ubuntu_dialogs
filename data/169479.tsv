2006-08-27T14:16:00.000Z	jstarcher		how can I run an app from the CL and leave it running when I close the shell? I thought you just added & after but it won't work
2006-08-27T14:16:00.000Z	Renan_s2	jstarcher	type 'disown'
2006-08-27T14:16:00.000Z	jstarcher	Renan_s2	rgr that, thanks
2006-08-27T14:18:00.000Z	jstarcher	Renan_s2	huh? Didn't work unless I'm not doing it right. Do you do it like 'disown firefox' or what?
