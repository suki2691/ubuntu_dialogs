2007-01-17T10:58:00.000Z	lasindi		Hi all, I'm trying to get a script to run at start up on Ubuntu Edgy. I'm googling all over, but all I can find are articles talking about the advantages of Upstart over sysvinit, not any tutorials on how to actually use it. Could someone help me out?
2007-01-17T10:58:00.000Z	brandis	lasindi	tried adding an rc script?
2007-01-17T10:59:00.000Z	lasindi	brandis	yes, I've done that in the past, but I'd rather use Upstart as init is being deprecated from what I understand.
2007-01-17T10:59:00.000Z	brandis	lasindi	ok
