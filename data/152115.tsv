2007-04-30T15:13:00.000Z	xtknight	bianconeri	probably via metacity or GTK themes.  it may be a generic "panel" color that needs changing.
2007-04-30T15:14:00.000Z	bianconeri	xtknight	I have all the colors just the way I want them on my desktop, just the selector is off, using GTK themes would probably change everything, no?
2007-04-30T15:15:00.000Z	xtknight	bianconeri	yea it would .. i dont know how to change the workspace switcher in general
