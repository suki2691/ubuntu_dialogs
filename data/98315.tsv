2008-03-06T05:21:00.000Z	Pelo	[FT]Alex	not sure I get what you are saying
2008-03-06T05:23:00.000Z	[FT]Alex	Pelo	- me either :D his partition should still be there I think, since he hasn't touched it. but if gparted thinks his hard drive is empty, then it will overwrite his existing partition if he makes any changes
2008-03-06T05:24:00.000Z	Pelo	[FT]Alex	I didn'T read that part I just read where he said the installer failed to create the swap , don't know about the rest
