2009-10-30T04:04:00.000Z	JediMaster		Hey guys, got 9.10 installed from USB stick, working very nicely, extremely fast too =), lovely fresh install with ext4 =D
2009-10-30T04:05:00.000Z	JediMaster		and even so, the live USB stick was damn fast, especially considering it's an old stick
2009-10-30T04:06:00.000Z	JediMaster		quick question, the ubuntu site mentions ipod sync with rythmbox, but I can't seem to find any options to do it, am I right in thinking the iphone has to be jailbroken first?
2009-10-30T04:07:00.000Z	NoelJB	JediMaster	probably jailbroken and backlevel.  iPhones and iPod Touches are pretty much locked down.
