2009-01-16T17:21:00.000Z	Ximal		As of recently I've discovered that anything I delete while in nautilus after doing ; sudo nautilus > that I am not actually deleting files... Rather when I ask it to move files to trash they just disappear ... but the space that they took up still remains yet I look in trash and NOTHING is there... so I was wandering wtf I should do or if this is a known bug ?
2009-01-16T17:22:00.000Z	Ximal		where might I find that slart ?
2009-01-16T17:22:00.000Z	Ximal		cause I have 130 gigs sitting idle somewhere
2009-01-16T17:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ximal	 none that i have ever seen
