2005-07-24T13:39:00.000Z	Slipaway172		i have one quick question! out of the box does ubuntu come installed with a firewall that is rock solid? i want to take out my router b/c it is blocking me from websites or email accounts. sites like www.nextel.com, www.sprint.com www.g4tv.com and MANY others.
2005-07-24T13:39:00.000Z	Slipaway172		would you recommend firestarter
2005-07-24T13:40:00.000Z	mcphail	Slipaway172	firestarter seems quite good
