2005-01-18T12:29:00.000Z	bigbubba		question: if i wanted to add fortune to my /etc/profile i specify the path right? and if so is it path="whatever path" or do i just type /usr/games/fortune without the path statement?
2005-01-18T12:30:00.000Z	doubletwist	bigbubba	use using /usr/games/fortune will work.
2005-01-18T12:34:00.000Z	doubletwist	bigbubba	Dunno. Sorry.
