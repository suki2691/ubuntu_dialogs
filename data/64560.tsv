2009-05-27T06:23:00.000Z	bunchofgibberish		Hello I managed to remove a module using modprobe command to test some kind of instability problem. How can I get that module back? Is there a way to auto-scan or (if I knew what list there was install it like that?)

2009-05-27T06:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bunchofgibberish	can you "sudo modprobe MODULE_NAME"
2009-05-27T06:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bunchofgibberish	see above
