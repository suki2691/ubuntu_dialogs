2012-10-14T08:10:00.000Z	MonMotha	zykotick9	yes, the mini, sorry (I'm used to Debian).  And I do need to install at least eglibc from -proposed during the base system install, though yes I would rather not bring in everything.
2012-10-14T08:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	MonMotha	i hope you have reported a bug.  best of luck man.
2012-10-14T08:11:00.000Z	MonMotha	zykotick9	the bug is known and fixed in -proposed, which is why I want to install eglibc from -proposed
