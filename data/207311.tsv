2005-11-18T12:31:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	pilgrim	there is live cd ...
2005-11-18T12:32:00.000Z	pilgrim	wickedpuppy	and that's a true reflection of what ubuntu is capable of?
2005-11-18T12:32:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	pilgrim	live cd is the live image of the install cd ... of course once you install you got more options but you want right out of the box without any tweaking
