2005-10-02T06:41:00.000Z	Etkinson	bettong_BOFH	so you also compile gcc? heck, you compile the assembler too?!
2005-10-02T06:41:00.000Z	Etkinson	bettong_BOFH	?! you're sure?!
2005-10-02T06:42:00.000Z	Etkinson	bettong_BOFH	because i read a bit in the gentoo website, and they say they do have their packaging system. you compile the packages, but still, you don't start completely from scratch as i understood from their website..
