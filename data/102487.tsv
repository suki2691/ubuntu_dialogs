2010-03-17T11:08:00.000Z	rww	mlkovacs	Do you login to the desktop automatically, or do you need to give your username and password when you start up?
2010-03-17T11:10:00.000Z	rww	mlkovacs	The only way you'd be able to unlock the keyring without the password is by changing your keyring's password to be blank. This is insecure, because it means anyone with access to your computer can get information from it, but I can give you instructions if that's what you want.
