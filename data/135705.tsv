2011-10-15T00:46:00.000Z	Wamphyri	albert_	sudo
2011-10-15T00:46:00.000Z	albert_	Wamphyri	i cannot use sudo because it asks for a password and it doesnt accept the password which was previosly set by passwd
2011-10-15T00:47:00.000Z	Wamphyri	albert_	your using like this right     sudo passwd username  ?
