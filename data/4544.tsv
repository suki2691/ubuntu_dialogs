2012-03-20T10:02:00.000Z	npx		I installed a 32-bit version of Ubuntu using Wubi, can I install a 64-bit kernel? I just want to run 64-bit apps in a chroot
2012-03-20T10:03:00.000Z	CFHowlett_	npx	  64 bit requires at least 4 gigs of ram ...
2012-03-20T10:03:00.000Z	npx	CFHowlett_	no it doesn't, it just allows you to address more than 4gb of ram
2012-03-20T10:03:00.000Z	CFHowlett_	npx	ok -
