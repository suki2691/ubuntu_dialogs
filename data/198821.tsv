2006-02-25T12:55:00.000Z	liquidindian		Using the terminal, how can I remove nonempty directories without deleting each file in the directory?
2006-02-25T12:56:00.000Z	Madpilot	liquidindian	"rm -rf" - use carefully
2006-02-25T12:58:00.000Z	liquidindian	Madpilot	"rm -rf will recursively remove folders and their contents"  What does it mean by that?
2006-02-25T12:59:00.000Z	Madpilot	liquidindian	it means that it'll remove the folder you aim it at, and everything in that folder
