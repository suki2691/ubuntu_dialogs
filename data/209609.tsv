2007-04-22T07:19:00.000Z	Gigi		Hey guys!  I want to purchase the Micro computer from Sony Vaio (this one that is around 5 inches) It has a touch screen and it is a normal computer (just tiny)  It comes with Window$ XP (Now Vista I think) And I don't want windows (as I been 2 years without Microsoft in home)  Ubuntu is capable in that computer (Will the touch screen work?)
