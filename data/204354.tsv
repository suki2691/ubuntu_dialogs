2005-12-16T15:47:00.000Z	runevi		is there a 'proper way' to upgrade Ubuntu 5.10 to the latest kernel?
2005-12-16T15:48:00.000Z	Danar	runevi	synaptic should work fine
2005-12-16T15:48:00.000Z	runevi	Danar	I mean to the latest kernel from kernel-org, does ubuntu package them?
2005-12-16T15:48:00.000Z	Danar	runevi	oh. well you could add kernel.org to the sources.list
