2007-10-07T10:23:00.000Z	LiMaO		any idea on when a 64bit java plugin will be available for firefox?
2007-10-07T10:23:00.000Z	punzada	LiMaO	you really just have to use 32 bit firefox to enjoy web browsing in the 64 bit environment
2007-10-07T10:24:00.000Z	punzada		the lack of both 64 bit java and flash is retarded
2007-10-07T10:24:00.000Z	LiMaO	punzada	thinking of giving Kilz script a chance and trying 32bit firefox here... i'm afraid java applets may keep crashing on me
