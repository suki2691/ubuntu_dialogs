2012-03-21T07:32:00.000Z	forbidden404		Hi, there, my partition cannot be read/writed, I cant give the permission ): I tried to mount in a folder in media, and it works, but I only can access, I tried to change the permission using nautilus, and he said that I don't have the rights to change this, even in the file, where I mounted the hd with rw option
2012-03-21T07:32:00.000Z	forbidden404		what should I do?
2012-03-21T07:34:00.000Z	step21	forbidden404	some more info ... what file system? from which system are you trying it?
2012-03-21T07:35:00.000Z	step21	forbidden404	did it automount before?
