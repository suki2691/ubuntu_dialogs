2008-02-28T19:10:00.000Z	soussou		I have some screenlets running, but whenever I shut down my system, they don't reload at startup, how do I make sure that screenlets start running at startup?
2008-02-28T19:11:00.000Z	dgjones	soussou	when you select the screenlet, there's a tick box to run it at startup
