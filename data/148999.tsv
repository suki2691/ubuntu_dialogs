2007-01-16T09:51:00.000Z	ZeiP		I'm having slight problems upgrading my Ubuntu system.
2007-01-16T09:51:00.000Z	ZeiP		I upgraded manually (apt-get dist-upgrade), and that worked out fine. However, apt-get install edubuntu-desktop gives a bunch of errors for different programs, and therefore is unable to finish.
2007-01-16T09:52:00.000Z	ZeiP		Is there any hope or do I need to reinstall?
