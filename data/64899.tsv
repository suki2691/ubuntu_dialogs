2010-11-22T08:08:00.000Z	tester		Hi I have a question of the default partitioning by the 10.10 installer using Guided Use Entire Disk.
2010-11-22T08:08:00.000Z	tester		Mainly - is it placing our /home/NAME folder onto it's own partition?
2010-11-22T08:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tester	no
2010-11-22T08:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tester	by default /home is under /
