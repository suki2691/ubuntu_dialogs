2012-08-11T01:59:00.000Z	playman		why cant i make my ubuntu start at IP 192.168.1.3 it always starts at 192.168.1.4?
2012-08-11T02:00:00.000Z	deadmund	playman	edit /etc/network/interfaces or use the gui networkmanager
2012-08-11T02:00:00.000Z	deadmund	playman	perhaps that IP is taken by some other machine
2012-08-11T02:01:00.000Z	playman	deadmund	i've configured the interfaces file to use 192.168.1.3 but still it wants 192.168.1.4
