2007-01-04T11:10:00.000Z	dannydrifffft		im trying to install ubuntu 6.10 on my system with xp sp2 already on it (on a different partition). i put the cd in, choose to install ubuntu, it loads, i get the orange background screen (im guessing to start the installation) but nothing ever pops up to install. the background is a little choppy with black spots in some places. might this be that my hardware is not compatible?
