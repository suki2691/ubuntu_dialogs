2006-11-06T12:08:00.000Z	Skyrail	ifireball	ok I'll look into it :) its just that some of the links from the wiki aren't loading :(
2006-11-06T12:10:00.000Z	ifireball	Skyrail	here is a tip that seems to be not well documented, and not dumbed down in Ubunto: to install fonts go into "fonts:" in nautilus and drag the ttf files in there
