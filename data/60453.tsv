2009-04-16T06:09:00.000Z	mike3292		How can I test my speakers? There are a lot of devices to choose from under Volume Control and a lot more options in preferences and I want to do it the fastest way possible. I'm not sure if my sound will even work either.
2009-04-16T06:09:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mike3292	from the cmd line try : speaker-test
2009-04-16T06:11:00.000Z	mike3292	ULFfuntu	the second code you gave me output speaker-test 1.0.17, Invalid test type est.
2009-04-16T06:13:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mike3292	ok.. is alsa-base installed?
