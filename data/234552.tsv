2006-06-09T05:47:00.000Z	pabs3		I read that Ubuntu is moving from xchat to gaim and I'm wondering if there are scripts to migrate settings and more importantly irc logs to gaim format?
2006-06-09T05:47:00.000Z	dooglus	pabs3	both xchat and gaim connect to IRC, so it's up to you which client to use, nobody else
2006-06-09T05:47:00.000Z	dooglus	pabs3	personally I use irssi rather than xchat or gaim
2006-06-09T05:49:00.000Z	pabs3	dooglus	/ elkbuntu: yeah, I'd prefer to use the one preferred by ubuntu, but I want to migrate my settings/logs to it
