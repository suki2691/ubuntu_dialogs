2008-12-11T19:24:00.000Z	Halitech	recon61	it should
2008-12-11T19:26:00.000Z	recon61	Halitech	it's just as far as i recall , the networkmanager has most of it own setup files and the interfaces file should be unmodified
2008-12-11T19:28:00.000Z	Halitech	recon61	I never liked the network manager myself so never used it
