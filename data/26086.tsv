2010-10-03T10:01:00.000Z	g0st		So, I downloaded an ebook series (which are all in PDF format) but they are password protected. The file wants you to goto a site and fill out one of those dumb surveys, which I dont want to do. I downloaded and installed John the Ripper, but I dont know how to make it crack the password... anybody have any suggestions?
