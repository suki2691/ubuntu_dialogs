2006-11-26T15:13:00.000Z	tewn		i would like to install edgy however my motherboard requires a 2.6.19 kernel and i dont know how to compile my own kernel and i will will soon be getting an intel duo cpu
2006-11-26T15:15:00.000Z	tewn		can i install edgy with a 2.6.19 pre stable release kernel from apt-get ?
2006-11-26T15:16:00.000Z	tewn		no it would not recognize the network interface card.  possibly the XGA X3000 integrated video either.
