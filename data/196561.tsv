2006-03-08T09:09:00.000Z	Belboz99		okay, can someone at least give me an answer?  ANY answer?  I hate being ignored!  Is it OK to fsck a mounted partition while in recovery mode?
2006-03-08T09:09:00.000Z	Bilange_	Belboz99	if no one answers, its because no one is sure enough of its answers, your not being ignored :) but...
2006-03-08T09:10:00.000Z	Bilange_	Belboz99	im not sure of my answer myself, but fscking a partition is necessary once in awhile, reguardless where or how you do it (from recovery mode, from another livecd, or whatever)
2006-03-08T09:11:00.000Z	Bilange_	Belboz99	any ways, be sure to read the manpage to be sure you're not going to screw up the partition or its data :S
