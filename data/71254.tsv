2008-12-16T01:30:00.000Z	Ten1		I'm trying to install a driver, and it tells me that gcc and the kernel compiler are different versions, and further instructs me to type export CC=(kernelcompiler). It states that the kernel was compiled with gcc version 4.2.3 (Ubuntu 4.2.3-2ubuntu7), is that what I should give to export ?

2008-12-16T01:33:00.000Z	raylu	Ten1	do you have gcc 4.2.3 installed?
2008-12-16T01:34:00.000Z	Ten1	raylu	apparently I should be directing my inquiries elsewhere
