2011-05-07T17:33:00.000Z	n2i		Your problem seems to be same as mine... All i did after connecting my ubuntu with the internet is open synaptical package manager and reload or update the database for updates available...!! All the best! This is the way i solved my problem... Hope this works for you too...!!
