2009-07-27T20:39:00.000Z	capneb		the gnome desktop for my colleague in the office is freezing. we tried to do a restore from sbackup to a new server a few days ago. we don't see any related processes running and the machine was rebooted an hour ago. now his Gnome env has frozen again. Samba users cannot save files to the server. I cannot save data to ANY files I create as ANY user except root. ideas?
