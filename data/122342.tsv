2007-12-30T02:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	m1ke	do you have multiple HD's in the machine?
2007-12-30T02:48:00.000Z	m1ke		Yes but I'm partitioning just one for the install of windows and ubuntu
2007-12-30T02:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	m1ke	take the other HD out during install or use the link I provided above to put grub "in the right place".
