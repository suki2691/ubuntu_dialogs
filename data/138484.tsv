2008-04-14T04:26:00.000Z	Danish989		what is the difference between a primary partition and a logical partition?
2008-04-14T04:26:00.000Z	Danish989		should I choose primary or logical? location for the new partition: beginning or end? and what about mount point?
2008-04-14T04:27:00.000Z	magnetron	Danish989	it's only possible to boot from a primary partition
2008-06-24T15:59:00.000Z	magnetron	Danish989	there's gnome-terminal
