2007-02-03T15:26:00.000Z	blackduck3		When I turn on my Powerbook G4 laptop running the Ubuntu operating system, how do I automatically connect to the internet and hold the connection for as long as I am using the laptop. As it is I have to open the Wireless Assistant LAN manager and double click it to tell it to connect, and then once I am on the connection drops out if I am not using my web browser.
