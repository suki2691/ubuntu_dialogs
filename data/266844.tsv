2005-11-09T12:16:00.000Z	graabein		hello, i've got a couple questions
2005-11-09T12:17:00.000Z	graabein		how do i make several rar-files instead of one large with file-roller?
2005-11-09T12:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	graabein	 use the rar command line perhaps.
2005-11-09T12:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	graabein	 fileroller is just a front end to all the commands I think. Rar support in it is not that well done.
