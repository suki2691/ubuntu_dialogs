2007-04-19T07:54:00.000Z	Puppy_		I'm transferring 4 gigs of data from my ubuntu hd to my windows hd. Both are SATA, but the transfer is going slower than Paris Hilton doing a Suduku puzzle. I've transferred 20 Gig of data faster than this before (it was a IDE to SATA)... Any ideas?

2007-04-19T07:56:00.000Z	bettsp	Puppy_	ntfs-3g is really slow because it's in userspace
2007-04-19T07:59:00.000Z	Puppy_	bettsp	ok thanks!
