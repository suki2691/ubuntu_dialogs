2005-08-27T12:20:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		is it just my imagination, or is network-admin highly useless?
2005-08-27T12:21:00.000Z	_frank	Ex-Cyber	well network-admin is the only way I can setup my wireless connection, the KDE config tool doesn't work!
2005-08-27T12:29:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber	_frank	my main complaints with it are for dialup... it generates its own chatscript file in /tmp/ that you can't really edit, with what appears to be a braindead init string
