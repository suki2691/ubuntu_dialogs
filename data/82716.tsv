2012-04-01T23:56:00.000Z	tommyfun		well, I was wondering about deploying ubuntu in a computer lab, Teh first question is about pxe booting, what's the best practice?  using a golden image like windows and image all the machines or a kickstart automated installation?
2012-04-01T23:57:00.000Z	tommyfun		Second question is about installing software, best practice, is it installing packages on all the clients or installing them once on a master and exporting /usr and then mount /usr on /usr/lcoal on all the clients?
