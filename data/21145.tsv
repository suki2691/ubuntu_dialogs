2011-04-02T03:14:00.000Z	mkanyicy		what is that, root_ ?
2011-04-02T03:14:00.000Z	Auriga	mkanyicy	Oh yeah I forgot about that, this is actually for Arch, but as the Arch irc demands registration... I am looking for answers elsewhere... I figured I would pick up info here that would help across distros...
