2006-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	Zambba		I'm having problem with display refresh rate. I've changed it with dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg but I can't select 1600x1200 @ 85 Hz from KDE Control Center
2006-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	apokryphos	Zambba	have you selected that option in xorg.conf?
2006-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	apokryphos	Zambba	in the dpkg-reconfigure, that is.
2006-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	apokryphos	Zambba	if X accepts it, then it should be listed as an option in krandrtray (or kcontrol, that is)
