2011-06-17T04:24:00.000Z	howoriginalAU		I've just installed Ubuntu for the first time (11.04) coming from Windows......and I just thought I'd ask - does it take long to get used to the interface?

2011-06-17T04:25:00.000Z	howoriginalAU	edbian	oh I see. CLI is command line is it?
2011-06-17T04:25:00.000Z	edbian	howoriginalAU	yep
