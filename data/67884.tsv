I add the repository deb http://archive.canonical.com/ hardy partner which is given here -> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser but there are no Opera package there :S

2009-03-04T03:00:00.000Z	paulo39	quibbler	i actually want to install by repository because then that makes the updates easier and automatic
2009-03-04T03:00:00.000Z	quibbler	paulo39	OK
