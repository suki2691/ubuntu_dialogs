2009-07-12T14:28:00.000Z	toomai	Cube_	they disabled that nice combo in 9.04...you need to reenable it first
2009-07-12T14:28:00.000Z	Cube_	toomai	oh coz people did it on accident? did they remap it to something less common though?
2009-07-12T14:29:00.000Z	toomai	Cube_	well, they CLAIM people did it on accident...I can not figure out HOW you can do that by accident...but...well, no remap...they actually disabled it...if you reenable it, it is still ctrl-alt-backspace
