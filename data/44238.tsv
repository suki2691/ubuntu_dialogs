2009-10-31T19:08:00.000Z	jo_		Hey, In the company we have a firewall and NAT-server and I want to SSH into a box behind the firewall. This is not possible because the of the adress translation. But it is possible to acces the windows machines with teamvieuwer. How can I acces my linux box? I can't find a thing on goolge
2009-10-31T19:08:00.000Z	erana	jo_	try the iptables docs
2009-10-31T19:09:00.000Z	erana	jo_	for kernels 2.4 and up
2009-10-31T19:10:00.000Z	jo_	erana	I'll google iptables tx.
