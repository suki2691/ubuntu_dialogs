2008-11-13T02:55:00.000Z	Andriesss		anyone has been able to get the Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 01) working on ubuntu?
2008-11-13T02:55:00.000Z	fryguy	Andriesss	works in 8.04, not in 8.10 (intel hda in general, my experience)
2008-11-13T02:57:00.000Z	Andriesss	fryguy	hmm,  there's no solution to get it working?
