2012-05-22T17:29:00.000Z	Snowie	prateekp	i have no context, but what target are you trying to make clean?
2012-05-22T17:34:00.000Z	Snowie	prateekp	exactly. its telling you your trying to run a clean command. all commands have a target. the thing your executing the command on. apparently that target cant be cleaned, its against the rules. what are you trying to do when you get that error. i gaurantee i wont have the answer, but that's where the problem is
2012-05-22T17:36:00.000Z	Snowie	prateekp	yup, dont have the answer, but google that phrase even. Im sure one of the experts in here is watching me fumble with this and may have an answer
