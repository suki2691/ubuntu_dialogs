2006-08-05T14:05:00.000Z	fnoo		I just installed Ubuntu and it did not correctly set my resolution, since I have a widescreen LCD. Also, it is using "ati" instead of "radeon" drivers, so there isn't direct rendering. Since both deal with the xorg.conf, which should I try to fix first?
2006-08-05T14:05:00.000Z	NickGarvey	fnoo	that should fix that first part
2006-08-05T14:06:00.000Z	fnoo	NickGarvey	OK, but do I want to fix it first? I've had problems before where one fix would undo the other.
2006-08-05T14:06:00.000Z	NickGarvey	fnoo	no idea heh, my graphics card is not supported so I have never played with that kind of stuff
