Sorry I have to bother you with my craptastic odysee, but I only have 64k bandwidth and thats makes every blind shot quite time consuming: What do I need to play an .rm-file? I got mplayer, totem, vlc and all the gstreamer-plugins, tried some of the more or less hackish attempts proposed in various threads and yet I have achieved nothing.

2009-04-17T02:46:00.000Z	lostbuthappy	darkvertex	never :) thanks though.
2009-04-17T02:48:00.000Z	darkvertex	lostbuthappy	your loss :P
