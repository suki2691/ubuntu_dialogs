2007-01-12T12:38:00.000Z	tuxn8r	pip	I would retry the xp install into its partion. it will erase the boot record, but you can use a live cd to fix it

2007-01-12T12:40:00.000Z	tuxn8r	pip	if you do a new xp install, it will erase your boot record, but it will work. then you should be able to insert an ubuntu cd and fix the boot record
