2010-08-19T23:53:00.000Z	WillWork4Foo		Hi all - can I just ask, is this bug (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=621435) affecting anyone else in here?
2010-08-19T23:53:00.000Z	WillWork4Foo		or am I the lucky one?
2010-08-19T23:54:00.000Z	WillWork4Foo		I have reverted to running (and paying for!) Windows 7 on my netbook instead of Ubuntu, because it doesn't seem to be able to handle my battery at all.
