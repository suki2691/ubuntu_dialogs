2009-04-09T19:58:00.000Z	calc	stodorovic	you have to load the 32bit libraries which may already have 64bit copies loaded, same goes for eg Vista 64bit with its WOW emulator
2009-04-09T19:59:00.000Z	calc	stodorovic	well WOW isn't really an emulator just another copy of windows libraries runing for 32bit mode (i think)
2009-04-09T19:59:00.000Z	stodorovic	calc	ok true
