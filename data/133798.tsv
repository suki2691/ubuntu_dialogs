2007-05-19T08:53:00.000Z	Indicava		Hi, my Vista install on my Feisty Fawn / Vista dual boot just died, can anyone help?
2007-05-19T08:54:00.000Z	SonsOfAtreus	Indicava	rule of thumb is that always install Linux after MS
2007-05-19T08:55:00.000Z	SonsOfAtreus		the MBR is trumping grub
2007-05-19T08:56:00.000Z	Indicava	SonsOfAtreus	I did, and everything worked fine, except I got a "new hardware" detected dialog (x3) in Vista after the ubuntu install, today I clicked some "ignore" button and since then Vista is BSOD'ing on me...
