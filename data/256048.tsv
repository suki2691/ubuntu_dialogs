2011-10-15T20:21:00.000Z	StevenR		how do I make firefox accept text input? I can't type into any text boxes (address bar, google box, search pages on sites, etc)
2011-10-15T20:22:00.000Z	deebee	StevenR	very strange. is it only Firefox? Have you restarted Firefox? Have you restarted Ubuntu? Is it intermittent or all the time? Did you recently change anything that might have made it go wrong?
2011-10-15T20:23:00.000Z	StevenR	deebee	worked earlier. no longer works. I've not restarted anything yet
2011-10-15T20:24:00.000Z	StevenR	deebee	restarting firefox worked, but that's not awesome
