2007-12-26T08:21:00.000Z	RenatoSilva		Hi people, I'm building my 1st .DEB package, but I only know how to copy files to the system. To start, I want to know just how to put an icon of my application on the systenm menu. How???? Whinch kind of channel is suitable to this? Is there some #deb-packages or so?
