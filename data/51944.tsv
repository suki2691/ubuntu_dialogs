2012-04-11T08:21:00.000Z	paulus68	bitplane	is also a reason why It consultants are not allowed to take over pc's from their clients because this would result in a security breach (giving support on an application called isabel)
2012-04-11T08:21:00.000Z	bitplane	paulus68	that sounds more like a company policy than a legal issue
2012-04-11T08:25:00.000Z	paulus68	bitplane	well if you perform illegal transactions from the client pc it would be causing a serious problem not only for the bank for which I am working but also for Isabel since isabel is a program that is used by large enterprises to do their payments to their suppliers and do collections aswell
