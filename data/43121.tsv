2009-11-10T15:25:00.000Z	jjdmol		hi; this channel may be too broad.. but I'm looking for a way to specify a different subpixel rendering per monitor
2009-11-10T15:25:00.000Z	jjdmol		all the tools seem to assume i want the same setting for all monitors
2009-11-10T15:26:00.000Z	klong	jjdmol	i have no idea but some people in #compiz are pretty smart .
