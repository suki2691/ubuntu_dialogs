2009-09-06T03:32:00.000Z	munk		hey all, in a bash script I got grep to output a line like this: "PTS=0.1860, frame_time=33 ms, bitrate=9100 kbps". now I need to store the number 33 in a variable, how do I extract the number 33 from this line?
2009-09-06T03:32:00.000Z	munk		is there a handy command?
