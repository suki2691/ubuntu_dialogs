2008-02-09T18:25:00.000Z	pocketdrummer		more like Songbird
2008-02-09T18:26:00.000Z	grndslm	pocketdrummer	 haven't used songbird yet, but youtorrent.com is good for torrents, and then your favorite deluge, ktorrent, rtorrent, or whatever can take over from there...
2008-02-09T18:29:00.000Z	grndslm	pocketdrummer	 if you're looking for something that comes up with playlists to "similar artists" of the ones you tell it you like... pandora.com and last.fm provide that same type of service
