2009-03-23T05:59:00.000Z	Mr_Cheese	LogicFan	regardless, everyone has to start somewhere, doesnt matter what lvl of expertise CaptainMorgan is on... he came in here for a solution, not someone to tell him that his abilities wont allow him to
2009-03-23T06:00:00.000Z	LogicFan	Mr_Cheese	i didn't say it wouldn't allow him to, just that it might not be the best.  again, my apologies if i offended any one
2009-03-23T06:00:00.000Z	Mr_Cheese	LogicFan	yeah thats ok
