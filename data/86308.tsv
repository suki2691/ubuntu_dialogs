2008-07-05T19:24:00.000Z	unop	fLoOd`	thanks, i'm aware - but i choose this way
2008-07-05T19:24:00.000Z	fLoOd`		i thought theres no difference
2008-07-05T19:26:00.000Z	unop	fLoOd`	afaik, a purge and install is not the same as a reinstall - some configuration files are unaffected in a reinstall (in aptitude atleast)
