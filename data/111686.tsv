2011-10-16T23:42:00.000Z	FerchoLP		I'm going to repeat my question and then paste what I think is the answer (from askubuntu.com)
2011-10-16T23:42:00.000Z	FerchoLP		I'm running Ubuntu 64 oneiric. I have every binary package replicated in Synaptic (packageName and packageName:i386). Could this be because i have "deb http://ar.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric universe" instead of something like "deb http://ar.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/amd64/ oneiric universe" ?
2011-10-16T23:42:00.000Z	FerchoLP		oneiric now has support for multi-architecture packages. So, even though you are using a 64-bit system, you can now install 32-bit packages on it. Earlier, this was not possible. Currently, this support is also available in Debian Wheezy, which will be released sometime in 2012-2013.
