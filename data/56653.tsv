2009-05-23T09:56:00.000Z	Nirrad		Hello, using Jaunty, 64. Can not get NVIDIA settings to remain after reboot. I did the "sudo nvidia-settings" applied, and saved . But when I reboot it is back to the default setting? any ideas? Thank you in advance.

2009-05-23T10:00:00.000Z	chichihchen	Nirrad	make a copy just in case.  then overwrite xorg.conf without merging settings..
