2012-02-20T16:17:00.000Z	diiiisk		Hello - I am installing 11.10, and I have a laptop with 14gb and 250gb partitions, when I click "install with windows" it'll let me slider only the 14gb, giving me about 4gb to use. When I click "do something else" it won't visually show me the disks - this used to be better in 8.04 I think. I see /dev/sdb, then under that sdb1, 9gb/8gb used, 3.8gb free (this is what it allows me to use) then sdb2 104mb, and then sdb3 240gb, unknown.
2012-02-20T16:18:00.000Z	diiiisk		I want "look at all the free space everywhere and let me use about half of it for ubuntu without screwing it up" option :p
2012-02-20T16:18:00.000Z	diiiisk		I can mount all of sdb3 to /, but not scale it
2012-02-20T16:18:00.000Z	RobinJ1995	diiiisk	report it as a bug ;p
