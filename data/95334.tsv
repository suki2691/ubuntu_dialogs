2008-04-26T07:03:00.000Z	TheFearsomeFufu		I'm trying to upgrade to Hardy. However, when ever I try to, the upgrade tool thing says I don't have enough disk space. How can I clear more space? I emptied my trash, and there's hardly anything on my desktop or home folder or anything. I dunno why it's saying I don't have enough room.
2008-04-26T07:04:00.000Z	ffm_	TheFearsomeFufu	Uh, how much free space is on the disk?
2008-04-26T07:04:00.000Z	TheFearsomeFufu	ffm_	1.2 GB.
2008-04-26T07:05:00.000Z	ffm_	TheFearsomeFufu	Uh, you can remove software that you arn't using...
