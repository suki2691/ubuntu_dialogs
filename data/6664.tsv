2012-01-28T00:36:00.000Z	hydrox24	gh0strider	not bad, but I am waiting for the latest TF2 patch to finish DLing so that is a little dissappointing.
2012-01-31T05:54:00.000Z	hydrox24	gh0strider	so what was the original question about Denial of service attacks?
2012-01-31T05:56:00.000Z	gh0strider	hydrox24	it really wasn't a question about "DoS" attacks it was more of question about networking and routing
