2006-08-20T16:23:00.000Z	flubs	FourPointNine	Do you just want to remove Ubuntu or replace it with something else?
2006-08-20T16:24:00.000Z	flubs	FourPointNine	I can't speak for any other linux distros, but if you were thinking about windows xp it would go through the process of formatting the drive for you when you install it
