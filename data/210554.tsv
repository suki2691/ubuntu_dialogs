2010-09-29T06:21:00.000Z	IDWMaster		I'm working on porting some networking stuff for my business from windows to Ubuntu. It was originally written in .NET, so I was considering MonoDevelop; then I heard of KDevelop (C++), which also worked amazingly well. So I was wondering if anything is 'better' about using KDevelop or MonoDevelop as an IDE.

2010-09-29T06:23:00.000Z	AlbertoP	IDWMaster	for C++, use eclipse + CDT. Much better than whatever else
2010-09-29T06:24:00.000Z	AlbertoP	IDWMaster	not sure, but you can simply pull mono from their original repos, which has the last developments
