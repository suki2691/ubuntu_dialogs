2006-12-11T14:26:00.000Z	starz	floating	if you dont need _too_ much control try btlaunchmanycurses.bittornado [options from cli bt]  /path/to/dir
2006-12-11T14:27:00.000Z	floating	starz	how does it work having multiple torrents at once, like 5 or more
2006-12-11T14:30:00.000Z	starz	floating	ive found it works fine
