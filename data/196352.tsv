2006-03-08T07:13:00.000Z	Krillancello		Now... suggestions for apt-get'ing just X and Gnome?
2006-03-08T07:14:00.000Z	mjr	Krillancello	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2006-03-08T07:14:00.000Z	Krillancello	mjr	ubuntu-desktop has too much bloat for me. It's the same as not doing the server install, so what's the point?
