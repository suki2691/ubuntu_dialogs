2008-04-21T12:19:00.000Z	MEtaLpREs		just make the folders network shares
2008-04-21T12:20:00.000Z	MEtaLpREs		then the folders will be visable to any other machine on the network
2008-04-21T12:22:00.000Z	Rainarrow	MEtaLpREs	thanks, but what's the CLI equivalent of the operation? Since I may want to exchange some .conf files between two my two boxes, and sudo is more convenient than gksudo for me
2008-04-21T12:23:00.000Z	Rainarrow	MEtaLpREs	ok, thanks
