2007-12-15T09:08:00.000Z	tehm0nk		primary/extended...etc
2007-12-15T09:09:00.000Z	tehm0nk		can the partitions all be incased in an extended?
2007-12-15T09:10:00.000Z	kelsin	tehm0nk	you can only have 4 primary partitions, One of those can be an extended partition, then you can make as MANY more as you want in the extended (these are called the Logical partitions)
