2008-04-06T15:28:00.000Z	esteth	[[thufir]]	It means you need to add something to the conf files at /etc/apache2, assuming apache2
2008-04-06T15:28:00.000Z	esteth	[[thufir]]	most probably apache2.conf or httpd.conf
2008-04-06T15:29:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	esteth	I think I found it.  Maybe it's me, but the manual for phpmyadmin isn't helpful.  thanks, though.
