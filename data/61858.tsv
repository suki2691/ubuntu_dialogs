2009-09-06T00:43:00.000Z	hmmwhat		maybe someone can help me here, I got a computer that I need to set up, prob is no one knows the login/passwd, so i can get in, ive loooked on the net on how to crack it, but it keeps asking me for a root maintenance password
2009-09-06T00:44:00.000Z	grawity	hmmwhat	There are two ways, changing the root password with a LiveCD, and changing it with init=/bin/sh
2009-09-06T00:46:00.000Z	grawity	hmmwhat	Does the PC have some important data you need to copy? Or could you just reinstall the entire OS?
