2012-07-06T11:26:00.000Z	icewalker		is ubuntu 12.04 x64 default video driver optimizes for dell e6420 or do i need to install bumblebee?
2012-07-06T11:27:00.000Z	iceroot	icewalker	is that using nvidia ion?
2012-07-06T11:28:00.000Z	iceroot	icewalker	the default drivers and also the nonfree driver ubuntu is offering for nvidia ion is not the best solution, so bumblebee is the way to go
2012-07-06T11:31:00.000Z	iceroot	icewalker	there is a bubmlebee ppa, just enable that ppa and install the bumblebee package after that restart x (or the complete system)
