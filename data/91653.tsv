2008-11-18T01:30:00.000Z	powertool08	joaopinto	but doesn't rm -rf screw up more than fstab?
2008-11-18T01:30:00.000Z	joaopinto	powertool08	he was asking about a problem he had corrupting the fstasb, and if it should remove the root or not
2008-11-18T01:31:00.000Z	powertool08	joaopinto	ok, didn't see that just, just the rm command and "computer go chug chug"
