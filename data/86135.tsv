2010-10-07T14:00:00.000Z	ElCerebr0		I installed Ubuntu 10.04 on a old dell dimension 4300 desktop and am having problems with the sound...
2010-10-07T14:01:00.000Z	ElCerebr0		it is very choppy and does not like to play mp3s
2010-10-07T14:02:00.000Z	Submarine	ElCerebr0	I'm unsure about the 'choppy' issue, but mp3s are not an issue as long as the players are fully installed.
