2010-05-29T19:55:00.000Z	Taina__		Hi, I'm new to the Linux scene.. I'm fairly good with computers but after a 10.04 and a couple of successful boots, the system froze and I had to try an shut it down via the power button. Now on launch I get various messages from grub(?) like 'Unknown filesystem' I'm really lost. Also my windows boot is messed and /fixmbr /fixboot isn't solving it. Though it did once in my efforts. Any help? I mainly want Ubuntu up and running again.

2010-05-29T19:57:00.000Z	Taina__		Okay, I'll do that now
