2006-04-04T14:36:00.000Z	croftyboy_30		I am having problems with macromedia flash on ubuntu 5.04,the flash programme comes up and there is no text on the screen like the font is the same colour at the background
2006-04-04T14:37:00.000Z	anstei	croftyboy_30	this looks like you don't have the fonts that flash uses
2006-04-04T14:37:00.000Z	anstei	croftyboy_30	try downloading mstcorefonts from the multiverse repository
2006-04-04T14:41:00.000Z	anstei	croftyboy_30	did you enable the multiverse repository?
