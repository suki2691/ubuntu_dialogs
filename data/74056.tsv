2008-11-18T17:02:00.000Z	inflex		is there a NFS share/export management tool for Ubuntu ?
2008-11-18T17:02:00.000Z	inflex		(so I can share various directories to other Ubuntu boxes)
2008-11-18T17:03:00.000Z	Sektor__	inflex	I believe SAMBA can help you with that
2008-11-18T17:03:00.000Z	Sektor__	inflex	but that might be for the other way around, to access ubuntu box from windows
