2007-05-18T06:26:00.000Z	sebas_	hilts50	a friend of mine is installing Ubuntu in his computer completely uninstalling Windows, but the installation stops at 15% when checking the file systems. Can you help me, please?
2007-05-18T06:27:00.000Z	hilts50	sebas_	have you reformated the drive before installing?
2007-05-18T06:27:00.000Z	sebas_	hilts50	how should I reformat it?
2007-05-18T06:28:00.000Z	sebas_	hilts50	it's okay now, thanks anyway.
