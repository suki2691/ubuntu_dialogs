I heard OCR often causes formatting problems and errors, but these books don't seem to have any problems at all. Can this be done in ubuntu? Thanks

2012-02-25T18:17:00.000Z	nullucas	LjL	maybe... I just got the impression that there are even old or rare books that are well formatted, which probably don't even exist as pdf for sale. I don't know... But if that's true, then I guess a good OCR software is the only way to go
