2012-08-28T17:45:00.000Z	SinTaX98		I'm trying to build a kernel from source on 12.04 server, but when I run make xconfig I get "qconf: cannot connect to X server", does that mean I need a GUI installed?
2012-08-28T17:46:00.000Z	jrib	SinTaX98	or don't use qconf...
2012-08-28T17:48:00.000Z	SinTaX98	jrib	I am trying to build a kernel with more driver support for a tftp boot /fog environment.  I have been looking for a way to do so, but the only way I can seem to find is qconf.  Is there another (possibly better) way?
