2006-11-14T11:03:00.000Z	Acu		Hey guys I have a pdb book and I cannot open it - any hint ?
2006-11-14T11:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Acu	probably a Palm format
2006-11-14T11:05:00.000Z	Acu	Flannel	yes it might be a Palm format, but how the heck I can open it in linux?
2006-11-14T11:06:00.000Z	Flannel	Acu	no idea, look for a linux palm book reader (although, there are a few palm formats)
