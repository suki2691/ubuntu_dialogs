2008-04-26T00:01:00.000Z	nucco	Darre1	you probably need the firmware
2008-04-26T00:01:00.000Z	nucco	Darre1	I hear its supported in current kernels, but you still need firmware
2008-04-26T00:07:00.000Z	Darre1	nucco	i've tried installing via ndiswrapper, and using the "fw-cutter" method to install the drivers in the /lib/firmware directory, but still nothing shows up when I try to connect!
