2005-08-04T11:34:00.000Z	sijmen		So.. what's the easyest way to enable my second monitor on an nVidia card?
2005-08-04T11:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	sijmen	 last i tried that  the silly thing defaulted to the wrong monitor as my 'default' :P
2005-08-04T11:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	sijmen	 theres 2 ways to get it going as far as i know. the xcinerama stuff and then nvidias own method. :P i gave up soon afterwards and cant tell ya more.
