2009-11-12T05:59:00.000Z	MoTec		Is there anyway to get gnome terminal to remember my settings? for example.. I want it to start max size, with no menu bar..  It did it in 8.04 but it's not in 9.10
2009-11-12T05:59:00.000Z	MoTec		Motec: Edit the shortcut to read gnome-terminal --maximize --no-menubar

2009-11-12T06:01:00.000Z	MoTec	tonyyarusso	aah, i see. thanks
