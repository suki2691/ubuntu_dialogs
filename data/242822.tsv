2005-04-18T05:46:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm		hrm.. how do i see what to remove to get rid of old unused kernels again? updated to k7 and want to be rid of the 386 ones cluttering me up
2005-04-18T05:47:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm		i suppose it could.. i'm just more used to doing things hands-on (i originally started back into linux with gentoo, so i'm more used to dealing with command line :))
2005-04-18T05:48:00.000Z	diego	i0n_st0rm	i wasn't trying to say that gentoo is bad for it. i think it's wonderful for learning, but i'm here in #ubuntu because _most_ of that hands-on work is done for me on ubuntu and i can just _use_ the os
2005-04-18T05:50:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	diego	i was just saying that i'm more used to doing everything hands-on, so i try that route first :)
