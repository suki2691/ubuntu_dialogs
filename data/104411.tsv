2009-04-08T14:26:00.000Z	axyjo		hi all, can some bash wizard help me out? i want to recursively remove all files, except for the .svn folder, and except for one particular subfolder. someone did this for me before using find, but i don't remember how to do it now. thanks.

2009-04-08T14:28:00.000Z	axyjo	ActionParsnip	there are many subfolders, so i'd prefer a script. + the .svn folder is hidden
2009-04-08T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	axyjo	doesnt matter if its hidden or not, all folders starting with . are hidden
