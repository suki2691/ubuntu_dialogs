2009-12-18T23:14:00.000Z	nbaca		hello everybody... how do I mess with the default gdm settings when nobody is logged in? I would like my laptop to not hibernate when I close the lid at the login screen

2009-12-18T23:16:00.000Z	nbaca	Dr_Willis	I tried running gconf-editor as gdm but there were no settings available... tried as root too but no change
2009-12-18T23:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nbaca	 it wouldent be as root. it would be as gdm.  Other then that. Not sure how else to tweak them.
