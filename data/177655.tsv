2008-12-14T02:14:00.000Z	mrprowse		anybody notice that there's no /feisty folder at archive.ubuntu.com? I'm trying to apt-get update and I get errors no matter how I setup my sources.list
2008-12-14T02:15:00.000Z	mrprowse		OK, but why is there still a dapper subfolder?
2008-12-14T02:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mrprowse	Feist is dead.. as in end of life and no longer supported
2008-12-14T02:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mrprowse	there are the old repos
