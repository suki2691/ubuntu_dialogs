2007-03-15T09:55:00.000Z	Flannel	jbwan	You've enabled root.  By default, root is locked, and please don't advocate people set a root password in this channel (not that you werE)
2007-03-15T09:56:00.000Z	jbwan	Flannel	I find it better to set root and make my own account a regular user... but that's just personal preference
2007-03-15T09:56:00.000Z	Flannel	jbwan	that's fine.  Please don't recommend it here.
