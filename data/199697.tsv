I read that there are no "SD card drivers" out there... but at the same time I read that people happily access their SD-Cards via a USB-Card reader. I was always under the impression that there is no other way to read such a card via USB. I do have a USB Card reader and I am not able to read my SD-Card. So am I doing something wrong or what? If I connect the SD-Card
