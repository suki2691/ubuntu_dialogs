2011-10-23T03:48:00.000Z	Archos-Owner		i have an MP3 player that doesn't automount in ubuntu. (running gnome desktop) i just discovered by accident that, if i am logged onto the computer in my daughter's account, it automounts fine as soon as you plug in the USB ... so what hidden config file do i need to delete to get it to work again on my account?

2011-10-23T03:50:00.000Z	Archos-Owner	xangua	does deleting the prefs file sound like the best idea, or should i go into change the prefs somewhere?
