2007-12-20T17:57:00.000Z	simimi		I was wondering, if I installed the x86 edition, yet have a 64 bit processor (dual core), the system is not making full use of the resources available, correct? I know I could change my kernel, but would changing my kernel to reflect this remove my ability to run 32 bit software?

2007-12-20T17:58:00.000Z	PriceChild	simimi	you are not losing much in your current state, and it probably isn't worth the bother
2007-12-20T17:58:00.000Z	simimi	PriceChild	so there is no way to take advantage of anything without reinstalling... ohh ok then, no worries
