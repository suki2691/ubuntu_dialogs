2008-12-03T10:53:00.000Z	error404notfound		how can I check if my processor is HT or DualCore or Core2Duo?
2008-12-03T10:54:00.000Z	david_	error404notfound	syslog has that info but im sure there's a better way
2008-12-03T10:55:00.000Z	david_	error404notfound	 cat /proc/cpuinfo
2008-12-03T10:55:00.000Z	error404notfound	david_	that I think gives same info for HT or Dual Core or Core 2 Duo
