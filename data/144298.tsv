2007-03-16T13:07:00.000Z	keyser_soze		i'm having a lot of trouble with fonts... I had the MS core fonts working, but wanted to add other truetype fonts... i copied all to /home/USER/.fonts and sudo fc-cache -fv... now the core fonts don't work, and neither do the truetypes... i just get boxes.  any ideas?

2007-03-16T13:09:00.000Z	keyser_soze	Stormx2	I did that, that's where they are. they're just not caching... I can't even open them in a font viewer
