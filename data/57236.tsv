2012-03-29T03:22:00.000Z	mobilenoob11		I'm going to backup ubuntu with rsync, anyone see a problem with doing the whole drive, as in "/" ?
2012-03-29T03:23:00.000Z	ejv	mobilenoob11	besides being unnecessary? i'd limit the backup to /etc /home and /var personally

2012-03-29T03:29:00.000Z	ejv	mobilenoob11	good luck
