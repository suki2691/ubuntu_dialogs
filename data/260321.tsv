2009-03-18T12:18:00.000Z	pyrohotdog		I have a syntax error in my kboot.conf, and I've been dropped into busybox. I know what I need to fix, but nano says command not found!
2009-03-18T12:19:00.000Z	pyrohotdog		How do I invoke and editor in busybox to fix the file?
2009-03-18T12:21:00.000Z	pyrohotdog		Anyone? How can I edit files in busybox?
