2006-12-27T13:10:00.000Z	Aardwolf		I have "ubuntu", not "kubuntu" but would like to use KDE, how can I install KDE on it?
2006-12-27T13:10:00.000Z	AlexC_	Aardwolf	"sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop"
2006-12-27T13:11:00.000Z	AlexC_	Aardwolf	but beware when you uninstall it, it can mess up Gnome ( happened twice to me now )
