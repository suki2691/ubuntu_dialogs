2008-03-08T08:15:00.000Z	dcsquare		I'm using edubuntu 7.10, and i hanged while doing updates. I reset the system and now, after successfully logging in, the desktop/icons etc do not load. The mouse is functional, but the rest of the system is iddle
2008-03-08T08:17:00.000Z	dcsquare		where can I check where the system hangs so I get an idea of what is broken?
2008-03-08T08:17:00.000Z	sfears	dcsquare	when it starts to boot press ctrl+alt+f1
2008-03-08T08:20:00.000Z	dcsquare	sfears	I can kill X, no problem. Now the system is not frozen, it's just that X does not finish loading
