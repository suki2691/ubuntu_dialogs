2006-01-21T14:28:00.000Z	Abecedarian	mcdenyer	 My first time using Ubuntu I had EXACTLY the same question.
2006-01-21T14:31:00.000Z	Abecedarian	mcdenyer	 I wasn't saying "read the guide".  I was giving you a link to the exact spot where it talks about it...  It is a big piece of work, and I haven't read it yet either.
