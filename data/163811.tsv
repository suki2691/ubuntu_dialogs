2006-12-19T09:53:00.000Z	Crescendo		I have a bunch of MP3s that aren't labeled properly or not at all - what can I use to label them?  Perhaps according to filename?
2006-12-19T09:54:00.000Z	SilentDis	Crescendo	 you can edit labels in xmms... but there's gotta be an 'easy to use' script for it... i haven't found it either :P
2006-12-19T09:54:00.000Z	Crescendo	SilentDis	yeah, exactly.  I'm using Rhythmbox, and looking for the same thing. ;)
2006-12-19T09:59:00.000Z	SilentDis	Crescendo	 there's a website with a tool that does it.  let me google a bit...
