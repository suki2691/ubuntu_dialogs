2010-04-07T15:01:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		Hi all. I'm running Ubuntu 9.10 in a VM, but I have to actually log into Gnome before the screen resizes itself to match my native resolution. How can I configure gdm (and the kernel, at boot) to use the same display settings as my gnome session?

2010-04-07T15:04:00.000Z	CuriosTiger	mertle	OK, I'll give that a shot
