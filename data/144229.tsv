2007-07-09T12:32:00.000Z	Anlar	lhuynh	launchpad. just add it in there, Rosetta will take care
2007-07-09T12:33:00.000Z	lhuynh	Anlar	you mean the Rosetta people will take care of it?
2007-07-09T12:33:00.000Z	Anlar	lhuynh	well no, but it's a good way to make it easy for anyone to contribute.. then just hit for instance some forums to build awareness.. and if you're lucky, tomorrow at this time it's all done
