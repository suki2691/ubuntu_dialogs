2011-04-19T15:52:00.000Z	DJones	ndxtg	http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/osmosis.net.au Says its up
2011-04-19T15:53:00.000Z	ndxtg	DJones	razz1: are you living in Australia? I know it's accessible from outside but not sure inside the country (TPG ISP to be specific)
2011-04-19T15:54:00.000Z	DJones	ndxtg	I'm in the uk, you might be better asking in #ubuntu-au, probably more chance of finding somebody in Australia in that channel
