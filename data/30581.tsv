2011-12-04T18:43:00.000Z	sandertje		hi guys... i once installed something by compiling it (OpenFTD), but since that service is now banned in my country, I'd like to uninstall it. How do I uninstall something that's not a package?

2011-12-04T18:44:00.000Z	sandertje	jrib	there's no manual page for it
2011-12-04T18:44:00.000Z	jrib	sandertje	software has no documentation?  (not necessarily man page)
