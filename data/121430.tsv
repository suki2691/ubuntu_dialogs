2007-10-23T19:17:00.000Z	Hideme	CapaH	 it is enabled.    an Nvidia card, restricted drivers are enabled and compiz is working.
2007-10-23T19:18:00.000Z	CapaH	Hideme	I thought you might say Nvidia. I have heard someone else in this room with the same problem who had Nvidia and they got it worked out, sadly I did not pay attention to the conversation -- but I hope that gives you at least a starting point
