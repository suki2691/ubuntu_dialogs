2012-04-14T02:38:00.000Z	bunnyfun		am i correct  that this is an nvidia software problem?
2012-04-14T02:38:00.000Z	ResQue	bunnyfun	sounds like the nvidia driver tried to access memory it was not supposed to . or something else accessed in memory address when it was not allowed to. so the kernal through a segfault to stop it
