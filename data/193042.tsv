2007-02-27T17:28:00.000Z	techie1		good morning all.
2007-02-27T17:29:00.000Z	techie1		still "planning" my ubuntu install.  I have a 55.8g with 24.10 space. Windows xp is partitioned in FAT32. I want to do a dual boot Ubuntu and Windowsxp. What's the best partition program or way to do so before installing Ubuntu?
2007-02-27T17:30:00.000Z	techie1		I would like to allocate half of my free space 12 gig to each
