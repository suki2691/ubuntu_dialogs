2005-04-23T12:32:00.000Z	Cwiiis		Can anyone tell me what the name of the next Ubuntu release will be? I couldn't find it with wiki searches... Also, does anyone know if there's an apt archive with slightly older debs? I need the nvidia 6xxx series driver, but I can't find all old enough packages, the CD doesn't have the k7 packages and I'd rather not build it myself

2005-04-23T12:35:00.000Z	Cwiiis	mjg59	Is there a way to search this morgue? I don't know what date these drivers were updated... And does this covere the restricted repo?
