2009-08-04T16:25:00.000Z	kaini	innomen	kill -9
2009-08-04T16:28:00.000Z	kaini	innomen	kill -9 will simply remove the process from the ram and stop executing it. everything is away if you kill for example openoffice with that
2009-08-04T16:28:00.000Z	kaini	innomen	you have to call kill -9 pid while pid is the process id of the process
