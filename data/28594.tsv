2010-09-03T07:00:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jangell	why
2010-09-03T07:01:00.000Z	jangell	ilovefairuz	because I don't have hte time to figure out why it's so damn restrictive with mysql and file limits
2010-09-03T07:03:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jangell	you could disable mysql profile only if it's giving you that much headache, if this is just a development machine, don't bother
