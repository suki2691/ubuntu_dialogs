2009-04-18T19:56:00.000Z	kazagistar		I am able to run a full Debian installation on my comp, but would rather run Ubuntu... every time I try to install or run 8.10 or 9.04 from a normal, alternate, or even server CD, I get an instant kernel panic. Any ideas?
2009-04-18T19:56:00.000Z	scunizi	kazagistar	what's the motherboard chipset?  nvidia? 8200?
2009-04-18T19:58:00.000Z	kazagistar	scunizi	its the new one from Intel, for the i7 processor
