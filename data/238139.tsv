2005-08-27T15:20:00.000Z	simplex3		Anyone using Eclipse on Ubuntu?  More specifically, PHPeclipse?
2005-08-27T15:21:00.000Z	Lars_G	simplex3	I am using it in Gentoo, but ask anyhow, see if I can help.
2005-08-27T15:22:00.000Z	simplex3	Lars_G	I'm having issues getting autocomplete and debugging working.  The PHPeclipse plugin won't let me add an interpreter and everything I find on the web is centered around doing it with Windows
2005-08-27T15:23:00.000Z	Lars_G	simplex3	Hmm, interpreters, that is explainable, but the autocomplete is really weird...
