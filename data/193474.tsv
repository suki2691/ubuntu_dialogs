2006-07-18T14:38:00.000Z	Jesus		All: my Delete button got redefined as $xscreensaver-command -lock. It's pretty annoying, anyone know how to undo that?
2006-07-18T14:39:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Jesus	xmodmap /usr/share/xmodmap/xmodmap.us (if you have a us keyboard) Type that in console
2006-07-18T14:42:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Jesus	you have a standard keyboard, not some microsoft/logitech thing?
2006-07-18T14:45:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Jesus	maybe its got some key modification thing that is messing with your delete key.
