2005-01-02T12:19:00.000Z	drspin		I'm getting ready to try out ubuntu and if I like it I'll install it today...
2005-01-02T12:20:00.000Z	drspin		is linux able to read/write NTFS reliably yet?
2005-01-02T12:21:00.000Z	xevil	drspin	as far as I know NTFS can be read but not written to in linux
2005-01-02T12:22:00.000Z	drspin	xevil	I know that's how it used to be... shame I have a 50GB partition filled with music that I won't be able to modify :/
