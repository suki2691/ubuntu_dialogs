2008-05-20T01:11:00.000Z	Steve-cal		I was trying to update some of my core system stuff, and I got an error saying it could not resolve a dependency on "libdb4.6++", which is not in any of the repos I'm currently subscribed to. Does any one know if this package exists in any repo?

2008-05-20T01:17:00.000Z	danbhfive	Steve-cal	main
2008-05-20T01:19:00.000Z	Steve-cal	danbhfive	RoAkSoAx: But I have "main" enabled in the software sources program all ready--is that what you mean?
