2008-04-30T10:41:00.000Z	Don_Miguel		Hi again, it has been another 1/2 hour or so, and I am repeating, with an update:
2008-04-30T10:41:00.000Z	Don_Miguel		Repeat #2: Problem: IDE (working) partitions not visible after Gutsy net-upgrade to Hardy on SATA  Note: those IDEs still show in BIOS, but NOT in partition manager ! see update after "sudo fdisk -l"  Paste: http://pastebin.com/m4175c259
2008-04-30T10:43:00.000Z	Don_Miguel		Flannel suggested that they SHOULD be mapped as SATA
2008-04-30T10:43:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	Don_Miguel	all drives are considered scsi now
