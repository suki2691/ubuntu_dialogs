I purchased a 'media recovery disk' from gateway to restore my computer back to windows 7 and I am suppose to receive my disk today so, when I insert the disk will Ubuntu realize what's going on and format my drives completely and then let the CD install Windows 7?

2011-02-10T22:56:00.000Z	kmck	aeon-ltd	how do you do that? boot from the CD?
2011-02-10T22:57:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	kmck	change your BIOS boot order
