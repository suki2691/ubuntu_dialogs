2007-09-26T15:12:00.000Z	DShepherd	MongooseWA	i dont think bluefish can do java and python.
2007-09-26T15:14:00.000Z	DShepherd	MongooseWA	eclipse does java. not sure if it does python. its a good ide too. does c too i think.
2007-09-26T15:15:00.000Z	DShepherd	MongooseWA	it seems to do python too. you just have to install the right plugin. you can search in synaptic for eclipse too.
