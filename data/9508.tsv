2011-12-03T23:20:00.000Z	omido	ThinkT510	 well . from what i've seen IRC is used to promote google . cause "google it" is what linux irc people tell me most of the time
2011-12-03T23:22:00.000Z	ThinkT510	omido	you said you were a "noob" so i thought "google it" wouldn't be very helpful to you since i assumed you weren't sure what you are looking for; sorry if i'm wrong
2011-12-03T23:23:00.000Z	omido	ThinkT510	no. you are right . i just think that IRC is invented by google ;p
