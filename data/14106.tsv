2011-06-21T12:17:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	maxy1	deleted pulse audio? Oh my... You will have issues - sorry I cannot resolve them
2011-06-21T12:22:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	maxy1	you may need to re-install pulse audio!
2011-06-21T12:24:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	maxy1	- there may be no way you can get support unless you have a 'default' ubuntu install
