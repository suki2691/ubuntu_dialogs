2012-01-07T18:33:00.000Z	chmac		On a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being totally dementedly crazy and 10 being absolutely 100% safe, how sensible would it be to upgrade to precise now, on my main, personal / work laptop?
2012-01-07T18:34:00.000Z	zipace	chmac	considering the new auto-upgrade option shipped on ubuntu cds, perfectly fine
2012-01-07T18:34:00.000Z	chmac	sattu94	I'm in the same boat, thinking I might skip 11.10 and go straight to precise...
2012-01-07T18:34:00.000Z	zipace	chmac	but you only want to upgrade to 11.10, right? otherwise, you might as well pour water in your CPU
