2009-09-03T05:22:00.000Z	d_b		I need to run Ubuntu Hardy Heron in VirtualBox. All I need is Firefox 3.0 and Sun Java. Any recommendations on windows managers or DE? I want it to be as light as possible but usable :)
2009-09-03T05:23:00.000Z	RandomUsr	d_b	I would use xfce for the desktop environment
2009-09-03T05:24:00.000Z	d_b	RandomUsr	wouldn't that give me alot of extra stuff I don't really need?
2009-09-03T05:24:00.000Z	RandomUsr	d_b	don't think so, it's meant to be lightweight
