2009-05-22T00:11:00.000Z	Dulak	Artissimo	sorta, init.d is the dir that contains the scripts to run at boot, so it's more like /Library/LaunchDaemons than launchd
2009-05-22T00:12:00.000Z	Artissimo	Dulak	: ah
2009-05-22T00:13:00.000Z	Dulak	Artissimo	init is sort of the launchd of linux, doesn't work anything like launchd really but serves the same sort of function
