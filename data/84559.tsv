2009-12-13T10:52:00.000Z	dpic		My webcam seems to work fine other than using it with flash. After allowing a website to access my webcam through flash, it works for a second, but there's no sound. Then the image freezes, and the webcam doesn't work until i reboot my machine. Any ideas on what's causing this?
