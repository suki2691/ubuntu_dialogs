2012-03-27T05:45:00.000Z	dsnyders		Hi all!  Is there a relatively easy way of telling if two folders are identical?
2012-03-27T05:45:00.000Z	Xabster	dsnyders	identical contents?
2012-03-27T05:47:00.000Z	dsnyders	Xabster	Identical contents, bytewise.  When I get a new hard drive I copy the old one onto the new.  I'm several copies deep now with many duplicate folders, and I want to clean things up.
