2008-11-16T14:13:00.000Z	chuckmoney	ntndo	maybe /usr/share/fonts ?
2008-11-16T14:13:00.000Z	chuckmoney	ntndo	as a general rule any kind of shared resource - icons, wallpaper, fonts, etc - is somewhere under /usr/share
2008-11-16T14:16:00.000Z	chuckmoney	ntndo	not sure.  Font support is usually per-program.  I.e. OpenOffice might but GIMP may not.  As for the window manager, GNOME, I don't know if it does or not, but if you go to System > Preferences > Appearance you can attempt to set it to a .otf font there.
