2012-09-19T02:17:00.000Z	NeNeNe		I was woundering if anyone here could kick me the right direction for setting up a PPTP VPN via cli in server 12.04? ( As in the the server is the client not a PPTP server)
2012-09-19T02:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NeNeNe	does wicd allow the forming of VPN links?
2012-09-19T02:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NeNeNe	it has a CLI interface
