I'm still trying to get UBUNTU intalled on a compact flash card, teh notebook I am installing with has 256MB RAM :( so when I try to boot the CD and clickthe INSTALL icon it just keeps thrashing away, but never really gets to completely display the install window (it may eventually)..is there a way to bot into the console via the CD and run the install that way?

2007-06-22T15:41:00.000Z	euxneks	uptownben	try xubuntu
2007-06-22T15:42:00.000Z	euxneks	uptownben	to which ubuntu features are you referring?
