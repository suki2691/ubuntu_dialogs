2008-08-08T04:15:00.000Z	TiredWolf	slammed87d21	i'm *really* afraid i can't help with wifi, but i'll still give a bit of advice anyway: describe which step of the installation you're stuck at, which errors you get if relevant, etc, and ask for guidance. "anyone good with x" hardly ever gets you anything.
