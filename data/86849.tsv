2010-11-01T11:58:00.000Z	replicasex		Depending on Unity I may switch to kubuntu >_>
2010-11-01T11:58:00.000Z	uni4dfx	replicasex	I will as soon as they switch to Unity
2010-11-01T12:01:00.000Z	uni4dfx	replicasex	well at least some easy way to create shortcuts (although even gnome isn't too good at this) and perhaps a Run As dialog
