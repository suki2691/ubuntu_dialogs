2007-06-13T12:14:00.000Z	hgh		A question about rss-feeds. I just installed Liferea and when I click one of the news in it I get like two rows of text and when I click it Firefox opens the real article. Isn't there a way to have Liferea show me the entire article right away and just read all news there? Or is rss just a "oh-there's-something-new-on-this-page-i'll-go-check-it-out-then"-thing?

2007-06-13T12:17:00.000Z	hgh	mrobbert	ok thanks. that's too bad, you should get the full article right away, less clicking that way :)
