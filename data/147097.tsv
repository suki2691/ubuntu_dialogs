2008-02-03T07:03:00.000Z	aragorn		I have a question about gnome xchat; i know this is a place for questions about ubuntu
2008-02-03T07:03:00.000Z	rainwalker	aragorn	normal xchat is better, in my opinion, but what's your question?
2008-02-03T07:04:00.000Z	aragorn	rainwalker	i have heard that before. how do you install normal xchat then?
2008-02-03T07:04:00.000Z	rainwalker	aragorn	I think you just install it with synaptic; install "xchat" instead of "xchat-gnome"
