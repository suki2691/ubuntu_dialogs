2007-04-04T11:27:00.000Z	CountDown		Two weeks ago I could record audio using the Sound Recorder application that comes standard with Ubuntu, but trying the same thing now results in a silent recording.  I don't remember changing anything about my system except making the usual security updates.  Any ideas?

2007-04-04T11:29:00.000Z	feba		Yggdrasil yes, lemme see if I can find it
2007-04-04T11:29:00.000Z	CountDown	feba	Yeah, I looked for something like that, but didn't find anything.  Where would you look?
