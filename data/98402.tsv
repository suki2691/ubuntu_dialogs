2008-10-10T00:27:00.000Z	Dougal		okies: i need some serious help with partitioning. I've got ubuntu installed on my main hard disk, but i need to make a small XP compatable partition, enough space for the XP start-up files. (I'm attempting to instal XP on my secondary hard drive)
2008-10-10T00:27:00.000Z	Dougal		Anyone able to give advice to a releative newb?

2008-10-10T00:29:00.000Z	Dougal	soundray	i'd really like the larger disk (the one that's got ubuntu on it already) to remain the primary disk if at all possible
