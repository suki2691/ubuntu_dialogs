2010-10-10T16:52:00.000Z	Tanvir		Hello I'm upgrading lucid to maverick now, will it cause any loss of my data on home folder?
2010-10-10T16:54:00.000Z	NickyJ101	Tanvir	if you do it via update manager then no
2010-10-10T16:54:00.000Z	Tanvir	NickyJ101	yes, I'm downloading via upgrade manager.
2010-10-10T16:56:00.000Z	NickyJ101	Tanvir	yep it fine that way, only issue is if you did it via a cd
