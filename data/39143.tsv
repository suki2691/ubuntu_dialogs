2010-01-12T12:41:00.000Z	Polysics		frivolous question: when i tried Kubuntu, i liked the Twitter client desklet. Is there anything like that for Gnome?
2010-01-12T12:43:00.000Z	Polysics		i will have to go and look at that :-)
2010-01-12T12:44:00.000Z	nick[0]	Polysics	there might be a gdesklet or cairo-dock twitter...then there's gwibber, and twitux, neither which I've used
