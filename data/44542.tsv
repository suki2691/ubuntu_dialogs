2009-11-15T01:36:00.000Z	Nayballs		 Hey everyone, don't suppose someone could help me solve this tiny issue that I have?.
2009-11-15T01:38:00.000Z	Nayballs		Having a problem with installing WoW, i've read the forums and such when I click on the Installer.exe it says Access denied also - It won't let me copy and paste the files onto the desktop into a folder. I can solve it by doing it as root but I REALLY don't want too do that

2009-11-15T01:40:00.000Z	furuno	Nayballs	you might want to change it from root mode nautilus tought (gksudo nautilus)
