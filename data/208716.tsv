2011-04-12T09:31:00.000Z	bret_		yea i used the live cd to repartion, and installed win7 in there, after installing it would only boot windows, did some research and reinstalled grub2 but still dont have an option to select the OS i want to access
2011-04-12T09:32:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	bret_	 can you boot to Ubuntu? maybe you just need to $ sudo update-grub2
