2006-06-02T12:19:00.000Z	Kream		i'm looking for .jigdo files/templates for the ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386 but mysteriously they're one of the few for which .jigdos are not available
2006-06-02T12:20:00.000Z	Kream		is there someone here who's involved with the ubuntu release ? or somewhere I can find them ?
