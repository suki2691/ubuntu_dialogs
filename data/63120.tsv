2010-07-09T20:19:00.000Z	yaaar		ok guys this may be dumb, but for some reason my googling skills are failing me this morning. in a postfix mail.log the delivery lines contain a chunk like "delays=0.06/0.01/0.28/0.8" and I'd like to know what each of those 4 numbers mean...I assume they are times in seconds, but what four times do they describe?
