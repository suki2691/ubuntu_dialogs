2009-06-04T21:33:00.000Z	IHS_intern		Last thing I want to accomplish this year, and I get the rest of today and half of tomorrow... how would I go about setting up a PXE server that connect to the outside world on one NIC(connecting to a network with an existing DHCP server) and serves the PXE thing on another NIC? Also, not aiming for an install, but running it sort-of like a LiveCD.
