2009-10-01T14:08:00.000Z	KoolD	firecrotch	its backtrack 4. Its based on ubuntu.
2009-10-01T14:10:00.000Z	firecrotch	KoolD	I would recommend not even trying to do the resize with older versions of resizing tools, even though ext4 is supposed to be 100% backwards compatible - there are reports of problems
2009-10-01T14:14:00.000Z	KoolD	firecrotch	so would it be alright if i try to resize with ubuntu?
