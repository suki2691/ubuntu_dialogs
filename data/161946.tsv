2006-11-03T11:42:00.000Z	Xappe	Trist_an	all visible at once? if you want terminal "multitasking", try screen
2006-11-03T11:43:00.000Z	Trist_an	Xappe	yes all visible at once. I looked at the info screen but it doesn't tell me much
2006-11-03T11:44:00.000Z	Xappe	Trist_an	don't thoink you can have the different screens in one windows though
