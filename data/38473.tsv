2010-01-25T22:59:00.000Z	Will123456		is there any reason why putting the swap partition at the front of the disk would be a bad idea?
2010-01-25T22:59:00.000Z	Will123456		why does the ubuntu installer put it on the end by default?
2010-01-25T23:00:00.000Z	Will123456		i'm about to put the swap partition at the start (before the / and /home partitions) and i'm wondering if that would affect stability at all
