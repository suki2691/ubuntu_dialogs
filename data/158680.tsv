2009-06-07T02:08:00.000Z	Slart	luc_v	yes.. stop hanging around on IRC.. go pick up a phone
2009-06-07T02:14:00.000Z	Slart	luc_v	figures.. you've managed to get the wrong irc-channel.. and you fail at using a phone..but askin #ubuntu-offtopic.. I hear they have a long list of phone numbers for ceos
2009-06-07T02:16:00.000Z	Slart	luc_v	and just in case the irony doesn't show up in your irc client... we don't care about your trade secrets or who you want to talk to.. this is a support channel for Ubuntu, anything not support related is offtopic
