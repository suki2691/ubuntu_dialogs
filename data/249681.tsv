2008-07-19T04:54:00.000Z	td123		so, I was wanting to switch somebody to ubuntu, (nub) but I'm having difficulty getting wmv support that is embedded in web pages. Is there anything that I can use?
2008-07-19T04:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	td123	 ive seen that a lot depends on the specific web page.  Some sites just do things oddly at times.

2012-05-13T19:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	td123	 seen one mentioned at the webupd8 blog site. but its not officially supported by this channel.. i just install gnome-shell on ubuntu...
