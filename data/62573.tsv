2011-09-27T11:37:00.000Z	BearCub		I checked all 3 links, and the 2nd one had me open the same sound control panel I've been using. it's set to duplex audio (1 in/1 out), and nothing is muted, but still I see no activity when I select any microphone.
2011-09-27T11:38:00.000Z	BearCub		There are maybe 5 different audio inputs in the sound cpanel such as mic 1, mic 2, mic video, and 2 others I can't recall, tried them all, no joy.
2011-09-27T11:40:00.000Z	BearCub		Does virtualbox have known issues with being unable to pass mic audio to a VM?
