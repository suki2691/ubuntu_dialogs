2007-08-09T16:01:00.000Z	lukas_t	PurpleFool	but mount also tells the mountoptions, and in fact i cant write to /media/daten2 as a normal user
2007-08-09T16:02:00.000Z	PurpleFool	lukas_t	sorry, misunderstood you, all other mount points are ok?
2007-08-09T16:03:00.000Z	lukas_t	PurpleFool	everything is mounted correctly, except for the changes i made to fstab in the last minutes
