2008-12-11T12:19:00.000Z	Severian	AlexOnRuby	So, what are the errors?
2008-12-11T12:20:00.000Z	Severian	AlexOnRuby	  without no errors would be with errors, so it is a fair question.
2008-12-11T12:22:00.000Z	Severian	AlexOnRuby	It could several things.  Maybe the mp3 files are bad.  You might not have the right totem plugin.  Have you tried vlc on the mp3 files?
