2008-04-22T05:01:00.000Z	arkanes		can anyone suggest a content filtering proxy? I'm trying to at least somewhat child-safe the internet on my kids box
2008-04-22T05:02:00.000Z	VeN0mizer	arkanes	I believe opendns.org has some form of filtering available?
2008-04-22T05:02:00.000Z	arkanes	VeN0mizer	I wanted something local that I had a little more control over, opendns was my fallback
2008-04-22T05:03:00.000Z	VeN0mizer	arkanes	there are several "Christian" ISP proxies available...but I'm not sure if they can barter with you if you have HSI :/
