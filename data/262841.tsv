2007-01-30T09:30:00.000Z	Epistax		Question: What's the difference between the nvidia and nvidia-glx package, and when I download the installer from NVidia directly, is it installing both?
2007-01-30T09:32:00.000Z	Epistax		Oh well. I'm going to try installing nvidia glx legacy one more time, and it if decides to break nvidia legacy, that's it no more ubuntu for me. :P
