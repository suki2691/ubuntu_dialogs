2009-02-23T22:53:00.000Z	sipior	alarm	this a 64-bit install?
2009-02-23T22:53:00.000Z	sipior	alarm	you'll need to fetch the 64-bit version from sun. it's not currently packaged for ubuntu
2009-02-23T22:54:00.000Z	sipior	alarm	someone might have a repository with it, i haven't checked in a while. might be worth a googling.
