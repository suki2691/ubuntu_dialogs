2005-05-21T16:09:00.000Z	oska	firas	tried xmms and didn't seem to have that ability but from the web-surfing I've been doing for last coupla hours dimly remember about some plugin to xmms that might give the option
2005-05-21T16:16:00.000Z	oska	firas	looks like xmms-cdread is additional package needed with xmms for cd audio playback - thanks for yr suggestion
2005-05-21T16:18:00.000Z	firas	oska	u're welcome, besides didn't do much, just got you thinkin' :)
