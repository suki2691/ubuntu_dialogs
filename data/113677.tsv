2010-04-16T04:37:00.000Z	rapha	prappl93	me, already running it
2010-04-16T04:38:00.000Z	prappl93	rapha	is it worth getting the thing in advanced or waiting the 2 weeks?
2010-04-16T04:39:00.000Z	rapha	prappl93	i have beta2 installed on 3 pcs now and apart from some minor glitches it runs very solidly (just dont run any updates!!) - i would say it is worth mainly because of the new music store
