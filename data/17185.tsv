2011-10-27T01:55:00.000Z	jmark		quick question: what is the command for deleteing a directory in the terminal?
2011-10-27T01:55:00.000Z	jmark		will that delete all contained files also?
2011-10-27T01:56:00.000Z	jmark		wait is it yes or no?
2011-10-27T01:56:00.000Z	Polah	jmark	just use rm -r, ignore Carri0n's suggestion.
