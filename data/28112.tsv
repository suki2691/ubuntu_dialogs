2010-08-07T16:07:00.000Z	Kedare		Is there a way on Ubuntu to know how much power a usb port consume ?
2010-08-07T16:09:00.000Z	Kedare		yep but I would like to get the power consumption of a certain port depending on what is plugged in
2010-08-07T16:10:00.000Z	bareego	Kedare	usb 2 WAS 500ma USB 3 900mA
2010-08-07T16:08:00.000Z	bareego	Kedare	they're rated to 300ma max iirc
