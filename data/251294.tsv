2006-11-29T09:09:00.000Z	aleka		I have a very silly question.. but I am a NooB, so excuse my ignorance... I am sitting at an XP machine connected to my Ubuntu machine at home via ssh, I have a file(tar.gz) on the Xp machine that I want to Xfer to my Ubuntu machine... how do I do that.. i looked into scp, but that looks like it would work the other way

2006-11-29T09:10:00.000Z	VSpike	aleka	use winscp
