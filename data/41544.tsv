2012-01-22T18:44:00.000Z	ssta	stavrosLinux	lots of stuff should be clearer.  If you change the name now after this long, lots of stuff will be less clear
2012-01-22T18:45:00.000Z	ssta	stavrosLinux	amd basically "invented" the 64bit architecture for the x86 line of chips (or at least were the fist to have one), I don't think it's wrong to reflect that in the name
