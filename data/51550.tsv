2012-09-09T06:47:00.000Z	Nautilus		I burned some DVD-Rs on ubuntu (using K3B) but my XP system doesn't recognize that there's anything on them.  Any ideas why?
2012-09-09T06:48:00.000Z	mysteriousdarren	Nautilus	what are you trying to do with it?
2012-09-09T06:49:00.000Z	mysteriousdarren	Nautilus	try to boot from it
2012-09-09T06:50:00.000Z	mysteriousdarren	Nautilus	oh sorry thought it was maybe a ubuntu or something xp can't read
