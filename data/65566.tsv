2009-03-06T08:50:00.000Z	Mike94287		I recently put Ubuntu on an old computer of mine with very little RAM. Unfortunately it's still running slow so I was considering removing Ubuntu and putting Debian on the computer with gnome so there's less stuff on the computer. Can someone tell me if this would make a difference?

2009-03-06T08:51:00.000Z	Mike94287	mezquitale	I know xubuntu is lightweight but I'm not sure if it would make a big difference from what I've heard. The only thing the computer is used for is internet browsing and piding.
