2009-09-02T09:36:00.000Z	becki		Hey all, 2 fairly complex problems:        1. I have an Averatec c3500, running Jaunty, and my USB ports don't work. Any ideas?      2. Is there any relatively easy way to program iPhone apps in Ubuntu? I would love to actually use the developer's kit that Apple provides, if possible.
