2010-03-24T01:36:00.000Z	HexGhost		let me rephrase my question in hopes of better explaining...there is a bug in ubuntu 9.04 with detecting default timezone
2010-03-24T01:36:00.000Z	HexGhost		which is causing the java jdk to report an incorrect timezone, which means my java programs are off
2010-03-24T01:37:00.000Z	Wicet	HexGhost	I doubt there would be one
2010-03-24T01:41:00.000Z	Wicet	HexGhost	I was referring to the identifying of timezone - not familiar with JDK
