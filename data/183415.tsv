2008-08-14T06:11:00.000Z	FarrisG		I'm running gutsy, with an integrated intel 965 video adapter. I know the mode is supported, but I can't get xorg to allow me to use 1280x720
2008-08-14T06:12:00.000Z	Pelo	FarrisG	open the xorg.conf file and manualy add the resolution you want to every color depts,  save and restart X
2008-08-14T06:13:00.000Z	FarrisG	Pelo	& debCarlos: So if I've done that, and it still doesn't show up as an option after I restart X? :)
2008-08-14T06:13:00.000Z	Pelo	FarrisG	pastebin your xorg.conf file
