2010-08-28T09:19:00.000Z	valbaca	ipv5	(no dumb questions) I would think it would HELP with trimming
2010-08-28T09:21:00.000Z	ipv5	valbaca	that's interesting. i guess i had envisioned its understanding of the physical layout being hampered by having contingent-appearing blocks on separate devices. glad to hear it's not an issue
