2012-07-24T20:06:00.000Z	guest-8iHnbA		Ok, I just turned my system into shit I think. Trying to guess a solution for why pulseaudio was denying connections and complaining about my /home/thedude directory "not being ours", I went and tried a chown root /home/thedude, since that didn't work I changed the ownership back to thedude, now I can't even login to thedude from the gdm, I enter the password, it starts loading and then goes back again to gdm.
2012-07-24T20:07:00.000Z	guest-8iHnbA		Is there any way to curate my home directory? I think I even did a chown -hR thedude /home/thedude, which would give ownership to the dude of all the files in that folder and subsequent folders as well.
