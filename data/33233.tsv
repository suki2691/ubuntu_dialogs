2010-05-03T05:32:00.000Z	RPG-Master		Is it normal for Rhythmbox to rip CDs at INCREDIBLY slow speeds?
2010-05-03T05:33:00.000Z	Loshki	RPG-Master	most drives will slow down if they encounter read errors. Are you sure your cd is clean?
2010-05-03T05:34:00.000Z	RPG-Master	Loshki	Yes, perfect. I'm thinking rhythmbox might use cdparanoia at a really high level
2010-05-03T05:36:00.000Z	Loshki	RPG-Master	I'm not sure what rhythmbox used. Try cdparanoia on its own?
