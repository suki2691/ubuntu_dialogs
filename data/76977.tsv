2011-10-25T09:06:00.000Z	gh0st		if I'm an apple user migrating to a linux distro what's the best one that I might be most "at home" with?
2011-10-25T09:07:00.000Z	gh0st		I guess ubuntu
2011-10-25T09:08:00.000Z	gh0st		is there a way to get the interface to resemble mac osx as close as possible?
2011-10-25T09:08:00.000Z	gulzar	gh0st	try macubuntu
