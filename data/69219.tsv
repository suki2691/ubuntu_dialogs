2009-03-04T17:28:00.000Z	elad`		How do I permanently export AL_DIR="somedir"?
2009-03-04T17:29:00.000Z	oCean_	elad`	put in in your ~/.profile
2009-03-04T17:29:00.000Z	elad`		(And if that can work from anywhere, not just from within the bash shell, that would just be super.)
2009-03-04T17:30:00.000Z	elad`	oCean_	exactly what should the line look like? The other lines in that file are odd.
