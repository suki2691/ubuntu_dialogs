2010-01-25T01:05:00.000Z	Flotonoc		Is there any reason that the workspace changer doesn't work in Ubuntu? :P
2010-01-25T01:06:00.000Z	Flotonoc		It doesn't function, then.
2010-01-25T01:06:00.000Z	Flotonoc		I can't switch between workspaces with it.
2010-01-25T01:06:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Flotonoc	has it worked before?
