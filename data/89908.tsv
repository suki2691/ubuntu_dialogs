2008-05-26T18:50:00.000Z	apo		Asking again: Crontab does not run my user's jobs, but root's fine. Any ideas?
2008-05-26T18:51:00.000Z	anirudh0	apo	check syslog...it will have cron's entries
2008-05-26T18:51:00.000Z	apo	anirudh0	As I said, root runs fine, user doesn't. :P
2008-05-26T18:51:00.000Z	apo	anirudh0	That's all syslog says.
