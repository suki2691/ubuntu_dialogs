2011-09-24T10:33:00.000Z	joel135		hello #ubuntu! how do I configure my desktop to translate "example" to "google.com" when using ping, firefox etc?
2011-09-24T10:34:00.000Z	joel135		so that ping example would give me the ip 173.194.32.18, for example
2011-09-24T10:36:00.000Z	Loshki	joel135	you can add entries to /etc/hosts (which maps names into ip addresses)...
2011-09-24T10:37:00.000Z	joel135	Loshki	thanks! I'll look into it
