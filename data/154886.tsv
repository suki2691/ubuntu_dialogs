2006-12-12T09:02:00.000Z	Molly_156		Hi guys - I have somehow locked myself out of access to some of my directories by trying to change permissions.
2006-12-12T09:02:00.000Z	Molly_156		I do not have a root account enabled, but was using MC, which acts as root.
2006-12-12T09:03:00.000Z	Molly_156		I can't get into /var/www, which is what I was trying to set.
2006-12-12T09:03:00.000Z	twosouls82	Molly_156	mc setuid?
