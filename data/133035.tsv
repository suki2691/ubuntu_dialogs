2010-04-11T07:27:00.000Z	dallyboy		say ive got all my music in my Music folder, then subdirectories as artist/album ...i have album art in all my folders, but i want to rename all the JPG files...is there a way to change the name of every JPG in a directory?
2010-04-11T07:28:00.000Z	dallyboy		i want to change them all to "folder.jpg" so rockbox will recognize them on my ipod
