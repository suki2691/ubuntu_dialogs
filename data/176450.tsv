2007-04-30T05:24:00.000Z	madsen		Hey, I got problems getting ndiswrapper 1.9 and the Atheros wireless NIC in my MacBook... Any tips? I'm using Apple's driver.
2007-04-30T05:24:00.000Z	sanityx	madsen	ndiswrapper uses windows drivers
2007-04-30T05:25:00.000Z	madsen	sanityx	Yeah, I'm using the Windows XP driver CD which I burned from OS X when partitioning the drive with BootCamp.
2007-04-30T05:26:00.000Z	madsen	sanityx	So I _am_ using windows drivers... Problem is, when I try to load the ndiswrapper module, everything locks up.
