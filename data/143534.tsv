2008-10-07T14:13:00.000Z	clouder`grr	xst	try getdeb.net
2008-10-07T14:15:00.000Z	xst	clouder`grr	getdeb.net has it, but aren't there some backport-repository having it? Else, I will have to download and install a bunch of dependencies also
2008-10-07T14:16:00.000Z	clouder`grr	xst	I have no idea, no experience doing it
