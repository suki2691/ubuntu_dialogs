2010-04-07T06:31:00.000Z	RFXCasey		My wireless wasn't showing up so I followed a thread that said to go into nm-system-settings.conf and change where it said "managed=" to true, the in console do a "sudo killall nm-system-settings" and then do a "sudo nm-system settings". Now my wired connection isn't showing up either. I tried changing "managed=" back to false but both my wired and wireless connection are still broken.
