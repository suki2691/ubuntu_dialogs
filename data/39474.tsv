2010-02-04T05:12:00.000Z	Alumin		yes...kinda afk (on a call, hehe) but I'm watching my highlights :)
2010-02-04T05:15:00.000Z	Losha	Alumin	ok, the scripts in /etc/rc?.d should give you a fair idea of what gets started at what runlevel. I think the default runlevel is 2, depending on your release...
2010-02-04T05:35:00.000Z	Alumin	Losha	cool...that's what I did by hand, was just looking for something a little more "one-liner" :)
