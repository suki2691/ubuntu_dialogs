2011-11-13T23:21:00.000Z	Salihk		It sounds stupid but i created a admin account from guest session. Than i remove the other admin account. However new admin account is disabled. So i cannot enter admin session. I thinks it is huge bug. because someone who can access guest account (means everybody  does) can easily delete real admin account and blow all the system. If i can do it everybody does... How can i fix this ?

2011-11-13T23:23:00.000Z	Salihk	ssta	actually i really don't know how but it is a real. I cannot enter my admin account and delete origin user from guest session
