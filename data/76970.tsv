2009-01-09T21:33:00.000Z	Clockswork		Hello people! Is there any good textbased typing games for Ubuntu?
2009-01-09T21:34:00.000Z	Seveas	Clockswork	vim can be a real typing challenge :)
2009-01-09T21:35:00.000Z	Clockswork	Seveas	vim? Allright I'll check it out
2009-01-09T21:36:00.000Z	Seveas	Clockswork	vim isn't really a game, it's a very powerful text editor. That power comes at a cost though and it can be hard to get used to, hence the 'challenge' it is :)
