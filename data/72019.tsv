2011-10-08T03:26:00.000Z	javier_		Hi everybody. I'm about to format my harddrive and reinstall ubuntu and windows in a different partition. Two questions: 1. is there a way to automatically find/reinstall all the programs I have now? 2. Is it ok to have windows in a primary partition, / in another primary partitio and then /home and /swap in logical partition (logical from / one). Thanks!
