2010-12-24T21:54:00.000Z	harovali		hi, I installed ubuntu 10.10 in a friend's notebook, and everuthing went fine until she plugged her usb stick pendrive: nothing seems to mount when plugging it.
2010-12-24T21:54:00.000Z	rs0832	harovali	did you try manually mounting this?
2010-12-24T21:55:00.000Z	harovali	rs0832	not yet, I'll try that when I arrive there
2010-12-24T21:55:00.000Z	rs0832	harovali	sorry, arrive where? or did i miss something?
