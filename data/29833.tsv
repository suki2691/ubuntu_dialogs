2010-06-25T20:20:00.000Z	Gwar	guayja1	you need Ubuntu-Tweak and GDM2
2010-06-25T20:20:00.000Z	Gwar	guayja1	they are not in the repos iirc so you have to google them. Ubuntu Tweek will let you change the background and GDM2 will let you change the theme
2010-06-25T20:20:00.000Z	guayja1	Gwar	ok thanks,
