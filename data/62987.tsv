2009-05-17T01:46:00.000Z	p-f		Xorg uses 99% cpu whenever I type text in Texmaker. Any ideas how I could fix this?
2009-05-17T01:46:00.000Z	p-f		(cpu usage shoots up when I start typing, goes back down when I stop)

2009-05-17T01:48:00.000Z	p-f	ValentineX	the problem also shows up if I type with my feet
