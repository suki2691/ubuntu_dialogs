2007-11-01T00:44:00.000Z	minus		I've been reading some faqs and wikis, but I still don't get how Im supposed to make one of my disks to automount at startup. I don't know which settings im supposed to use in the fstab. I want it to be automounted at startup, full read/write permissions by the user id 1000 and mount/unmountable by the user id 1000. Can someone tell me how I should do?

2007-11-01T00:45:00.000Z	minus	src	never heard of it? xD
