2007-10-21T13:13:00.000Z	gezim		Guys, I shot myself in the foot. I disabled my restricted drivers for my graphics card and a bunch of stuff got uninstalled. How do I undo that?
2007-10-21T13:13:00.000Z	gezim		BTW, I can't get X running now.
2007-10-21T13:15:00.000Z	gezim		is there a way to check history of apt-getting ?
2007-10-21T13:17:00.000Z	DShepherd	gezim	you can check out /var/log/dpkg.log. that might help
