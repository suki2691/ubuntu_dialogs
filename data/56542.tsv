2010-05-18T03:10:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		is there a way to reinstall gnome-desktop and use all defaults?
2010-05-18T03:10:00.000Z	FirstSgt	SolarisBoy	i am guessing use aptitude and uninstall it, then reinstall it. (making sure to remove all conf files).
2010-05-18T03:11:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	FirstSgt	is that equal to sudo apt-get install --reinstall gnome-desktop?
2010-05-18T03:12:00.000Z	FirstSgt	SolarisBoy	yes, assuming reinstall removes conf files :)
