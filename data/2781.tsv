2012-05-30T05:34:00.000Z	escott	Shant_	have you tried logging in to tty1 and doing the mv that way? ctrl-alt-f1
2012-05-30T05:35:00.000Z	Shant_	escott	I am not sure I understand "doing the mv"
2012-05-30T05:36:00.000Z	escott	Shant_	reisio suggested you "su and then execute mv ~/.config ..." but you could also just ctrl-alt-f1, login as shant there and directly run the mv
2012-05-30T05:37:00.000Z	escott	Shant_	ctrl-alt-f7 to get back to the gui
