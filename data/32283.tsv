2010-05-24T09:27:00.000Z	mkjackson	Appl6	not really a problem but I'm basically trying to take this java project I've been studying and dump it down to text.  to lessen the page count I want to print the project 4 pages to a side, double sided but if I do it one job at a time then I will be getting alot of single pages as a little square and nothing anywhere else (making the attempt moot)
