2008-05-09T01:10:00.000Z	jaybrog		I'm trying to run windows xp inside ubuntu 8.04. I just installed VirtualBox
2008-05-09T01:11:00.000Z	jaybrog		Does anyone know how to point it to the XP partition without instaling XP again?
2008-05-09T01:11:00.000Z	Kohlrak	jaybrog	bad idea... virtual machines dont' have the same hardware and windows doesn't like hardware changes
2008-05-09T01:12:00.000Z	jaybrog	Kohlrak	thanks :)
