2011-06-24T04:18:00.000Z	Faustus2		when connecting comp A to internett through B, is it a problem that both network-cards on B has ip that starts with 10.xx.xx.x?
2011-06-24T04:19:00.000Z	histo	Faustus2	no that's a private ip
2011-06-24T04:20:00.000Z	Faustus2	histo	hmm, then i dont know what the problem is :(
2011-06-24T04:21:00.000Z	histo	Faustus2	i would try pinging 8.8.8.8 and see if it's a dns issue
