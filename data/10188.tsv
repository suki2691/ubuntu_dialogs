2012-02-09T22:01:00.000Z	wondering		good day.. Is anyone here that can help me recognize a music player.. I have a creative mp3 that when usb plugged in, isn't recognized by the My Computer???  But it is "seen" because it is charging...

2012-02-09T22:05:00.000Z	wondering		got it.. thx all.. The mp3 was dead.. dont think it had enough juice to be recognized... NOW it is.. THx all for what you do.\
