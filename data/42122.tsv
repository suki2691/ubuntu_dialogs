2009-11-21T22:59:00.000Z	serp-		I have a 64-bit Ubuntu. I want to use a .so that was built for 32-bit. What should I do?
2009-11-21T23:00:00.000Z	Billiard	serp-	i beleive the package is called getlib or getlibs it will download the libs for a program you specify
2009-11-21T23:00:00.000Z	serp-	Billiard	it is some custom non-open library...
2009-11-21T23:01:00.000Z	Billiard	serp-	getlib might like you install a 32bit library you specify not positive
