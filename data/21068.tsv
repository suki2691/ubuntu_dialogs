2011-01-04T06:47:00.000Z	yaaar		i've got a server that hangs during fsck on boot. i recognize this is likely a sign of a bigger problem, and i intend to investigate that...but i really need this thing to get up to at least limping along. is there some way to make it skip the fsck?

2011-01-04T06:48:00.000Z	JackOfHearts	yaaar	 turn of disk checking in fstab
