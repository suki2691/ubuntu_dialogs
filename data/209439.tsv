2007-12-03T04:45:00.000Z	miles8		Hi, I upgraded to Gusty, and my graphics seem pretty messed up.  Is there a good explanation as to what as going on on the backend for this screens and resolutions utility.  I would rather just bypass it all together have just use my own xorg.conf that I have manually edited
2007-12-03T04:46:00.000Z	miles8		But it seems to use that at first, and then it reverts to some different config
2007-12-03T04:46:00.000Z	miles8		Ya, I know how to manually edit it
2007-12-03T04:46:00.000Z	LjL	miles8	if you've only got *one* resolution set in xorg.conf, then i'm pretty sure gnome will use that
