2010-03-04T09:50:00.000Z	DiploCat		what is the -x ?
2010-03-04T09:51:00.000Z	brjann	DiploCat	that's a test to exist that command.sh exists
2010-03-04T09:53:00.000Z	brjann	DiploCat	no, that would in fact work in a shell. and no, it wouldn't necessarily report an error, it depends on what the rest of the cron command is
