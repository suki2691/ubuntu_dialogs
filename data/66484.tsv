2010-06-25T17:51:00.000Z	Traveler1		hello
2010-06-25T17:53:00.000Z	Traveler1		I have a graphic problem. I am getting artefacts and I believe that they are caused by missing gpu drivers. Windows xp works fine. The problem is I don't actually know what integrated driver I have. mb is Fujitsu siemens s939
2010-06-25T17:55:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Traveler1	are you still there?
