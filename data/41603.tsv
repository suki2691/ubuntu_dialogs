2009-11-30T08:52:00.000Z	kb9vqf		Usually ending with a frozen filesystem and the process accessing the disk, but sometimes even a kernel freeze (not panic, oddly enough)?

2009-11-30T08:54:00.000Z	kb9vqf	epinky	I've had the whole box go down, just the networkging go down, even X freeze.  It's always when moving lots of data over NFS, and it always requires both machines to be restarted
