2009-01-04T07:09:00.000Z	rww	wfoster_	I remember the name, but not the problem =/. If you're trying to say that OS X doesn't use sudo... umm, I hate to tell you, but it does.
2009-01-04T07:10:00.000Z	wfoster_	rww	Leopard OS X uses sudo? Well, at least it won't corrupt all the time like Wubi.
2009-01-04T07:11:00.000Z	rww	wfoster_	Yes it does, yes it might, and if I were in less of a terse mood tonight I'd PM you some of the reasons why I switched from OS X to Ubuntu. But yeah, OS X discussion is off-topic for #ubuntu, so go to ##mac.
