2006-12-25T16:26:00.000Z	Hellevator	jps	what are the disadvantages to imaging your hard drive?
2006-12-25T16:28:00.000Z	Hellevator	jps	i have an external hard drive i can place the images on.
2006-12-25T16:29:00.000Z	Hellevator	jps	I'm also worried about my windows xp cd key getting rejected.  I've already reinstalled windows xp 3 times activating with the same cd key.  Isn't there a limit to how many times you can do that?
