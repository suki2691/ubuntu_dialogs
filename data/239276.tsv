2009-06-29T09:04:00.000Z	LargePrime		Greetings.  Got a strange Problem.  Firefox spell checker is the issue.  Upon a misspelled word, If the right click KEY is pressed FF does not suggest a word.  If the MOUSE is Right Clicked on the word, it suggests a word.  The FF guys are wondering if it is a "Ubuntu Customization" Issue.  Any Ideas?

2009-06-29T09:05:00.000Z	dragon_	LargePrime	tried disabling "Ubuntu Modification Pack" plugin in Firefox?
