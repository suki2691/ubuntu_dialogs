2011-02-02T22:15:00.000Z	maco	dee01	id have /home be part of your / and then make your ntfs mount at /data, then symlink /home/dee01/Music -> /data/Music
2011-02-02T22:15:00.000Z	maco	dee01	and suchlike
2011-02-02T22:16:00.000Z	dee01	maco	aha. ok. never heard about symlink but if it will make everything running again properly, then i will be more than happy!
