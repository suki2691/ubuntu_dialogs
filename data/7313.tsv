2011-12-13T04:15:00.000Z	MahaVishnu		it does support some other devices though check the website
2011-12-13T04:16:00.000Z	Kirsch	MahaVishnu	ya and it works very well with my PS3 as of now and i didn't change any config with Mediatomb but GoogleTV threw an error (it's actually Logitech's Media Center app, it DOES play through their app I just have to browse through all the files, it could support global serach)
