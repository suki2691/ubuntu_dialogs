2008-07-06T13:50:00.000Z	Metatron_	daYZman-w	that would not be an upgrade that would be a switch
2008-07-06T13:51:00.000Z	Metatron_	daYZman-w	you could try installing your distro over top of your current, but i suspect you will have a LOT of difficulties, imagine trying to switch Vista to XP by copying over top it, you should fresh install
2008-07-06T13:53:00.000Z	daYZman-w	Metatron_	yeah i agree. but do you think if there's a repository somewhere so that i can just download and install it instead?
