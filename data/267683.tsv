2011-02-20T12:31:00.000Z	maco	Fausto	i suspect there's a plugin that lets you turn off join/part messages
2011-02-20T12:35:00.000Z	maco	Fausto	other clients (that are actually specially made for irc) allow you to make those either hidden or dimmed out so that they're easy to ignore and just read chatter but can still be read if you're trying to figure out at what point someone disappeared
