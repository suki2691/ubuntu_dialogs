2008-09-17T00:17:00.000Z	RomanaMentalis		I have an https site that warns users that the site is insecure because the certificate is invalid - do I need to purchase an ssl certificate or should I be able to generate my own

2008-09-17T00:20:00.000Z	R4kk00n	RomanaMentalis	if you generate your own your users will still get a warning saying that the certificate cannot be validated (or what it says when an issuer is unknown)
2008-09-17T00:23:00.000Z	RomanaMentalis	R4kk00n	so I have to buy one to get rid of that warning.  Will the basic model at godaddyssl.com do the trick?
