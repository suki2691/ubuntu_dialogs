2005-05-11T11:14:00.000Z	bigbill52a		i found a way to install windows on my sata drive and linux on my ide..they are totally independent of each other
2005-05-11T11:15:00.000Z	bigbill52a		so if i have to reinstall one or the other...it does not mess up the boot
2005-05-11T11:17:00.000Z	bretzel	bigbill52a	I do have WindowXP Home edition, WindowsXP pro ( see windowslsd III ) in my SATA, and then this Linux-ubuntu also in the SATA drive, Bootable-raid enabled, non-IDE mode :-)
2005-05-11T11:24:00.000Z	bretzel	bigbill52a	In my case, my bios ( ASUS P4 P800 SE ) doesn't allow bootable SATA in IDE mode... nust be in SATA-RAID-bootable ... Thus, Had to provide drivers at Windows install
