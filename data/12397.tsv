2012-02-19T04:16:00.000Z	alecbenzer		my wm keeps crashing randomly when I try to alt-tab. any ideas?
2012-02-19T04:17:00.000Z	zykotick9	alecbenzer	what WM are you using?  (i'm guessing it's really a DE, Unity perhaps?)
2012-02-19T04:19:00.000Z	alecbenzer	zykotick9	well yeah, it's the default unity stuff w/ 11.10. I just meant that wm is what seems to be fucking up (my applications stay up, but the window borders and stuff disappear)
2012-02-19T04:20:00.000Z	zykotick9	alecbenzer	i've seen others complain about ALT+TAB crashing in Unity.  I don't personally have ANY suggestions.  good luck.  (PS. nice language on ya)
