2012-02-12T10:56:00.000Z	soulf_	escott	what do you mean "just set the gconf key"? How would I do that?
2012-02-12T11:02:00.000Z	escott	soulf_	i would (a) try using gconf-editor it might still work. if it doesnt then use dconf-editor but create the key and directory based on what you see in gconf-editor schemas (alternately use gsettings cli to create and set the value)
2012-02-12T11:03:00.000Z	soulf_	escott	alright thanks, (b) it is :)
