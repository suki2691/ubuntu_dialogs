2007-06-28T16:36:00.000Z	DavidCraft		when I installed ubuntu I had in my xorg.conf a synaptic driver.  I installed a patch for my video display (to get it to display in wide screen). Now all of a sudden, the synaptics driver is not there.  How do I fix this?

2007-06-28T05:47:00.000Z	DavidCraft		I installed a package to get my i830 intel video car drive to work in wide screen mode, now my synaptic driver is gone.  How do I get it back w/o using dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg as this screws alot of stuff up.  I tried inserting the symantic stuff into teh file directly but this crashes xserver.
