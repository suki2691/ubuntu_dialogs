2006-08-01T05:24:00.000Z	tengil		i want to start a program in a screen at bootup and i do this with screen -dmS blipp /home/krasse/script.sh. this gives me a screen. however when ctrl+c to kill the program i instead kill the screen. If i manually start a screen and then start script.sh and then hit ctrl+c it does exist the program. anyone  how i can get this to work in my automatically started screen as well?
