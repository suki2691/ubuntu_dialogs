2008-04-01T13:47:00.000Z	dibblego		if I want to record the image from a webcam, what is the recommended software?
2008-04-01T13:47:00.000Z	zcat[1]	dibblego	I'd probably use vlc
2008-04-01T13:49:00.000Z	dibblego	zcat[1]	does it require some kind of plugin?
2008-04-01T13:49:00.000Z	zcat[1]	dibblego	not sure.. depends on the webcam possibly.. I have bt878 cards and analog cams here.. USB is a bit different I think
