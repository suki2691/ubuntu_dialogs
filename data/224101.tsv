2005-08-23T16:05:00.000Z	killahkosha		ok so I got my xorg all configured and whatnot, got it to where the resolutions are "2048x1536 1024x768 800x600 640x480" and i got my vertical/hortizontal refresh plugged in correctly. But when I load up gnome the only resolutions I can select are 800x600 or 640x480
