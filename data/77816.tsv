2008-10-06T07:29:00.000Z	darkjester		Can anybody help me with the problem I'm having getting 75Hz out of my LCD panel? I'm using Ubuntu 8.04 and I have a monitor running at 1440x900@60hz on an ATI Radeon 9600. I am poor of sight, so PMing me would be handy (I'm more likely to notice it).
2008-10-06T07:29:00.000Z	darkjester		Some further information: I used http://www.sh.nu/nvidia/gtf.php to get a modeline and put it in xorg.conf under Section Monitors but all that got me was Ubuntu telling me it was going into low graphics mode because it could not detect my settings.

2008-10-06T07:32:00.000Z	darkjester	codazoda	so I should put the modeline there also?
