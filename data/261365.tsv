2005-02-16T13:31:00.000Z	Manny		is it somehow possible to install ubuntu using a partitioned, formatted HD and internet access from a bootable live CD?
2005-02-16T13:31:00.000Z	Manny		I remember some manual bootstrapping with deb
2005-02-16T13:32:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Manny	 heh, I wanted net-install livecds (DEbian's net installers are 20M cds, so +20M on the livecd), that may be neat if they ever decide to make 'em
