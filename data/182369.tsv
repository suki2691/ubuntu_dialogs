2006-09-05T12:37:00.000Z	qatsi		how do i go back with an upgrade i made to some libs?
2006-09-05T12:38:00.000Z	qatsi		again: is there a way to 'revert' the upgrade i last made with synaptic ?
2006-09-05T12:39:00.000Z	stefg	qatsi	yes, restaore your last backup :-) If you don't have one you learned something for the next time .-)
2006-09-05T12:39:00.000Z	qatsi	stefg	darn, i just want xgl to work, but with the new updates, they dont :( i was using the ones who came by default with the cd, now that i upgraded, direct rendering isnt enabled
