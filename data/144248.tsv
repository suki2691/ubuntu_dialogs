2007-03-30T13:19:00.000Z	totallyscrewed		I must be doing something wrong, the help message pops up when I type: sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom
2007-03-30T13:21:00.000Z	totallyscrewed		I had forgotten to specify a mount point, but if I do, it says: unknown filesystem type "iso9660"
2007-03-30T13:23:00.000Z	Innatech	totallyscrewed	try it with the "auto" filesystem type.
