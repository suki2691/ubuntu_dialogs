2008-07-10T07:08:00.000Z	v64		I have the latest Ubuntu, Firefox, and Flash, and when I go to Yahoo Live (live.yahoo.com), which is basically a Flash webcam app, the video comes in fine, but the voices sound like they're 2 octaves too low, as if they're slowed down? I couldn't find anything on Google, has this happened to anyone?
2008-07-10T07:08:00.000Z	v64		it works fine for me on my Mac
2008-07-10T07:08:00.000Z	v64		so I know it's not a problem with the feed
