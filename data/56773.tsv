2010-01-18T12:10:00.000Z	py_		I freshly installed a karmic koala system, which is working fine. Now I want to install skype, so I added medibuntu to my sources list and updated. However, apt-cache search skype doesn't find it. Is it not supposed to be there?
2010-01-18T12:11:00.000Z	petsounds	py_	yes. but you can always download from skype website.
2010-01-18T12:14:00.000Z	py_	petsounds	thx for the hint, but my question was more like "has something changed in medibuntu that it doesn't offer skype anymore?"
