2006-03-23T10:46:00.000Z	dabaR	ACU	what share?
2006-03-23T10:51:00.000Z	ACU	dabaR	- yes both are ubuntu - I gave ip address to one as 195.168.1.1 and the other 1.2  I thought is the TCP/IP is the protocol  - I shared one folder then I went in the other computer ---Places connect to server and chose windows smb entered the IP address of the target computer and soo oon
