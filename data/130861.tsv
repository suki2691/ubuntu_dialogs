2008-08-20T10:15:00.000Z	kangyul		I have a question, I want to use vlc player to open the address:udp://@[ff18::0101:4]:8000, but it hints that: the firefox was not associated with any applications, I want to know how to deal with this.
2008-08-20T10:16:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kangyul	well open the stream with vlc, not firefox...
2008-08-20T10:18:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kangyul	uh open vlc, click file -> open stream, put in the credentials.
2008-08-20T10:24:00.000Z	arrrghhh	kangyul	did you go to open stream?
