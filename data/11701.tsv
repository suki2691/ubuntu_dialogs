2011-09-06T05:07:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ionite	yes, but ubuntu classic less so, lubuntu or xubuntu would be better
2011-09-06T05:07:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ionite	anything processing or graphic heavy (compiz/unity) would cause some slowdowns,
2011-09-06T05:07:00.000Z	ionite	aeon-ltd	lubuntu and xubuntu are XFCE? what about kDE? why would ubuntu be heavy for a netbook?
