2010-09-29T20:42:00.000Z	jags		say I want to mirror my current linux disk to a larger disk? Is this easily accomplished?
2010-09-29T20:43:00.000Z	st__	jags	just copy the files and edit partition UUID in grub on target system
2010-09-29T20:44:00.000Z	st__	jags	su[do] is the root
2010-09-29T20:46:00.000Z	st__	jags	there are only 2 level of access: user and root
