2011-04-19T21:31:00.000Z	zongo		Greeting Guys, Just moved to ubuntu 10.10 and I have an issue with one of my external drive not mounting anymore
2011-04-19T21:31:00.000Z	zongo		sudo fdisk -l is not showing the drive and nor df -h
2011-04-19T21:32:00.000Z	iceroot	zongo	bios is detecting the drive?
2011-04-19T21:32:00.000Z	iceroot	zongo	if you plugin the drive, is dmesg showing it?
