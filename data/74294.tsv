2008-11-14T14:03:00.000Z	ivarss		Hi *. Can't decide is this is server specific question or not.
2008-11-14T14:03:00.000Z	ivarss		Perhaps I am missing the obvious, but how do I include new schema files in openldap configuration? Intrepid ships with openldap v2.4 which uses new cn=config style configuration and not slapd.conf Thanks and please point me to the right direction if this is not a proper place to ask.
2008-11-14T14:04:00.000Z	joaopinto	ivarss	better ask on #ubuntu-server
2008-11-14T14:05:00.000Z	ivarss	joaopinto	thanks, will try there
