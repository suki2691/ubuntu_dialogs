2006-05-27T08:07:00.000Z	Ng	azimuth	like a USB memory card reader? they ought to Just Work
2006-05-27T08:09:00.000Z	Ng	azimuth	hmm, it ought to automount, but if it's built into the laptop it might be weird hardware and not supported :/
2006-05-27T08:09:00.000Z	Ng	azimuth	there is an ubuntu laptop team (search the wiki), perhaps they can shed some light on the issue?
