2005-03-02T13:49:00.000Z	Levander		What's the easiest way to search the ubuntu reposities? i mean the repositories main, restrice, multiverse, and universe?
2005-03-02T13:49:00.000Z	JDahl	Levander	apt-cache search if you have them in sources.list?
2005-03-02T13:50:00.000Z	JDahl	Levander	I also miss the search bots like #debian have
2005-03-02T13:51:00.000Z	Levander	JDahl	guess I'll have to add them, search, remove them if they don't have them
