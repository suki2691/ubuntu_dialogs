2007-08-16T10:15:00.000Z	therealnanotube	PCboy123	it should mount automatically when you insert a disk....
2007-08-16T10:18:00.000Z	therealnanotube	PCboy123	what happens if you run "mount -a" after inserting the disk, does it appear?
2007-08-16T10:19:00.000Z	therealnanotube	PCboy123	and is it listed in the output of just plain "mount"
