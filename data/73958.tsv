2008-11-24T11:18:00.000Z	Peddy1		Does anyone know of a dock that doesn't require a compositor or 3d graphics?
2008-11-24T11:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Peddy1	There are composite managers that don't require 3D acceleration
2008-11-24T11:19:00.000Z	Peddy1	Jordan_U	Does the built-in Metacity compositor require 3D acceleration?
2008-11-24T11:21:00.000Z	Peddy1	Jordan_U	It doesn't. Thanks for your help
