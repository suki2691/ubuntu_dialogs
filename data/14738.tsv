2011-07-21T04:24:00.000Z	erika_	yagoo	yea it did. I got to install by removing the flash drive. At what point after loading the ubuntu minimal cd can you remove the flash media? After i got everything to install it gave me a black screen at boot
2011-07-21T04:25:00.000Z	yagoo	erika_	well i guess right when you go to the next boot menu.. (i would only unplug a usb when there's no activity.. don't unplug it while booting up-- eg: bios boot menu)
2011-07-21T04:26:00.000Z	erika_	yagoo	ok. i'm gonna try doing the installation again. this time i wont try setting up an encrypted lvm
