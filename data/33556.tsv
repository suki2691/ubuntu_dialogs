2011-01-28T11:27:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet		Hi all; I'm looking for a 27" LCD monitor (x3) w/out speakers! Do they make such a thing? (I've got the okay to replace this old computer and monitors with new goodies)
2011-01-28T11:28:00.000Z	yondering	NineTeen67Comet	I've got a 28" LCD, but I wouldn't recommend it for anything beyond normal gaming/desktop use.
2011-01-28T11:28:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet		Not necisarily related; I just trust the advice I get from fellow Bunter's ..
2011-01-28T11:28:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	yondering	I'm not a big gamer/movie watcher, but I do love my desktop space (currently have 2 19" HP monitors).
