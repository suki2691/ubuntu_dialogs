2008-11-24T18:50:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		Does installing from packages automatically do that? (I have no idea if "installing from packages" is a real term. I'm totally BSing my way through Linux terminology.)
2008-11-24T18:50:00.000Z	r3dux	Chaotic_Descent	- sounds like src - I've got mysql up and running without changing any dir permissions
2008-11-24T18:51:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	r3dux	ok, thanks. sounds like this whole LAMP setup tutorial is redundant... :(
