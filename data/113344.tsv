2008-07-07T01:41:00.000Z	Mirth321		Hey guys, I don't understand this: "What command would you use to create a sub-directory named mysub in your home directory? How would you specify (ie. write or refer to) an absolute path to this new directory (from the system root directory /) ?"
2008-07-07T01:42:00.000Z	Mirth321		I know to make the new directory is $ mkdir mysub
2008-07-07T01:42:00.000Z	Mirth321		But I don't understand the last part.
