2008-10-21T22:44:00.000Z	Helminthe	Mohammad[B]	hylafax is a very good software for this task, although you'll need to do some serious reading in its manual
2008-10-21T22:45:00.000Z	Mohammad[B]	Helminthe	that is cli based ?
2008-10-21T22:46:00.000Z	Helminthe	Mohammad[B]	it has all the options and GUI frontends you might need a few dozen more :)
