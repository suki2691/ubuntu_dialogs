2006-12-12T13:04:00.000Z	msun		 Help Request - I'm trying to install Ubuntu for the 1st time.  I have a Dell 1920x1200 widescreen LCD monitor.  When I boot the install CD, I get the screen with the little progress indicator for about 30 seconds, then the screen goes blank and my monitor says "Can not display this mode."   I reboot and try hitting F4 to change the resolution but it does not help.   What to do?!
