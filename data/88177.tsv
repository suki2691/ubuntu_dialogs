2008-06-09T23:32:00.000Z	Sanketsu		Anyone have any idea why my Ubuntu might not let me log in normally?  I've got to use Gnome failsafe to get in on 8.04 but everything is fine with 7.10.  I'm on an HP pavilion a1330n. I try to log in and the screen goes to the creme color I'm used to, it sits for a few seconds, then the lower quarter or so of the screen goes black and a second later it kicks back to the log in screen.

2008-06-09T23:34:00.000Z	Sanketsu	iateshaggy	I'm on Ubuntu right now, and using the same system, just in "failsafe GNOME" session so I don't think so, but I'll check out what ASULutzy said.
2008-06-09T23:50:00.000Z	Sanketsu	iateshaggy	I tried ctrl+alt+F1 at the log in screen after it kicked me back (I've got autologin enabled) and the screen wigged out like when I try to log in normally.
