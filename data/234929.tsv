2007-11-06T20:01:00.000Z	jeffrey		HELP!!! i cant boot into ubuntu anymore, i was orignally had no splash screen so i came in here looking for help to get it working someone told me to install start up manager and mess around with it.   i did exactly that installed and messed around with the resolution i believe now it wont boot anymore.  it just sits at a black screen i dont even hit the login screen.  The only way i can get in is to go to recovery console
2007-11-06T20:01:00.000Z	jeffrey		and then do the exit command and it boots up to the login screen
