2009-08-06T18:07:00.000Z	|]Spectre[|	Cyber_Akuma	no
2009-08-06T18:10:00.000Z	|]Spectre[|	Cyber_Akuma	the only reasonable way to increase a pc speed is to add more ram,or switch to a flash memory instead of an hard drive
2009-08-06T18:11:00.000Z	|]Spectre[|	Cyber_Akuma	but flash memory has a limitated number of  erase/write cycles
