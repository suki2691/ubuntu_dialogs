2008-03-20T04:36:00.000Z	dep	MUS4SHIII	Not possible. If you want a more detailed description of why, ask, but it's related to their gtk implementation
2008-03-20T04:39:00.000Z	dep	MUS4SHIII	Compiz's "Widget Layer" may be what you're looking for, it is a toggle-able widget display
2008-03-20T04:41:00.000Z	dep	MUS4SHIII	Good luck, personally I just wish they'd code the show desktop button so that it didn't screw up things so badly. Meh.
