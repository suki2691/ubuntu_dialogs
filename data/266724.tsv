2010-01-05T10:16:00.000Z	morpheus_		after starting mplayer, sound will not play in any program, player dont work. it's write "Error opening/initializating the selected video_out (-vo) device."
2010-01-05T10:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	morpheus_	 the defalt -vo 'device' may need to be changed.
2010-01-05T10:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	morpheus_	 but im not sure why that sould affect sound.. unless mplayer is some how crashing
2010-01-05T10:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	morpheus_	 try some different -vo outputs perhaps
