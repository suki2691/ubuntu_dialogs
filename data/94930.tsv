2012-10-19T10:38:00.000Z	Flynsarmy		hmmm. i'm attempting to back up my home dir to a NTFS drive but zip keeps failing with permission errors - probably because python, googlechrome, wine and a few other folders have symlinks that lead to /etc folders...how can I get around this?
2012-10-19T10:39:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	Flynsarmy	could try --symlinks (looked at the manpage, idk)
2012-10-19T10:39:00.000Z	D3RGPS31		i'm still without thumbnails :c now i have to read the file names
2012-10-19T10:40:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	D3RGPS31	thanks, will give it a shot
