Could I have caused that by multi-tasking while it was compiling?  (I quit stuff soon after compiler started but maybe not soon enough?) To fix it I can apt-get install on top of the original installation or do I have to uninstall first?

2005-03-03T16:44:00.000Z	helio7	jnk	I followed the directions http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=94 do you think i need to unintall the libs and the codecs or just the mplayer itself?
