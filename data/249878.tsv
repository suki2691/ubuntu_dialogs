2008-11-17T04:59:00.000Z	Peter_G		I'm new to Ubuntu (literally, I installed it for the first time this weekend), and have a quick question, if I may.  A guy I talk with who is a Linux guru said that it was possible to make the screen display "simulate" another size.  The actual screen resolution never changes, but it will display things like it is another size.  The computer I'm using has a 800X480 display.  I want to use an application that runs on a 1028X768 display.  Any ideas ho
2008-11-17T05:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Peter_G	 ages ago you could have a 'large' screen and  with a smaller monitor/display you would 'pan around' the  large screen as you moused around.. but that feature is  not used much any more.. its a bit of a bother with how window managers.panels and apps work these days
