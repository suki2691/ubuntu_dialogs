2007-04-20T08:00:00.000Z	seamus7		Hi... I'm currently at the 'fetching and installing' stage of the network upgrade to feisty... i have the alternate feisty CD that was being considered for release ... can I cancel the dist-upgrade over the network and just use the alt CD?
2007-04-20T08:00:00.000Z	Vuen_	seamus7	if the dist-upgrade is still in the download phase, then yes.
2007-04-20T08:01:00.000Z	Vuen_	seamus7	cancel it before you put the cd in the drive. it should autorun and offer to upgrade.
2007-04-20T08:02:00.000Z	seamus7	Vuen_	yeah i'm still just downloading at less than 30kb/s ... over 5 hours left ... i see there's an upgrade script on the cd ... can i cancel the dist-upgrade through an "End Process" via System Monitor or Force Quite?
