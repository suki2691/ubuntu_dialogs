2012-05-30T18:30:00.000Z	JonnyRo		Do I have to use Unity with Ubuntu 12.04, or can I switch after it is installed?
2012-05-30T18:31:00.000Z	reisio	JonnyRo	you can switch, but depending on what you want to switch to, it might make more sense to install from different media
2012-05-30T18:31:00.000Z	reisio	JonnyRo	mmm, will probably improve over time
2012-05-30T18:32:00.000Z	JonnyRo	reisio	i agree. I wonder if there is a way to prevent it from putting the unity dock on both screens
