2012-10-06T03:27:00.000Z	brightsparks		I have ubuntu 8.04 on a hard drive. I think it's file system 3?? I have the option to automatically update it but I'm puzzled how the file system will be affected? Don't I have to manually format the drive or something. So what happens if I automatically update to say 10.04?
2012-10-06T03:27:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	brightsparks	 8.04 server?
2012-10-06T03:28:00.000Z	brightsparks	MonkeyDust	server? no I don't think so
2012-10-06T03:29:00.000Z	brightsparks	MonkeyDust	did you mean I could use 8.04 as a server?
