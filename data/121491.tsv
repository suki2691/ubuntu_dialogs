2007-12-03T23:29:00.000Z	AskHL_		How much memory is trackerd supposed to consume? Because it is using more than 100 MB on my low-memory system, and the usage increases steadily
2007-12-03T23:29:00.000Z	usser	AskHL_	u can set the amount of memory dedicated to indexing
2007-12-03T23:35:00.000Z	AskHL_	usser	thank you. I looked through the administration -> services program, but I see no way to configure trackerd. I can see there is a low-mem mode in the man page, I just need to know, then, where I can change the parameters
2007-12-03T23:36:00.000Z	usser	AskHL_	its in system->preferences->indexing preferences
