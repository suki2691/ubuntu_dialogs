2008-04-18T18:28:00.000Z	pajamian	Vasa	what message is left when it tries?
2008-04-18T18:30:00.000Z	pajamian	Vasa	so what is the last message you see, then, before hitting the power off button?
2008-04-18T18:31:00.000Z	pajamian	Vasa	right, sorry, I was hoping it would have text there.  There is a way to disable the splash screen so it actualyl shows the text of what it is doing, but I don't know what it is off the top of my head.  Maybe someone else here will know?
