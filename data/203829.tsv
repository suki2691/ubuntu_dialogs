2009-06-24T17:28:00.000Z	bthour		I want to have three monitors in panarama and have two 9800GT cards and was wondering if it's possible to do so without nvidia sli?
2009-06-24T17:29:00.000Z	bthour		yeh but 9800GT only has two dvi
2009-06-24T17:30:00.000Z	denny	bthour	it's not possible since Ubuntu 8.04
2009-06-24T17:31:00.000Z	denny	bthour	anything using an older version of xorg (or possibly xfree86?) will work
