2012-11-13T00:51:00.000Z	episteme		morning everyone! quick vsftpd question (already tried in #vsftpd, but no response). I'm getting a critical error when trying to connect with a local_user. What causes this and how can i change it? This is a fresh install and the only changes i made to the .conf file are turning off anonymous and turning on local enable. TIA
