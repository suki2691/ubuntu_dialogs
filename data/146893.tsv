2007-03-31T06:01:00.000Z	Projectwhat		I tried to install beryl (http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/AiGLX) but all it does when i go to the beryl manager is logs me off and then askme to log in again. The screen alos flickers a couple of times. What is wrong and how should I fix it?
