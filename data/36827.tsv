2010-03-09T04:50:00.000Z	gilead		there's a heated discussion about 14-year old virgins over at #linux so I thought I'd bother you guys instead :)
2010-03-09T04:50:00.000Z	gilead		the question is: how can I change base mouse speed (not acceleration) in X.org? I tried to set Resolution and Sensitivity in the mouse section but it didn't change anything. Actually at the end I changed mouse driver to 'blahblah' and it still worked o_O so I'm not even sure the mouse section is the right place.
