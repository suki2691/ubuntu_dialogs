2009-04-01T07:18:00.000Z	Tophu		ok I had the nvidia 180.29 drivers installed from the website and I installed made the mistake of turning on the 177 drivers in the "hardware drivers" section no when I boot up "X" won't load :-( can anyone help me undo this?
2009-04-01T07:19:00.000Z	Tophu		I did ctrl+alt+f1 and did sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2009-04-01T07:21:00.000Z	Tophu		is there a way to undo the driver install from system > administration > hardware drivers (from the cmd line?)
