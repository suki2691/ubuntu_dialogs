2006-11-15T16:20:00.000Z	dennister	mcquaid	exactly...i386 is wonderful

2006-11-15T16:25:00.000Z	mcquaid	dennister	well my knowledge of 64bit arch is pretty limited, but one of the big benefits I believe is being able to address a lot more memory.  This has advantages for servers much more than for desktop users.  And that's great and all, but when your going to run into so many problems with various software, I'd personally just stick to 386 for the time being
