2010-05-01T04:54:00.000Z	daftykins	devin	the nvidia drivers just don't seem to set the TTYs and boot-up to the right resolution. it's a shame i know
2010-05-01T04:56:00.000Z	devin	daftykins	well is there a way to correct it? I'm not sure of what file to edit anymore since adding the correct vga parameters to kernel lines been depreciated and no longer seem to work
2010-05-01T04:57:00.000Z	daftykins	devin	no no idea myself, i'm still getting over the mass headache of nvidia+nouveau
