2007-11-26T20:22:00.000Z	jughead		I have a hardware issue that I don't think is related to Ubuntu (it happens in Windows also).  My computer monitor light will go into hibernate mode and the keyboard will stop working.  The computer/fans/everything in the case seems to be working.  Any ideas?

2007-11-26T20:25:00.000Z	jughead	Jack_Sparrow	is there a way to check my cpu temp via terminal?
