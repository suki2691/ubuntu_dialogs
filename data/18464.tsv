2011-08-26T10:21:00.000Z	BlackFlag		I have a notebook with video card from SIS, 771/671 PCIE VGA Display Adapter, with Ubuntu 11.04 with Gnome (Unity doesn't work here) and I need to reduce the brightness of the screen. I tried this prompt "setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=60", but doens't work; in power management have no slider to control it...
2011-08-26T10:22:00.000Z	ParkerR	BlackFlag	tried System > Preferences > Power management? Theres a brightness slider on that first page
2011-08-26T10:23:00.000Z	BlackFlag	ParkerR	the slider doesn't appear
2011-08-26T10:23:00.000Z	ParkerR	BlackFlag	hmm dunno then. Sorry.
