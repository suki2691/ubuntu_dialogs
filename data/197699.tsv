2010-08-26T15:10:00.000Z	fancybit		I see so many scripts in /etc/init & /etc/init.d  what sequence they'll exec at system startup?
2010-08-26T15:11:00.000Z	fancybit		you can search the airstrom
2010-08-26T15:11:00.000Z	ectospasm	fancybit	you'll need to look at all the links in /etc/rc?.d which will tell you the order they'll be run in.
