2007-08-25T16:40:00.000Z	ompaul	Xyhthyx	yeap but it would not be what you expect you will have no desktop at all
2007-08-25T16:41:00.000Z	Xyhthyx	ompaul	Ok I figured that would be the end result.
2007-08-25T16:44:00.000Z	ompaul	Xyhthyx	mdious please take that to pm and you can discover between you how to break your machine
