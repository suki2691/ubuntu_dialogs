2008-10-12T01:41:00.000Z	uncmar		Ubuntu 8.04 Live CD.  Pretty thing.  I will be interfacing with a Vista system tomorrow.
2008-10-12T01:42:00.000Z	uncmar		I would like to boot with the Ubuntu Live CD and do a dd of a FAT32 drive into a file on the Vista system.  Vista's NTFS.
2008-10-12T01:42:00.000Z	uncmar		Is that risky? should I be looking for a Windows solution for the dd?
