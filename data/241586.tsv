2005-07-02T09:40:00.000Z	tiredbones		I tried to use "apachectl start" for my newly apache2 system. apachectl can not be found. Does apache2 use something diffrenet?
2005-07-02T09:41:00.000Z	tritium	tiredbones	"sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start|stop|restart"
2005-07-02T09:41:00.000Z	tritium	tiredbones	but it should have started on install)
