2006-04-20T08:59:00.000Z	Xaero_Vincent		Ubuntu Dapper is under feature lock.. by the time its released in June, all its packages will be outdated... so is there going to be a big update by the time it's released?
2006-04-20T09:01:00.000Z	Hobbsee	Xaero_Vincent	they wont be that outdated.  ask in #ubuntu+1
2006-04-20T09:01:00.000Z	Xaero_Vincent	Hobbsee	some packages are already outdated.. im just looking on distrowatch :/
2006-04-20T09:01:00.000Z	Hobbsee	Xaero_Vincent	you find that on anything stable...
