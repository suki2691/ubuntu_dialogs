2009-07-04T08:26:00.000Z	gsr		I ran the "check hard drives" option on the ubuntu 9.04 live CD, and it reported there was an error (but didn't say what).  How can I run this check from the command line?  both fsck and e2fsck don't report any errors (but the install CD reports I/O errors when trying to install ubuntu).
2009-07-04T08:28:00.000Z	async	gsr	- sounds like you have erros
2009-07-04T08:28:00.000Z	async	gsr	- sounds like you have errors on the CD itself. Maybe a burn error or something
2009-07-04T08:29:00.000Z	gsr	async	hmm, ok.  ill reburn it and try again.  Maybe tomorrow, I've been fighting with grub for the last 4 hours
