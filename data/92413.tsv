2008-05-02T21:06:00.000Z	UnityDivide	ph8	I do you have the compiz settings manager installed?
2008-05-02T21:06:00.000Z	ph8	UnityDivide	Yup! i can configure the spinning cube and things!
2008-05-02T21:07:00.000Z	UnityDivide	ph8	there should be an option in there somewhere to disable the roll-up effect
