2008-11-10T08:15:00.000Z	_hase		I am  wondering if anyone here would be able to help me get the drivers for my video card installed, I've been researching on the ubuntu forums and it looks like for the card I have, [ProSavage8 KM266/KL266] there is a way to get direct rendering but all of the packages the tutorials say to download seem to be missing from synaptic
