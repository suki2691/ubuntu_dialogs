2009-03-03T05:37:00.000Z	filthpig		hi all. I installed an Ubuntu derivative called easypeasy, which is built upon Intrepid, on a netbook (Acer Aspire One 110) and while in the live environment the wlan card worked, but after install it just didn't. I don't know if this is an issue with Ubuntu 8.10, can somebody confirm if it is?

2009-03-03T05:39:00.000Z	filthpig	sebsebseb	no not right now. I'm on my normal laptop now.
