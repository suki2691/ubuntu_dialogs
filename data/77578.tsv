2009-05-22T07:21:00.000Z	Stargazer		Hey guys, i need a way to backup my entire Ubuntu system so i can just double-click and re-install it all. any suggestions ?
2009-05-22T07:23:00.000Z	Stargazer		Th0r, i kinda like that idea... but instead of just packages how about my entire system onto DVDs or something ?
2009-05-22T07:25:00.000Z	Stargazer		Has anyone successfully used 'backuppc' ?
