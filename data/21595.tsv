2011-10-22T07:45:00.000Z	rickbee		Hello! I can't seem to get flash to install on any browsers, including chrome which 'includes' it... any ideas?
2011-10-22T07:46:00.000Z	dc5ala	rickbee	you mean manual installation?
2011-10-22T07:47:00.000Z	rickbee	dc5ala	yes, I tried installing flashplayer non-free
2011-10-22T07:49:00.000Z	dc5ala	rickbee	have you used the package flashplugin-installer? Or on a 64 bit system adobe-flashplugin?
