2011-09-08T03:52:00.000Z	jeeves_moss	zykotick9	thanks.  I think it's for another OS control, it's for the RadiusManager package.
2011-09-08T03:53:00.000Z	zykotick9	jeeves_moss	do you know what startos is?  I've never heard of it, but it "appears" that perhaps where it's from
2011-09-08T03:53:00.000Z	jeeves_moss	zykotick9	no idea.  as I said, it's a built in thing for RadiusManager
