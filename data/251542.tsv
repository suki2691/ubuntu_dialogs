2007-04-13T06:08:00.000Z	billy		how large should I make my / partition?
2007-04-13T06:09:00.000Z	cafuego	billy	That depends. if you split /usr and /home, a few hundred MB will do. If you split off /home, 2GB minimum, 4GB would be ideal.

2007-04-13T06:11:00.000Z	billy	cafuego	I set it to 4GiB, with 5% reserved.  Just trying to pin down what's breaking my installation process.
