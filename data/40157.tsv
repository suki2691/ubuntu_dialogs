2009-12-25T10:29:00.000Z	Real_Christmas	KB1JWQ	Well, I will try to let ordinary people pay for the service. It's a way to block bad internet use by passing their traffic through my servers.
2009-12-25T10:30:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	Real_Christmas	You're a service provider?!
2009-12-25T10:31:00.000Z	Real_Christmas	KB1JWQ	No, not a service provider, but I'm planning to be like a filtering ISP, using proxy servers to filter their traffic from unwanted material.
