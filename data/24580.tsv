2011-06-11T20:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	Emmanuel_Chanel	 you just dont hear much about any of the ReiserFS's  these days. BTRFS is the next big thing i guess.
2011-06-11T20:09:00.000Z	Emmanuel_Chanel	dr_willis	Thx answering.
2011-06-11T20:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	Emmanuel_Chanel	 i did see where the next fedora may default to btrfs. so that is looking like the future. Theres been talk of ubuntu doing the same. but personally for my needs. I dont think it matters.
