2008-03-20T22:55:00.000Z	hischild	wubrgame1	if you're on a dhcp enabled network, sudo dhclient should bring up the default interface
2008-03-20T22:57:00.000Z	hischild	wubrgame1	i gave you an answer
2008-03-20T22:58:00.000Z	hischild	wubrgame1	i shall say this again to you: If you are on a wired network that does have dhcp, you can type "sudo dhclient" and it will bring up your network interface.
