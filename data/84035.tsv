2008-09-04T19:59:00.000Z	Pici	qmemo	No, that is just a text-mode installer for the Desktop version.
2008-09-04T19:59:00.000Z	qmemo	Pici	so the Server edition do not have an alternate one
2008-09-04T20:00:00.000Z	Pici	qmemo	No, the server installer is similar to the alternate installer, no need for an alternate server install CD.
