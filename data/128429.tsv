2008-03-09T00:41:00.000Z	DJDarkstar		having an issue getting dvd playback to work, it downloaded the codecs and plugin's but totem doesn't want to play ... i get this : Totem cannot play this type of media (DVD) because it does not have the appropriate plugins to be able to read from the disc.
2008-03-09T00:42:00.000Z	DJDarkstar		am i missing something?
