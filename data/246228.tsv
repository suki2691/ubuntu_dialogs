2007-08-08T09:21:00.000Z	linux__alien		is it possible for me to contribute to ubuntu ? How do i contribute? I ve done very few in Fedora like documentation, Bug reporting but couldnt really test big things in Fedora because of the huge size of distro coz i couldnt afford to download it but in ubuntu its pretty small so how do i start ?
