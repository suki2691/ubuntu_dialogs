2006-11-27T14:26:00.000Z	Firefishe		I'm trying to install all of kde using 'apt-get install kde*' as root.  I receive the following error: http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/K2pUJx75.html

2006-11-27T14:32:00.000Z	Firefishe	fyrestrtr	 well, here's the rub:  I could do that, but since I already have all the .deb files cached, all it does is install kubuntu-desktop, kdm, and kubuntu-default-desktop or something like that.  The dependency problems remain.
