2007-04-30T07:53:00.000Z	Patrick_	KillerDemon	actually correct drivers = which ever makes the thing work as it should
2007-04-30T07:54:00.000Z	KillerDemon	Patrick_	but for propriety drivers it's a different case
2007-04-30T07:55:00.000Z	Patrick_	KillerDemon	yeah, well it is about time that proprietry or opensource drivers function properly instead of sacrificing performance
