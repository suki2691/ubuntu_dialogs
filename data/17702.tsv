2011-03-05T05:41:00.000Z	Jasonn	Djpenguin	yeah, but why install that when you can get the real thing?
2011-03-05T05:43:00.000Z	Djpenguin	Jasonn	 You were looking to get off of mac, no? You'd install that because you have the functionality of linux with a pretty interface that would be more familiar to an ex-mac user
2011-03-05T05:44:00.000Z	Jasonn	Djpenguin	HAHA, why would i get a mac? I was actually suggesting ubuntu to an ex-mac user, but i really wouldnt mind the interface change as the mac interface is horrd anyways
