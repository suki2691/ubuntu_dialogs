2012-08-30T02:45:00.000Z	lsv	k3rn3l_klink	maybe wait?
2012-08-30T02:46:00.000Z	k3rn3l_klink	lsv	not sure I understand your "question".
2012-08-30T02:48:00.000Z	lsv	k3rn3l_klink	after upgrade, normal boot makes my display stay blank/black.  I can get a low resolution display after selecting recovery mode from grub menu.
