2010-11-25T22:00:00.000Z	evilbug	eZet	yeah. the issue is i'm doing this remotely and he doesn't know what i'm talking about :( i'll try. seems like a bios issue.
2010-11-25T22:00:00.000Z	eZet	evilbug	Most likely F8, F10 or F12. If there's no such option, you'll have to enter the bios and prioritize booting from dvd over hdd.
