2011-12-04T04:23:00.000Z	maestrojed		I have a 2nd harddrive that does not mount until you access it via "Places" or something similar. I want it to mount automatically. Someone told me to look at /etc/fstab but I need help. I see two drives listed in fstab, and ext4 and a swap. I am not sure if either of these are the 2nd HD I am concerned about.
2011-12-04T04:24:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	maestrojed	 are you familiar with adding entries in fstab?
2011-12-04T04:24:00.000Z	maestrojed		Is it possible my 2nd hard drive is not in fstab at all?
2011-12-04T04:24:00.000Z	maestrojed	MonkeyDust	no, I have looked at it before, but no, I don't really know what I am doing
