2009-01-23T22:29:00.000Z	InvaderZim	onetinsoldier	 i don't know.  i logged on today, and the resolution was off.  everything bigger than normal.  so i went to settings manager, then display.  my resolution was set to something other than the recommended one.  the recommended value was not in the list.
