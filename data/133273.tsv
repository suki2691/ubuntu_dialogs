2009-05-16T12:05:00.000Z	Madsy		Why does the Seamonkey-gui allow me to sign my own personal key(s)? Is it a bug, or is there some kind of purpose with this I don't grasp?

2009-05-16T12:06:00.000Z	Amaranth	Madsy	Because your old key was trusted at some level so you signing your new key transfers that trust
2009-05-16T12:06:00.000Z	Madsy	Amaranth	I see. Thanks.
