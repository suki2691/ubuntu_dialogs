2012-08-07T12:28:00.000Z	TJ-	djdexter	'--password=$somepasswordStartingWithDolar'
2012-08-07T12:28:00.000Z	TJ-	djdexter	 or even --password='$somepasswordStartingWithDolar'
2012-08-07T12:28:00.000Z	TJ-	djdexter	in other words, surround the password with single quote marks so the shell doesn't interpret the $ symbol as a variable prefix
