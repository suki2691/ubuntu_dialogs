2007-05-26T16:50:00.000Z	macogw	CuriosCat	do you have edgy set to get the "proposed" updates?  if not, enable them and update.  gnupg had a problem that made errors going edgy > feisty
2007-05-26T16:50:00.000Z	CuriosCat	macogw	How do I check that setting? And this is a clean install, not an upgrade
2007-05-26T16:50:00.000Z	macogw	CuriosCat	oh nevermind then
