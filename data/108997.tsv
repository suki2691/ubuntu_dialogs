2008-01-22T00:51:00.000Z	daxroc	x-X-x	check out nvclock , not recomended. Why do you want to overclock ?
2008-01-22T00:52:00.000Z	x-X-x	daxroc	my fsb can handle alot more and temperature is not a problem for me. is nvclock the only option?
2008-01-22T00:52:00.000Z	daxroc	x-X-x	coolbits and nvclock are the only options afaik
2008-01-22T00:55:00.000Z	daxroc	x-X-x	nvclock worked for me ( under a diffrent distro ) will revert on reboot iirc
