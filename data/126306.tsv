2007-08-19T06:41:00.000Z	Meroigo-laptop		That's pretty stupid if I had uplated it that needed reboot, and want to controll it again :/ then i must insert a keyboard and screen (if i want to see what im typing) int he server.
2007-08-19T06:42:00.000Z	Meroigo-laptop		can you make Remote Desktop be enabled when no one has logged in?
2007-08-19T06:42:00.000Z	Geek_	Meroigo-laptop	thats the nature of VNC. i'd suggest SSH(cli) or FreeNX (graphical) to fo it
