2006-10-02T09:09:00.000Z	Normal		Hey all.My new computer has two 250Gb Hard drives and 2GbRAM. Any advice on how to partition it? I just read something that said '/ 12gigs','swap 2gigs','/var 2gigs',/home for the rest. Is this good advice?
2006-10-02T09:11:00.000Z	Normal		Well, I know little, but I didn't have a hard time partitioning on my first bout with Ubuntu
2006-10-02T09:12:00.000Z	Normal		Okay, simple enough! How about this: 32 or 64bit? I have both installers and don't know which to use...
