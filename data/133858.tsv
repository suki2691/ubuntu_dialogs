2007-05-23T06:45:00.000Z	CoolThreads		Anyone play games on ubuntu? like neverwinter nights? just wondering... lets say I am playing and I want to switch back to the desktop quickly. Does anyone know how I can do this without saving and ending the game?
2007-05-23T06:45:00.000Z	CoolThreads		okay thanks will give it a go
