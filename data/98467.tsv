2008-03-08T11:45:00.000Z	sap1		Hi, Just wanted to know if there is a "post-it" or "sticky notes"  type program for ubuntu/linux  ?
2008-03-08T11:45:00.000Z	Dangermike	sap1	have you checked out tomboy notes
2008-03-08T11:46:00.000Z	Dangermike	sap1	you'll probably need to try a few out to see which works best for your needs
2008-03-08T11:47:00.000Z	Dangermike	sap1	tomboy should already be installed
