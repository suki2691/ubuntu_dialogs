2006-12-18T06:57:00.000Z	Pichu0102		How can I make it do commands upon joining a channel?
2006-12-18T06:58:00.000Z	FirstStrike	Pichu0102	a channel or a server?
2006-12-18T06:58:00.000Z	FirstStrike	Pichu0102	as far as i know, if you want it to perform anything on joining a channel you'll need a separate script for it.
