2012-01-11T02:36:00.000Z	John-_		On WINDOWS it's really easy to set permissions, there must be an easy way on Ubuntu to make it so only one user can access a file at a given time.
2012-01-11T02:37:00.000Z	John-_		It needs to be set so if file open, deny access to other users
2012-01-11T02:37:00.000Z	John-_		Yet have the other users access to roam on the server
