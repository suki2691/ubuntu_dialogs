2009-05-11T07:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nJustin3k	yes, but it would take some fiddling with /etc/fstab
2009-05-11T07:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nJustin3k	look in your fstab and you will see   UUID=c4a69a44-f310-4e3b-afa3-354f61bef075 none            swap    sw              0       0
2009-05-11T07:58:00.000Z	nJustin3k	Jack_Sparrow	ok, thanks
