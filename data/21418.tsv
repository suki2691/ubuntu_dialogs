2012-06-21T16:45:00.000Z	vampirnata		but besides that, i'm still getting 4.0 average load on this dual atom with only samba taking 40% and the rest not much at all.
2012-06-21T16:46:00.000Z	vampirnata		I believe all atoms are dual no?
2012-06-21T16:47:00.000Z	compdoc	vampirnata	its more to do with the cpu type
