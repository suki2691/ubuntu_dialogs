2008-01-01T23:00:00.000Z	Amerio		ok back
2008-01-01T23:01:00.000Z	Amerio		does anybody know why I get a black screen instead of Ubuntu Loading progress bar before the login screen?
2008-01-01T23:02:00.000Z	FrostRat	Amerio	I get the black screen, too... after upgrading to Gutsy.  You can fix it by modifying the resolution by hand, from what I've read
2008-01-01T23:02:00.000Z	FrostRat	Amerio	haven't tried it myself yet, though... I don't mind the black screen. :D  I only reboot once a month or so.
