2006-11-04T08:45:00.000Z	GaiaX11	mzli	why linux developers do not find a way to face this ntfs writing problem. It is really annoying to see the message even as root not been able to change files in ntfs.

2006-11-04T08:50:00.000Z	GaiaX11	mzli	But this is the feeling. How on earth cannot root deal with it! Just a bad feeling :-(
