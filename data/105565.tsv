2008-01-17T04:52:00.000Z	magnetron	pornsakb	you could install xubuntu oro ubuntu minimal, they are slimmed down
2008-01-17T04:54:00.000Z	magnetron	pornsakb	NP. keep in mind that the minimal version has no graphical interface - it's THAT slimmed down
2008-01-17T04:58:00.000Z	pornsakb	magnetron	that's fine, it's intended for specific application anyway
