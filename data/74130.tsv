2008-12-10T15:32:00.000Z	Tch23		Hi again!
2008-12-10T15:34:00.000Z	Tch23		I got two sound cards (internal and USB). I got the USB as default and I got sound... But the sound level is mad! I can't set it, cause it goes up n down. The left becomes independant of the right... I'm puzzled

2008-12-10T15:35:00.000Z	Tch23	hischild	yeah but it can only be a temporary solution
