2007-04-09T10:19:00.000Z	roadfish		do other people get "no installation candidate" if they attempt "apt-get install dict-wn"?
2007-04-09T10:19:00.000Z	ikonia	roadfish	the package doesn't exist
2007-04-09T10:21:00.000Z	roadfish	ikonia	why would dictd recommend dict-wn if it doesn't exist? I'm new to Ubuntu but had been using dict-wn in the past (on a Knoppix harddrive install).
2007-04-09T10:21:00.000Z	ikonia	roadfish	perhaps the package is not finished
