2011-07-16T15:36:00.000Z	astraljava	soulis77-SE	Absolutely. That would be a seriously lousy server component if it didn't allow opening some ports. :)
2011-07-16T15:38:00.000Z	astraljava	soulis77-SE	Yes, that is the standard way of writing instructions. If you're doing something remotely, it is generally expected that you have some experience and understanding how that differs from the basic scenario.
