2011-06-02T02:44:00.000Z	pcpower		grub2 is default? then why do I have 0.97 in 10.10...
2011-06-02T02:46:00.000Z	pcpower		and it says legacy uses menu.lst and not grub.cfg when I have grub.cfg, yet it says 0.97
2011-06-02T02:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pcpower	did you upgrade?  I believe that gives different grub then a fresh install.
