2007-09-15T11:35:00.000Z	Absenth	Empath	I've used WoW on .9.4.0 iirc.  worked just fine.
2007-09-15T11:35:00.000Z	Absenth	Empath	ahh, that I can't answer.  don't have WoW or the Restricted drivers on this notebook.
2007-09-15T11:36:00.000Z	Absenth	Empath	and I don't think testing via vpn/remote x to home is a good option :)
