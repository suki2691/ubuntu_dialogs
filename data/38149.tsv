2010-08-02T13:24:00.000Z	fabio__	NitzchONot	can it be something with the player's configuration ?
2010-08-02T13:25:00.000Z	fabio__		hi :D
2010-08-02T13:25:00.000Z	NitzchONot	fabio__	this happens with ALL the players. Totem, Rhythmbox, Exail. I dont think thats a players issue (Also, i use Lucid Lynx)
