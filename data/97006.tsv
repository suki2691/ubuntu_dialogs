There are linux driver issues with many wifi cards these days.  https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/32516  The cost of a wifi device may be much less than the effort required to enable and maintain a difficult to support wifi device with non-free ndiswrapper drivers.   They are less than $20 these days, some less than $10 at Fry's Electronics.
