2007-05-26T10:22:00.000Z	iehova		Hi... When I try to format my external hard drive on ubuntu 7.04 to fat32 or NFTS (my friend needs to borrow it) the current partition is deleted fine, but the disk always re-mounts automatically and then won't format to anything. When I unmount it, it goes back to being ext3 with the same files on as before.
2007-05-26T10:22:00.000Z	iehova		Can anyone help?
2007-05-26T10:23:00.000Z	non|linear	iehova	what are you using to format
2007-05-26T10:23:00.000Z	non|linear	iehova	are you sure it supports vfat/ntfs
