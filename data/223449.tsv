2006-12-24T13:28:00.000Z	No1Viking		I have problems getting my PC, with Kubuntu, connected to my Wireless LAN. I know that it works without problems in Gnome. When trying to set WEP key and Hex it seems it does not save the data and I can't connect. Anywhere else I can put that data so it's permanent, and working, in the system?

2006-12-24T13:29:00.000Z	No1Viking	nn	ok... will check that one
