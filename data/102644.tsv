2008-12-01T21:06:00.000Z	trym_work		Does anyone know of a lightweight utility with command line options to display simple html pages? preferably something thats included in ubuntu by default
2008-12-01T21:08:00.000Z	trym_work		Rabbitbunny/paddy: sorry I was a bit unclear. I want command line options, but I dont want the util to be command line. It needs to display images etc
2008-12-01T21:09:00.000Z	rww	trym_work	if you want GUI apps, look at Epiphany or Dillo (I assume you already ruled out Fx)
2008-12-01T21:09:00.000Z	rww	trym_work	but I hear links2 can display graphics anyway =/
