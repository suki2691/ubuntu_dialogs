2010-11-27T01:55:00.000Z	LadySm0ke		can someone help me with this boot up problem? Ubuntu 10.04 installed from wubi, reboots when I select Ubuntu on startup - tried fixing GRUB but doesn't work for some reason, error messages everywhere
2010-11-27T01:56:00.000Z	LadySm0ke		yes Muimi
2010-11-27T01:57:00.000Z	LadySm0ke		that's why I tried reinstalling grub, but no matter what i do, after mounting a directory it doesn't let me touch anything else
2010-11-27T01:58:00.000Z	idletask	LadySm0ke	"after mounting a directory"? Care to elaborate?
