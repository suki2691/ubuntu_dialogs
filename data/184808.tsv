2007-12-04T12:18:00.000Z	Mashi		Hi, I'm running Ubuntu on a laptop -- how do I remove all sounds? I have removed them from System -> Preference -> Sound but it still plays a little "drum solo" at the login screen
2007-12-04T12:19:00.000Z	Schalken	Mashi	oh, thats part of the login screen ("GDM") theme. you'll have to edit the GDM theme to get rid of it I think.
2007-12-04T12:20:00.000Z	Schalken	Mashi	actually, have a look in system > admin > login screen (or something like that)
2007-12-04T12:20:00.000Z	Schalken	Mashi	there might be something in there about the login screen sounds
