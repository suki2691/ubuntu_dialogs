2007-04-19T16:48:00.000Z	twobrandys		I have IBM lenovo R60e - would Ubuntu or Kubuntu run and look better on there?
2007-04-19T16:49:00.000Z	Madpilot	twobrandys	Ubuntu will always look better - but then, I might just be a Gnome fancreature.
2007-04-19T16:50:00.000Z	twobrandys	Madpilot	hello gnomefancreature ^^ and performance/functional wise they are the same?
2007-04-19T16:51:00.000Z	Madpilot	twobrandys	pretty much. Assuming you've got a modern(ish) machine with a decent amount of RAM, either will run fine. Kubuntu/KDE might be a bit heavier on RAM usage, that's all.
