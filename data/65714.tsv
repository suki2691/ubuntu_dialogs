2010-08-05T07:08:00.000Z	n-iCe		hi I did a clean ubuntu 10.04 install, but the clock is one hour delayed, any suggestions? I already set it, and changes in every boot.

2010-08-05T07:10:00.000Z	Tecna	n-iCe	I suggest checking your location in the clock settings.   also check daylight savings options.
