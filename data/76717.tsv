2008-10-24T05:52:00.000Z	Bashew_		Sorry about that, but I've got an issue with the 8.10 Beta, as well as all of the 8.10 Alphas
2008-10-24T05:53:00.000Z	Bashew_		So, would this be the room to talk about an issue with Ubuntu 8.10? Or could someone point me in the right direction... I'm sorry, but I'm stuck on irssi for the time being, and /list shows tooooo many channels for me to hunt down.
2008-10-24T05:53:00.000Z	Bashew_		At least with the Beta
2008-10-24T05:54:00.000Z	Vantrax	Bashew_	try ubuntu-1
