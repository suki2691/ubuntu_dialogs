2007-04-22T15:45:00.000Z	briank		Hi, I just ran the fedora core 6 live cd, and now after testing it, I want to reboot into my normal ubuntu grub menu, but it says insert system disk, any ideas on how to get things back to normal?!?

2007-04-22T15:47:00.000Z	soundray		!grub > briank, read ubotu's private message
