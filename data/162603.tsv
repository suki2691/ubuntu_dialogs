2007-04-13T12:52:00.000Z	PriceChild	Zaggynl^Laptop	you can't "just" pull it out in windows either... you should use "safely remove"
2007-04-13T12:52:00.000Z	PriceChild	Zaggynl^Laptop	Ubuntu also doesn't write to disk immediately, it caches it to help preserve life of your usb stic
2007-04-13T12:53:00.000Z	PriceChild	Zaggynl^Laptop	so if you don't install it safely you may lose data
