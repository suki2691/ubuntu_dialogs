2010-10-10T20:28:00.000Z	meerkater		hey all, i installed ubuntu 10.10 without any problems, very nice, thank you, however: I changed the button layout in the titlebar using the corresponding key via gconf-editor, however, metacity ignores my new settings - so how can i change the layout?

2010-10-10T20:30:00.000Z	meerkater		and i think i didn't do anything diffrent by firing up gconf-editor, did i?
