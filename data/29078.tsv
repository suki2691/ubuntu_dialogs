2011-01-19T23:38:00.000Z	R33D3M33R		hi all, can somebody recommend me a daily 11.04 build that 100% works?
2011-01-19T23:39:00.000Z	IdleOne	R33D3M33R	the answer is no, natty is alpha.
2011-01-19T23:39:00.000Z	R33D3M33R	IdleOne	but there must be a daily build that at least boots :)
2011-01-19T23:39:00.000Z	IdleOne	R33D3M33R	you would think so
