2008-05-26T16:42:00.000Z	hockeypuck89		ok, i just install ubuntu server on an old desktop in my closet, i have ssh and samba working and im looking to get ampache working...
2008-05-26T16:43:00.000Z	hockeypuck89		can anyone help with the commands to create directories for samba to share and ampache to pull music from? and how do i create users in samba so i can access those shares and get music in there... i also need to get the ampache config file into its place
