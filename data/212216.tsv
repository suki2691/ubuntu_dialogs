2007-03-19T06:18:00.000Z	robbie_crash		I've been on IRC for 12 years, and I can't recall being in any sort of support channel and having there be no bot. Most of the ubuto links carry the answers people are looking for, but aren't a hand hold through the entire process of setting up whatever it is people are looking to fix
2007-03-19T06:18:00.000Z	robbie_crash		But if someone had to retype the answers to the same questions 20 times a day they'd go mental
2007-03-19T06:19:00.000Z	robbie_crash		things like installing nvidia drivers comes up every 15 minutes in here, nobody would get any help if the helpers were constantly telling people how to install those drivers
2007-03-19T06:20:00.000Z	carpediem	robbie_crash	There was no bot on #gentoo when I was a regular there, and people got better answers as a result, imho.
