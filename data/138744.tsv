2008-09-15T04:26:00.000Z	DjDoUblEs		hello all, I have a bit of a Windows issue I need to ask about, but it arose while downloading ubuntu.
2008-09-15T04:27:00.000Z	DjDoUblEs		Anything I download that is more than 10 MB ends up incorrectly downloading or just corrupt.
2008-09-15T04:28:00.000Z	DjDoUblEs		I tried downloading ubuntu 8 times already, 4 times just from mirrors, twice for the torrent, and twice through wubi but to no avail.
