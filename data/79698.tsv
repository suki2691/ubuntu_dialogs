2008-09-13T21:01:00.000Z	Slart	SzalonyMjut	sudo dpkg -i <name of the deb file>
2008-09-13T21:02:00.000Z	SzalonyMjut	Slart	but after that ubuntu should can update that package if in repository will be newer ver. ?
2008-09-13T21:03:00.000Z	Slart	SzalonyMjut	I'm not entirely sure about what it will do.. I would guess it would update if there was a newer version in the repos.. but I'm not sure
