2008-01-09T13:11:00.000Z	ObeyRoy		Okay, i pasted it into the shell, but now i can't enter my password
2008-01-09T13:11:00.000Z	ObeyRoy		it asks for the password, but when i type anything in, it doesn't register
2008-01-09T13:11:00.000Z	cwillu	ObeyRoy	can't enter it, or it just doesn't echo what you type?  (password prompt won't show anything at all as you type)
