2008-04-25T00:50:00.000Z	Wyleyrabbit		I'm trying to burn the 8.04 cd using the built-in CD burner (whatever is installed by default) in Ubuntu 7.10. I have now made 4 coasters in a row. WTF??? Am I missing something? The software seems to have zero options to tweak, other than recording speed and I've tried everything from 16x down to 2x with the same result. What should I be using?

2008-04-25T00:51:00.000Z	J_Humphrey	Wyleyrabbit	Right click the iso file, and write to disc
2008-04-25T00:51:00.000Z	Wyleyrabbit	J_Humphrey	I have just been right-clicking the iso and choosing "write to disc"
