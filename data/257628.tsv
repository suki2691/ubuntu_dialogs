2007-04-20T13:41:00.000Z	chr_		anyone have experience with fdisk on linux? I am trying to "shrink" a partition but im not sure what how to do it. I just ran ntfsresize and I get this msg: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16508/
2007-04-20T13:42:00.000Z	Amaranth	chr_	I'd use partman
2007-04-20T13:44:00.000Z	Amaranth	chr_	partman or gparted
2007-04-20T13:44:00.000Z	Amaranth	chr_	fdisk is _not_ what you want
