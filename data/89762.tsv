2008-07-03T21:25:00.000Z	Pici	metalpres	Because Ubuntu is not a rolling release.  When a version is released, the package versions generally stay at what they were released as.
2008-07-03T21:26:00.000Z	metalpres	Pici	so there likely wont be and update to the nvidia drivers until 8.10?
2008-07-03T21:26:00.000Z	Pici	metalpres	Correct.
