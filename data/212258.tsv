2006-01-10T13:40:00.000Z	C-O-L-T		I have a question
2006-01-10T13:41:00.000Z	C-O-L-T		do you think fedora core is better than ubuntu?
2006-01-10T13:41:00.000Z	afief	C-O-L-T	used to be Fedora, it's a nice package, but i think ubuntu is better for the desktop
2006-01-10T13:49:00.000Z	afief	C-O-L-T	most of the software on the Fedora CDs are out of date anyway, if you update you won't be able to install most of it
