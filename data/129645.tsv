2007-06-27T05:45:00.000Z	ansimation		in 5.*installation it asked me for a root password. now I just installed 6.06 because I don't have the feisty fawn cd's yet and and it didn't even ask me to set one
2007-06-27T05:45:00.000Z	ub12	ansimation	try "sudo passwd root" and set the root password
2007-06-27T05:47:00.000Z	ansimation	ub12	that worked. thanks man, appreciate it.
2007-06-27T05:47:00.000Z	ub12	ansimation	no problem
