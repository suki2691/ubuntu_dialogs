2008-02-28T04:01:00.000Z	wib		hi. can you change ubuntu's account management behavior to normal *nix-style, like having one real root account and several user accounts?
2008-02-28T04:01:00.000Z	ffm	wib	it already is.
2008-02-28T04:02:00.000Z	ffm	wib	just "sudo passwd" and remove the "sudo" package.
2008-02-28T04:02:00.000Z	wib	ffm	ah hmm.
