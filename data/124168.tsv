2008-04-26T10:20:00.000Z	orudie_		i currently have ubuntu 7.10 server installed.. how can i update it to the new version? and if i do , will it keep all my settings and installed programs unchanged ?
2008-04-26T10:21:00.000Z	Vlet	orudie_	baaad idea. Servers are supposed to be STABLE. upgrading to a distro the day it was released is begging for instability
2008-04-26T10:23:00.000Z	orudie_	Vlet	so are you saying i shouldn't update ?
2008-04-26T10:24:00.000Z	Vlet	orudie_	well, you can try, but if your server is a live system (actively serving a purpose) then you should wait, and perhaps install HH server on a test system
