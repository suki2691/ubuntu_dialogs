2005-06-29T09:14:00.000Z	bob2	JuNkPhreak	that's highly unlikely to be a "64bit linux distro" problem
2005-06-29T09:18:00.000Z	JuNkPhreak	bob2	: been all over the net about issues with installing and running 32bit games with 64bit OS linux
2005-06-29T09:18:00.000Z	bob2	JuNkPhreak	yes, of course, you can't easily run mac games on an atari, either
