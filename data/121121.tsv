2007-10-30T00:56:00.000Z	Makedonas		quick question, have been looking around for a hassle free client that I can dual boot with vista, something with decent out of the box hardware support that isn't too intimidating for someone new to linux, am I right in thinking that ubuntu would be a good choice?

2007-10-30T00:58:00.000Z	xargon	Makedonas	yeah
