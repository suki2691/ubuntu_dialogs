2009-05-20T18:10:00.000Z	cougar10		hi, my X (gnome and xfce) refuses to start up (login goes away and I'm left on a blank screen + cursor). What to do?
2009-05-20T18:10:00.000Z	cougar10		(login goes away when I entered everything and pressed enter)
2009-05-20T18:11:00.000Z	cougar10		I'm now in "secure/rescue mode" or whatever it is called, jag_
