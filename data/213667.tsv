2006-05-27T07:12:00.000Z	HIHello		HI when I click my mouse scroll button to go down the page it goes back a page???
2006-05-27T07:12:00.000Z	HIHello		How do I reconfigure?
2006-05-27T07:13:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	HIHello	I'm not sure if there's an easy way, but you can look into modifying your xorg.conf...
2006-05-27T07:15:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	HIHello	Manually tweaking a text configuration file.  (I hate to say it but I recommend this be a look-around-and-read moment, b/c you'll get more out of it that way.)  In short, you'll be finding the mouse section, then the line for that button, and describing the behaviour it should have.
