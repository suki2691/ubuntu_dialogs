2005-09-08T12:10:00.000Z	Fikrann	erik	you need to edit your xorg.conf, font directories has been moved around.
2005-09-08T12:11:00.000Z	erik	Fikrann	you know how exactly I need to tweak it (or a doc or something)?
2005-09-08T12:13:00.000Z	Fikrann	erik	Nope, I forgot where they were moved (been several weeks since I last attempted to install Breezy) and the solution was trivial enough for me to find that I didn't memorize any details.
