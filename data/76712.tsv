2009-06-12T05:44:00.000Z	theman1		Hey, does anyone know how i can decrypt a string, that is encoded with rc4 (or ssl? base 64) that is salted with a pass? Thanks
2009-06-12T05:44:00.000Z	halberd	theman1	you mean if you don't know the pass?
2009-06-12T05:44:00.000Z	theman1	halberd	i do know the pass
2009-06-12T05:45:00.000Z	theman1	halberd	i suppose if i didnt it would be nearly impossible, well i could bruteforce somehow but thats not the case
