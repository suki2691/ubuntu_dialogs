2009-01-16T06:21:00.000Z	neurotope		installing ubuntu for the first time, will 64bit be harder to learn than 32bit?
2009-01-16T06:23:00.000Z	BCampbell	neurotope	 I see no difference in 32 versus 64 in learning
2009-01-16T06:23:00.000Z	neurotope	BCampbell	so the 64bit has similar driver / software support?
2009-01-16T06:24:00.000Z	BCampbell	neurotope	 as far as I can see yes.  I just installed Mythbunutu64 today and everything is running fine. All hardware is working and after running apt-get to install the gnome desktop everything is great.
