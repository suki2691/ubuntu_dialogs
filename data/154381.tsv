2009-08-31T00:34:00.000Z	edlik		please help me. my DHCP connection keeps flashing and wont allow me to surf the net. using ubuntu 9.04. Also will not let other computers, connected to the router, use the internet.
2009-08-31T00:35:00.000Z	Halitech	edlik	is the router turned off or disconnected?
2009-08-31T00:36:00.000Z	Halitech	edlik	then what do you mean that will not let other computers use the internet?
2009-08-31T00:45:00.000Z	Halitech	edlik	check the IPs on the machines when it hangs
