2010-01-15T04:27:00.000Z	Steveturner		are there any alternatives to using pulseaudio and esound?
2010-01-15T04:27:00.000Z	ompaul	Steveturner	try alsa
2010-01-15T04:28:00.000Z	ompaul	Steveturner	 unless you have a really good reason to use it
2010-01-15T04:30:00.000Z	ompaul	Steveturner	some applications and sound methods block others - alsa is fairly stable for multiple sounds at once
