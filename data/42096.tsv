2010-08-31T22:26:00.000Z	adminewb	Seveas	ok
2010-08-31T22:27:00.000Z	adminewb	Seveas	I'm noting in the inbound Firestarter policy settings, there is no place to specify protocol where the forwarded port# is given
2010-08-31T22:28:00.000Z	Seveas	adminewb	sorry, I don't know firestarter. I write iptables rules by hand :)
