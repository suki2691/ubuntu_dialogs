2006-09-19T07:25:00.000Z	Sembiance		So as I begin to use linux more and more I'm going to need to find good replacement apps for apps that I'm used to using under windows (like Winamp for music playing, EAC for perfect audio CD Ripping to flac, etc)  I know about freshmeat and sourceforge are there any other websites or channels where I can ask peoples opinions on good linux apps to fill a certain need without getting on everyones nerves?
