2012-10-08T09:34:00.000Z	jagginess	steven-	i use subsonic, it streams music (there's a subsonic app for it, two of them, but the problem you'll have is the 30 day limit of the subsonic API--- this isnt a 30 day limit on the ipod/iphone app, but on the "API" of the hosting subsonic server-- you can give a little donation to receive a key for unlimitted use of the API)
