2008-11-07T20:36:00.000Z	mymistakedoh		Ok I'm an idiot, I managed to change my home directory but without moving the files in it so now i can only login to a failsafe terminal or unprivilaged user and I need help. How from a terminal can set my user home dir back to what it should be?
2008-11-07T20:38:00.000Z	mymistakedoh		How can I create a privileged user from a command line?
