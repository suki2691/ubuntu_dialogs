2006-05-11T09:11:00.000Z	Zarephath		I have Cable access with dynamic IP assignment....I setup a mail server and pointed it back to my dynamic ip address...however when I tried to send email it bounced saying mail relay not permitted...is there a company where I can get static ips and run everything through the dns for the ips..just using my cable for the connection?

2006-05-11T09:14:00.000Z	Jowi	Zarephath	you can also go with the free option: dyn-dns.org or what green_earz said
