2011-08-05T15:33:00.000Z	elacheche_anis		Why the iso 64b edition called amd64, and can this edition work on an intel cpu(centrino or higher)
2011-08-05T15:34:00.000Z	yagoo	elacheche_anis	amd64 represents 64bit that works on non-itanium intel as well. (reason is because amd was first company to come out with the 64bit)
