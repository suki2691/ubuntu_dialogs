2009-11-04T19:48:00.000Z	zortec		I'm curious... can you also upgrade ext3 to ext4 from jaunty?
2009-11-04T19:48:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	zortec	sure
2009-11-04T19:49:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	zortec	you'd have to do that manually of course...
2009-11-04T19:50:00.000Z	zortec	MasterOfDisaster	I'm just trying to decide between fresh install and upgrade... haven't really touched my linux system in a couple months and can go either way
