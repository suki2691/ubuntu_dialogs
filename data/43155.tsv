2010-06-17T17:50:00.000Z	konryd		hello everyone, I kicked off a vmbuilder script, but it shows no feedback for 10 mins already. It's hard for me to know if it's running at all. Does it have some log files somewhere?
2010-06-17T17:52:00.000Z	konryd		anyone knows of a freenode channel for VM stuff specifically?
2010-06-17T17:52:00.000Z	Beelsebob	konryd	#vbox if you're after specifically that VM program
2010-06-17T17:53:00.000Z	konryd	Beelsebob	HexLaTor: neither of these, I want to make vmbuilder report any progress (it's mute for 10mins already)
