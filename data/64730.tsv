2010-02-10T03:16:00.000Z	Inquiry		Hello, everyone.  Been a while.  I've got an easy one this time.  Trying to upgrade my distro from Hardy Heron 8.04.  Can't seem to get it going.  Anyone know I need to go about this?

2010-02-10T03:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Inquiry	basically you are currently using a LTS release, and Lucid is the next LTS release
2010-02-10T03:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Inquiry	because you are using LTS it's not going to show an upgrade option (by default) until Lucid is released -- there are ways to upgrade to non-LTS (i just don't remember how)
