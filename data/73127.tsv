2009-08-12T18:07:00.000Z	doug_		hey.. i have an avi file that i want to get a sound clip from.  Is there an easy way of doing this.  I was thinking something like place the avi file in a simple video editor such as windows movie maker and just deleting everything but the sound bit I wanted.  Is there an alternative to Movie maker for ubuntu or is there an eaiser way of doing this?
