2006-10-05T07:39:00.000Z	JamesGoddard		hey, quick question - i currently run ubuntu and windows on the same hard drive ... is it possible to kill my windows partition and resize the ubuntu partition so that the drive is completely ubuntu?
2006-10-05T07:40:00.000Z	sethk	JamesGoddard	you can, but it's less risky to just make another partition out of the windows space
2006-10-05T07:40:00.000Z	sethk	JamesGoddard	if you resize partitions, carefully back up everything
2006-10-05T07:40:00.000Z	sethk	JamesGoddard	creating a new partition in the windows spot and mounting it is just as good, really.
