2008-07-03T01:26:00.000Z	feanor88		hello, I have a problem activating my intergraded microphone. I have an HP-nw9440, and I'm using ALSA. When I press to use the sound recorder the recorder opens normally but then when I try to record nothing is happens. I tried to use alsamixer to activate my microphone but in vain. It appers pretty weird. Here is what it appers in my alsamixer output >> http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2zhed15&s=3 does anyone has any idea how to bypass this problem?

2008-07-03T01:28:00.000Z	feanor88	m-c	: yes
