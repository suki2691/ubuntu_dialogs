2008-02-09T02:43:00.000Z	blackv1		I'm trying to install Ubuntu 7.10 on a friends computer but it hangs on boot? It's a Hp Pavillion dv6000 and 7.04 did the same. My sabayon live cd and vector cd worked so I'm not sure what I need to do to install Gutsy on it?

2008-02-09T02:44:00.000Z	blackv1	badkitty	both 7.10 and 7.04 start to load and then just stop and go nowhere?
2008-02-09T02:45:00.000Z	badkitty	blackv1	Thats  odd.. when you say they start to load, you can see any ubuntu images or the cd just  spins or what?
