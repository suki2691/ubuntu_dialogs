2008-05-24T11:00:00.000Z	camilla		Have bought a Hauppauge PVR-150 card. Works fine in Windows Vista. Get my channels. But MythTV can't find any channel when I scan. What am I doing wrong? I thought this should be simple. Am living in sweden and in windows is getting my channel by setting wintv to "cable". I have scanned all freqences twice without finding any channels
