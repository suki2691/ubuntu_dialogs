2011-02-26T18:53:00.000Z	MagicJ		I have two machines which are intended to be very similar, almost identical, in a public location.  I want ti allow firefox but initiate ot from a batch file.  On one machine when I enter 'firefox" it somehow daemonizes since I get the prompt back and firefox runs.  On the other the batch file pauses there until firefox is done.  This second action is what I need.   sum and whereis tell me...

2011-02-26T18:55:00.000Z	MagicJ	MeanEYE	- yes - but note the question: 1) that is NOT what I want and also this is not how it os happening since there is no process associated with my shell once fiorefox has started on the machine where I get the prompt back
