2011-01-11T22:59:00.000Z	Franz24		Could anyone help me? I have exactly the same problem as this guy: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1649969 but still after reading the thread I don't really understand what to do. I've just installed Ubuntu 10.10 on an empty partition as a dual boot with Windows 7, and after the installation when I tried to restart the computer, it freezes on the purple bootscreen. Could anyone tell me what I should do?

2011-01-11T23:00:00.000Z	Franz24		Well, I didn't try all the other versions like the guy in the forum thread, I only tried 10.10
