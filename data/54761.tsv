2011-04-29T17:20:00.000Z	AceKing		I have a question.. I encrypted my home folder when installing 10.10. If I install 11.04 on a new HDD, and hook up the old HDD through USB, will I be able to access my files in the Home folder of the old drive?
2011-04-29T17:20:00.000Z	DamienCassou	AceKing	that's the kind of question that always prevented me from encrypting. But I'm sure there is a way
2011-04-29T17:21:00.000Z	AceKing	DamienCassou	that's what I'm figuring. I just have to find a way how to do it
2011-04-29T17:24:00.000Z	AceKing	DamienCassou	I just found a link that says how to do it. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedPrivateDirectory#Live CD method of opening a encrypted home directory
