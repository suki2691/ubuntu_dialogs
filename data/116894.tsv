2008-07-28T10:22:00.000Z	kernco	LSD|Ninja	displayconfig-gtk only changes the resolution when I'm logged into gnome, but the resolution of the login window is too big and goes off the screen
2008-07-28T10:24:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	kernco	displayconfig-gtk will change the resolution of the input window *and * what you see when you log into GNOME (the one in preference only changes the GNOME res) but the virtual resolution I believe is a GDM issue. If you find out how to correct it, let me know
