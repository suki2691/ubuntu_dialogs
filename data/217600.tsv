2009-06-23T04:03:00.000Z	LewisSharp		Small question. How safe is it to upgrade a linux version (example to 8.0.4 LTS). I am wondering because if it's not safe, I'd need to do a ghost of my main partition or something close to that in case of a major problem.

2009-06-23T04:05:00.000Z	usr13	LewisSharp	Oh, upgrading TO 8.04  sorry... I didn't read carefully.
