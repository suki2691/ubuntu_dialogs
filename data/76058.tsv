2008-10-31T05:31:00.000Z	Poldie		i don't have a swap partition. i have 4 gigs of ram.  do i need a swap partition? and if I don't have one and i run out of memory, will i get a pleasant message or will ubuntu crash or something?
2008-10-31T05:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Poldie	 I run 1GB RAM and without a swap space at all,  and things run pretty well
2008-10-31T05:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Poldie	 I think I read that swap should be no bigger than 512MB RAM
2008-10-31T05:33:00.000Z	Poldie	sebsebseb	i thought swap partitions should be quite big otherwise you're just going to get an extra 512mb ram. why not have 5 gigs of extra 'ram'?
