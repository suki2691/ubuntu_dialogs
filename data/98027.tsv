2011-02-04T08:48:00.000Z	Ciphermagi2		I used to have Ubuntu, and I can't remember what the GUI I used was...it was a really nice 3D thing that could basically make a cube, and it placed a desktop on each face of the cube. You could zoom out of the cube, and rotate it around, and push your windows onto different desktops without having tearing or lag issues. Anyone got any idea?
