2010-09-04T09:54:00.000Z	thune3	mr-ali	http://packages.ubuntu.com/jaunty-updates/firefox has latest
2010-09-04T09:54:00.000Z	thune3	mr-ali	the firefox3.5 series, if you have that installed, will keep you stuck on 3.5 series
2010-09-04T09:55:00.000Z	thune3	mr-ali	i'm saying uninstall firefox3.5 and install firefox, it seems backwards but it will get you to 3.6.8
