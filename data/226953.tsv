2007-03-24T13:14:00.000Z	variant	Ryan`	type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop that will stop the X server
2007-03-24T13:15:00.000Z	variant	Ryan`	and dump you to the first VT
2007-03-24T13:15:00.000Z	variant	Ryan`	if you just press ctrl alt f1/2/3 whatever it will not stop the X server, that will still be running on vt 7 (ctrl alt f7)
