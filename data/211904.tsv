2005-10-18T07:07:00.000Z	twoknee		i have a folder full of ttf fonts that i want to add to the system wide font folder however i cannot mount /media/sda1 as a normal user (its ntfs i believe) and copy it into fonts:///
2005-10-18T07:09:00.000Z	twoknee		anyone know how to move fonts from a windows /dev/sda1 after mounting as root to a user run gnome in fonts:///

2005-10-18T07:13:00.000Z	twoknee	ktogias	no that is not working
