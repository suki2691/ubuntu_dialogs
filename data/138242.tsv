2009-04-25T22:12:00.000Z	h8red		I'm thinking of giving it a gig
2009-04-25T22:12:00.000Z	usser	h8red	i have it running on 512
2009-04-25T22:13:00.000Z	h8red	usser	 it has 700 now, but not sure if I want to give it more since I'm using it to transcode video in NeroVision, which is a pretty intensive task
