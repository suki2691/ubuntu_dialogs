2004-11-19T09:24:00.000Z	Hikaru79		I've got another computer that I want to use as a webserver, and I'm looking for a distribution for it. I've been liking Ubuntu on my desktop computer a LOT so far, so is it also a viable choice as a server distro?
2004-11-19T09:24:00.000Z	Hikaru79		I know there's probably better alternatives
2004-11-19T09:24:00.000Z	Hikaru79		But is it at least plausible?
