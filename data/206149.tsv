2005-12-02T11:09:00.000Z	pgroover		i "upgraded" my system to breezy by editing the sources.list file and ran great for awhile, but now there are "issues" suggestions???
2005-12-02T11:11:00.000Z	pgroover		anyway to revert to hedgehog from breezy without a rebuild?
2005-12-02T11:12:00.000Z	psychocat	pgroover	it's possible but it's best to reinstall
2005-12-02T11:14:00.000Z	psychocat	pgroover	do a search in the forums, i'm sure there's detailed instructions there
