2009-09-03T10:24:00.000Z	GuidMorrow		that's odd
2009-09-03T10:25:00.000Z	GuidMorrow		btw, I was trying to set up network printing on my home network, do I need to set port forwarding on anything, or file and print sharing?
2009-09-03T10:26:00.000Z	eljefe_	GuidMorrow	as long as its local port forwarding shouldnt be needed, unless you specifically blocked ports
