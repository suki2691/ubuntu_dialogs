2005-09-08T06:33:00.000Z	malvo1		He's a linux stud
2005-09-08T06:34:00.000Z	malvo1		i used to use gentoo, then I realized that compiling everything is impractical in a work environment
2005-09-08T06:35:00.000Z	JKnife	malvo1	ive used gentoo before but compiling everything a a AMD K6-2/333mHz didnt seem worthit
