2012-05-22T21:42:00.000Z	JessicaW	MinaKumar	I have a weird situation that I can't figure out. using a dell MD3220i with two direct connections. it was mounted by device name. I changed to uuid and after reboot, one of the directories is missing. df -h still shows that 2TB are being used but the two viewable directories are empty.
