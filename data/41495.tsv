2009-12-18T01:19:00.000Z	bwallen		Flash videos on my laptop slow down my entire computer in ubuntu. The same isn't true for Windows on the same laptop. Is there any way to speed up flash?
2009-12-18T01:20:00.000Z	cdocbo	bwallen	are you using the binary drivers?
2009-12-18T01:20:00.000Z	bwallen	cdocbo	no, the binary ati driver doesn't support my chipset anymore.
2009-12-18T01:21:00.000Z	cdocbo	bwallen	sorry, don't know how well the flgrx/etc driver runs for your card, but you might see if you can use it over the X11 default
