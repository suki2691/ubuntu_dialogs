2009-09-02T18:36:00.000Z	Kjartan2		Hello, I'm having issues with my pure-ftpd-server. I have created users and can access them from the machine itself. But I cannot access them from any other machine. I can however access the apache server from any machine. Any tips? My first time setting up a text-only server.
