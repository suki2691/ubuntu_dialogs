2011-10-20T12:24:00.000Z	szal	jayant	if you can read you clearly have an advantage, that goes for log files too..  you get an eye for what to look for in there
2011-10-20T12:25:00.000Z	jayant	szal	yeah, thats true
2011-10-20T12:25:00.000Z	szal	jayant	some logs already have some initial info that tells you what to look for in case of error
