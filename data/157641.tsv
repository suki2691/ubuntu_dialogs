2009-01-31T06:10:00.000Z	Bsims		EMERGENCY Help needed : I tried to upgrade and got a segfault... and now I get this error dpkg: ../../src/packages.c:221: process_queue: Assertion `dependtry <= 4' failed. I am on ubuntu
2009-01-31T06:11:00.000Z	unkmar	Bsims	did the upgrade include a new kernel?  You might be able to reboot using the old kernel listed in grub.
2009-01-31T06:11:00.000Z	Bsims	unkmar	not rebooted yet, I can't get apt to finish installing it
