2012-03-27T19:20:00.000Z	Newb10101		Hey guys this might be a newb question, but I've searched forums and tried many different things. I put a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10 on a win 7 computer and it installed correctly. I could NOT get anything beyond 640x480 resolution. I tried installing additional drivers for my Nvidia gt430 GPU and the Nvidia X server application didn't do me any good. Now I go to boot into Ubuntu this morning, and it won't even boot. It gives me

2012-03-27T19:27:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	Newb10101	you sent a single line of text, about arp filtering, which is not likely to be realted to any issues. Does the system just freeze there, or reboot etc?
