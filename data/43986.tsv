2010-02-20T10:42:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad		i hate partitioning to be honest. a tedious 2 hours of a progress bar not showing you the detail of how far you are, just going back and forth
2010-02-20T10:42:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad		i've broken an LCD monitor from it once.
2010-02-20T10:43:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad		i DONT want to partition. i will repeat that in bolded caps: I DO NOT WANT TO PARTITION, I WANT TO DO A FULL FORMAT, BUT IMPORT EVERYTHING BEFORE IT FORMATS.
