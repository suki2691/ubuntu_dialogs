2009-02-05T05:24:00.000Z	anom01y		I am trying to install bitchx-gtk / bitchx using hardy but there is no package for hardy, only feisty. Is there a way to convert it ?
2009-02-05T05:26:00.000Z	anom01y		irsii is as good as bitchx ?
2009-02-05T05:27:00.000Z	anom01y		I wanted to check out the bitchx-gtk but I guess thats a no go now..
