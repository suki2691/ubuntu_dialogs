2005-02-07T08:22:00.000Z	veejey		Hello, can anybody guide me how to play midi files in my ubuntu? My card is sb16
2005-02-07T08:23:00.000Z	tritium	veejey	I'm not too familiar with midi players.  Try "apt-cache search midi" on the command line.
2005-02-07T08:23:00.000Z	tritium		browse the package descriptions, and if you see one you want to try, you can install it
2005-02-07T08:26:00.000Z	veejey	tritium	i installed midi player but got no output; it says open /dev/sequencer: No such file or directory
