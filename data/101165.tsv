2008-02-07T22:58:00.000Z	TKingdom	bazhang	any idea why Compiz stopped working after I did 'dist-upgrade' and restarted?
2008-02-07T22:59:00.000Z	bazhang	TKingdom	that was from feisty?
2008-02-07T23:00:00.000Z	bazhang	TKingdom	gutsy to hardy?
2008-02-07T23:01:00.000Z	TKingdom	bazhang	 A friend of mine told me to run 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade', I guess I'm not familiar with what that does exactly.  But compiz was working fine until I ran that and then restarted..
