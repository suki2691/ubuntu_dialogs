2005-12-08T14:26:00.000Z	Widoff	Burk	right click on menu icon and Edit?
2005-12-08T14:27:00.000Z	Burk	Widoff	that's not what I'd like to do.. my intention was to drag several icons into a menu folder..I do not really want to edit them one by one
2005-12-08T14:28:00.000Z	Widoff	Burk	ok, then i'm sorry, i have no answer how to do that.
