2009-12-15T22:06:00.000Z	portn0k	timber	what?
2009-12-15T22:06:00.000Z	timber	portn0k	i want reset the files /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
2009-12-15T22:07:00.000Z	portn0k	timber	"reset"?  resolv.conf does not need to be 'reloaded' after modification, and what are you trying to do with your dhcp client?
