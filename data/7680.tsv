I use Ubuntu 11.10 amd64, installed skype and used it. but after installing some libs skype doenst want to start any more, err msg "bash: /usr/bin/skype: File or Directory not found" even skype is in that dir. an ld /ust/bin/skype tells me " i386 architecture of input file `skype' is incompatible with i386:x86-64 output"
