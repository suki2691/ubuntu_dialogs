2011-02-22T03:28:00.000Z	bc81	ShapeShifter499	you go into the alsamixer?
2011-02-22T03:29:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	bc81	it won't work, after everytime I start my computer it starts with my speakers muted, and I have to use alsamixer from the terminal to unmute
2011-02-22T03:29:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	bc81	however my headphones aren't muted at boot
