2005-12-22T16:08:00.000Z	LjL	Estel	well, from what i've heard, it's not too good either... and i still can't grasp what's bad or uncomfortable with using sudo, personally
2005-12-22T16:09:00.000Z	Estel	LjL	nor can I. I think it might just be ease, especially if doing lots of admin stuff endlessly and wanted a root environment.
2005-12-22T16:09:00.000Z	LjL	Estel	in that case, "sudo -i" is your friend
