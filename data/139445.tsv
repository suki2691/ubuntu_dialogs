2008-06-19T19:13:00.000Z	RyeSeronie		Greetings I have a question.
2008-06-19T19:15:00.000Z	RyeSeronie		I have an Acer Aspire 5520 laptop and am at the ubuntu site to download ubuntu. I do not know which one I should get. Standard or 64bit AMD. In my system info the processor is listed as AMD Turion(tm) 64 X2 Mobile Technology TL-58 1.90 GHz... My assumption would be the 64bit AMD and Intel computers option. Am I correct in my assumption?
