2009-06-24T02:34:00.000Z	warai		hello, last Wow patch 3.1.3 made fps a lot worse, Opengl rendering is simply not working anymore with wine, any suggestions?
2009-06-24T02:35:00.000Z	gogeta	warai	winetricks and install d3dx9
2009-06-24T02:35:00.000Z	gogeta	warai	should let you render dx9 nativly
2009-06-24T02:35:00.000Z	warai	gogeta	I'll try it out.
