2004-11-10T11:26:00.000Z	lev		i've just added a new user (useradd user); the new user can't play audio cdroms (but can mount data cds)
2004-11-10T11:26:00.000Z	lev		is this at all related to sudo or other default permissions?
2004-11-10T11:26:00.000Z	ogra	lev	sudo adduser <your new user> audio
2004-11-10T11:27:00.000Z	lev	ogra	thanks, I'll try that.
