2008-11-08T19:41:00.000Z	ed__		i am installing age of conan on ubuntu using wine and its asking me to insert cd2 but when i try to edject the cd it says cannot unmount.. any idea how to do this?
2008-11-08T19:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	ed__	  i often copy ALL the data files from all the cd's to a single directory. then run wine installername.exe from that directory.. No cd changing needed
2008-11-08T19:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	ed__	 thjat wont work. the cd is locked because its mounted an dbeing accessed.. this is a common issue with WINE.
