2009-09-04T23:58:00.000Z	snowveil		I'm trying to uninstall opera completely.  I ran apt-get update and apt-get remove opera.  Now ubuntu thinks opera is gone (in synaptic and apt-get) but when I run "opera" from a terminal window it still launches

2009-09-04T23:59:00.000Z	snowveil	fccf	Package opera is not installed, so not removed
