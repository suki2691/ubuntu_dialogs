2009-03-11T18:57:00.000Z	snowveil		not sure why
2009-03-11T18:58:00.000Z	snowveil		the mouse worked fine yesterday, but after a reboot it started acting crazy...every click is a double click
2009-03-11T18:58:00.000Z	snowveil		it seems to me like it's recognizing every event coming from the mouse twice
2009-03-11T18:59:00.000Z	mikerose357	snowveil	that sounds like a hardware issue
