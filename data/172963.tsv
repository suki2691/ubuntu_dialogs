2006-09-05T12:11:00.000Z	markrian	TheGateKeeper	Security fixes - though any point releases for Firefox (like 1.5.0.10, if and when it comes out) will likely be uploaded to 6.06 because that's the easiest way to do it
2006-09-05T12:15:00.000Z	markrian	TheGateKeeper	there's no reason for you to upgrade every 6 months
2006-09-05T12:16:00.000Z	markrian	TheGateKeeper	you can stick with dapper for as long as 3 years - except the latest and greatest software won't be (easily) available to you
