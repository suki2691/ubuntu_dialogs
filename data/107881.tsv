2008-01-02T10:25:00.000Z	whuffor		I am getting: "Desktop effects could not be enabled" when I try to enable them for my desktop. I have a new ubuntu 7.10 install. Any way to fix this?

2008-01-02T10:28:00.000Z	beerfan		It doesn't recognize my nvidia card because it's too new
2008-01-02T10:28:00.000Z	whuffor	beerfan	I sort of doubt that. I had kubuntu briefly installed earlier and I could enable lots of funky effects there.
