2009-05-16T21:20:00.000Z	wnstn		in irssi is there a way to filter the results from '/LIST' ?
2009-05-16T21:20:00.000Z	RHorse	wnstn	yes, just use wildcards
2009-05-16T21:21:00.000Z	wnstn	RHorse	I can't seem to get the syntax right, can you help? Say I am looking for all channels on freenode with the word "linux" in the description. How would I search that?
2009-05-16T21:22:00.000Z	RHorse	wnstn	just type /list *linux
