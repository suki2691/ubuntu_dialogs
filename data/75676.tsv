2009-02-26T03:24:00.000Z	DVA5912		I have created a user called webmaster on my machine i have proftpd installed and the users home direcoty is /var/www/ the user can login and get a listing but can not create a file or directory. anyone know why?

2009-02-26T03:25:00.000Z	Sjimmie		then set your group perms to +w for that dir
2009-02-26T03:25:00.000Z	DVA5912	Sjimmie	i dont think so because i can create diretorises with sudo
