2012-05-02T18:07:00.000Z	htorque		hi all! how do i get information about an existing user group on the command line?
2012-05-02T18:09:00.000Z	ThinkT510	htorque	"groups" will tell you which ones you belong to
2012-05-02T18:26:00.000Z	htorque	ThinkT510	is there nothing the other way around? i'd like to get more information about a specific group rather than what "groups" returns.
