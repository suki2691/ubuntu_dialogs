2007-12-05T17:13:00.000Z	Ziggy		there's so many repositories out there when you search the web, it's hard as a beginner to understand which ones you actually do need, can anyone link to a site where just valid/supported/fantastic repos are located
2007-12-05T17:14:00.000Z	Ziroday	Ziggy	well you should only need the repos under System > Administration > Software Sources. But if you want more you usually get them for certain programs
2007-12-05T17:17:00.000Z	Ziggy	Ziroday	ok but medibuntu is good to have for example, i figured that out, and i suppose there are others, all i want is to find a plce where i can see them all, that is the good, valid, supported ones. so i dont need to go find them when i need "that" software
2007-12-05T17:19:00.000Z	Ziroday	Ziggy	I don't know of the top of my head a list but the two supported ones by the communitiy (i think) are seveas and medibuntu repos
