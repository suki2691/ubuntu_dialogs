2005-04-30T14:42:00.000Z	snowblink		is there anyway I can stop DHCP from overwriting my resolv.conf?
2005-04-30T14:43:00.000Z	tga	snowblink	edit /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf and remove the part about domain-name-servers
2005-04-30T14:43:00.000Z	tga	snowblink	but the whole point of dhcp is that you don't have to set that stuff manually
2005-04-30T14:44:00.000Z	snowblink	tga	thanks. I'm in a Windows domain, but want to use my own DNS server (internal domains)...
