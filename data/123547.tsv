2007-08-27T07:26:00.000Z	Sau2		ia have 2 hd's
2007-08-27T07:28:00.000Z	Sau2		master has an installation of windows and old data which i dont want any more. slave disk has xubuntu instaled and valueble data and time spent configurating. I want to format the master disk to ext3 so i can use it easily as storage unit. The problem is that the ntfs partition has a BOOT flag. I think there will be a problem if i just give format. Can some one give some advice on this??
