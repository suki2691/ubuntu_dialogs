2005-07-05T06:39:00.000Z	mikeworking		I am new. May I post my question here? It's regarding a laptop with no floppy or CDROM, but has net conn. and can boot from 64MB USB Memory Stick.
2005-07-05T06:41:00.000Z	mikeworking		I want to install Ubuntu on the only laptop my boss would give me -- it has only a net conn. and 64MB usb mem stick. The hard drive has -- uck -- Win XP. I want to format the hard drive and replace it with Ubuntu.
