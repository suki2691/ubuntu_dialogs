2007-10-20T06:05:00.000Z	Cryoniq		with the fglrx restricted installed now.. I get the composite extension is not available.. if I have glx installed and get major problems.. it says it doesnt have composite extension either.
2007-10-20T06:05:00.000Z	Arenlor	Cryoniq	do you have xserver-xgl installed?
2007-10-20T06:06:00.000Z	Cryoniq	Arenlor	I had but it cripples the graphics at once and compiz wont start anyway telling me missing composite..
2007-10-20T06:07:00.000Z	Arenlor	Cryoniq	xserver-xgl I believe is required, it was for me, don't start an xgl session only start GNOME (the login window option)
