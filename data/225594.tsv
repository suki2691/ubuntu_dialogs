2005-08-01T11:16:00.000Z	nalioth	Harold_researchn	applications > run application > xkill    once it starts, the next thing you touch is dead
2005-08-01T11:17:00.000Z	Harold_researchn	nalioth	Thanks for telling me now; now my t.v. remote is dead.
2005-08-01T11:17:00.000Z	Harold_researchn	nalioth	Ah, who needs t.v. anyway?  It's a waste of time.
