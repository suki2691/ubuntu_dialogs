2007-05-04T14:04:00.000Z	LjL	plagiats	RedACE: no need to put it like that i think =) it's just i guess that, for some reason, many Ubuntu users assume they can just get help in #debian 'cause Ubuntu is based on Debian. anyway, welcome to the *Ubuntu* support channel ;-)
2007-05-04T14:05:00.000Z	plagiats	LjL	: you don't get it. RedACE and I are trying to start a little flamewar here.. :)
2007-05-04T14:06:00.000Z	LjL	plagiats	which is what i'd rather avoid :-)
