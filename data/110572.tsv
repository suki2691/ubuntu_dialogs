2009-05-11T23:08:00.000Z	rheaghen		Anyone, I've recently installed ubuntu onto a thumb drive, and for some reason, I'm now getting a grub 21 error.
2009-05-11T23:09:00.000Z	rheaghen		I've looked up reinstalling grub online, but I am getting no resolve
2009-05-11T23:09:00.000Z	rheaghen		I just ran the ubuntu install cd, and installed to the thumb drive
