2011-04-11T19:59:00.000Z	whoodat		I am running 10.10 and using Openbox as a WM. I would like to use cairo-compmgr for compositing. There is a ppa on the developers site, but it is for debian. Can I use this ppa in ubuntu?
2011-04-11T20:01:00.000Z	whoodat		Can anyone answer this question: Can you use debian ppa in ubuntu?
2011-04-11T20:01:00.000Z	coz_	whoodat	  I would suggest not doing that
