2010-03-19T04:09:00.000Z	whiter		i have a hard drive that i replaced with a larger one from the laptop that i am currently on. it has an install of ubuntu 9.10 on it. im trying to get all my data off of the old hard drive but when i mount it ecryptfs wont let me get into my private directory
2010-03-19T04:09:00.000Z	whiter		how would i fix that?
2010-03-19T04:09:00.000Z	whiter		or... do i have to go back to the old disk and just remove the encryption
