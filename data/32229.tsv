2010-05-09T06:32:00.000Z	razboinik		hello i have a problem with a server, it has bridged eth0 and tap0 this because i need the remote vpn client access so static routes 192.168.222.0/24 which goes for a different gateway on the eth0 network (192.168.111.0), now nat is working fine for 111.X hosts, but even when from 111.1 (brouter) can see a host and connect to it on 222, it cant ping, connect back and browsing doesnt work either
2010-05-09T06:32:00.000Z	razboinik		when seeing iptables log looks like it doesnt know what to do with the packet: PREIN=br0 OUT= PHYSIN=eth0 MAC=00:22:64:f7:bd:c8:00:11:20:44:bd:90:08:00 SRC=192.168.222.110 DST=192.168.111.1 LEN=48 TOS=0x10 PREC=0x00 TTL=125 ID=58587 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=3123 DPT=2222 WINDOW=16384 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0
