2011-05-14T12:48:00.000Z	Evanescence	Almehdi	what is the relation between sudo and do-release-upgrade ? i do not the do-release-upgrade command 's -s option, it says sandbox test ? what is this ?
2011-05-14T12:51:00.000Z	Almehdi	Evanescence	write in terminal "man apt-get" the "-s" is for simulate..
2011-05-14T12:54:00.000Z	Evanescence	Almehdi	yeah, simulate is similar with sandbox test without really write in systemdir
