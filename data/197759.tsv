2006-02-28T15:26:00.000Z	blAckEn3d		i have a problem with nmap: when I run it as a normal user it works okay, but when I run it as root it spits this message: "Failed to determine the netmask of ! : No such device"
2006-02-28T15:27:00.000Z	gnomefreak	blAckEn3d	you shouldnt run programs as root
2006-02-28T15:28:00.000Z	blAckEn3d	gnomefreak	nmap needs root for some scan types
