2010-09-10T14:20:00.000Z	anAngel	Slart	yeap thanks i was reading the man pages anyway
2010-09-10T14:28:00.000Z	anAngel	Slart	thanks again i found the solution but the root default state is locked password - ¨passwd -l root¨ can revert the root to its default state like when ubuntu is installed so logon, su and similar things don't work
2010-09-10T14:29:00.000Z	Slart	anAngel	ah.. didn't know that.. good hunting =)
