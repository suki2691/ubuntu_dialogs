2008-09-14T19:43:00.000Z	candive		I am downloading Redhat CentOS-4.7-i386-binDVD 2.3GB by Torrent the question is what is the difference from iso
2008-09-14T19:44:00.000Z	jbroome_	candive	that should be the iso
2008-09-14T19:46:00.000Z	jbroome_	candive	no, it's a dvd with all three or four install disks on it.
