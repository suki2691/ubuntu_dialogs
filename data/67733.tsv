2009-01-26T02:36:00.000Z	breakfastmonkey		Anyone have any suggestions / experience working with ATHEROS MADWIFI? I am detecting networks but can't connect to them. CARD - ATHEROS AR5007 on UBUNTU 8.10

2009-01-26T02:38:00.000Z	breakfastmonkey	jp_sf	any ideas on how to do that? or links you may know of?
