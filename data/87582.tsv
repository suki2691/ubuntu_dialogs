2008-08-11T11:49:00.000Z	nedwell		After installing (and even after removing) kubuntu from ubuntu, the kubuntu boot screen still appears.  How do I change this back to the ubuntu boot screen?

2008-08-11T11:54:00.000Z	nedwell	Bodsda	I didn't describe well enough...  The kubuntu screen shows during boot (the progress bar loading) prior to getting to the login prompt.  Do you know how I can change that back?  Thanks!
