2009-01-03T20:45:00.000Z	Fish-Face		Hello, my USB mouse stopped working today (nothing like the mouse or packages has changed recently) and in dmesg I get a few repeating error messages about "unable to enumerate USB device"
2009-01-03T20:45:00.000Z	Fish-Face		anyone heard of this, or know a fix? Google seems clueless
