2009-10-26T15:12:00.000Z	Elias_		so uh any idea what to do to get more info about no sound in ubuntu?
2009-10-26T15:14:00.000Z	Elias_		I don't hear sound at all on this atm (had a working windows box not too long ago earlier today, the SB-XFi driver is listed atm)..the ubuntu FAQ didn't have much of anything useful on configuring it there are 3 options I've played with the controls for all 3 HDA Intel HDA HDMI and Realtek .. still no sound from Net video or a vlc DVD
2009-10-26T15:16:00.000Z	Elias_		TY *theadmin* I am downloading now and will let you guys know what's up with it once I reboot and mess around :)
