2009-01-12T04:09:00.000Z	dentid4hed		This is my second attempt, day two of switching to Ubuntu and I still can't get it to install. Progress bar hangs up less than a quarter of the way there.
2009-01-12T04:10:00.000Z	Sylphid	dentid4hed	have you tried the alternate cd
2009-01-12T04:12:00.000Z	Sylphid	dentid4hed	the alt cd is a cli based installer usefull if the regular cd fails
2009-01-12T04:12:00.000Z	Sylphid	dentid4hed	at what point does it fail
