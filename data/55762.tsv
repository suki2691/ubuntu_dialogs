2009-12-30T05:30:00.000Z	biggerfisch	cabrey	run system moniter from the sysem -> administration menu and sort the list by ram usage
2009-12-30T05:34:00.000Z	biggerfisch	cabrey	on the contrary, my ubuntu uses ram more efficiently than systems with m$ and twice the RAM
2009-12-30T05:35:00.000Z	cabrey	biggerfisch	trust me, i know. this is something weird about Ubuntu this time. I've been fine with it on other systems
