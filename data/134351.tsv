2008-05-17T05:31:00.000Z	termagan1		Hi, I'm trying to install the ndstgk program as referenced in https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/internet/C/ndiswrapper.html but it isn't acknowledging that it exists.
2008-05-17T05:31:00.000Z	termagan1		Can anybody advise me?

2008-05-17T05:33:00.000Z	sudobash	termagan1	it should give you the repos on that page
