2008-05-07T06:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	compy	 i find most of these 'docks' to be just eyesore-eyecaney. I stick with the normal gnome panel. Much less hassles
2008-05-07T06:22:00.000Z	compy	Dr_willis	yeah i understand, does AWN use much resources?
2008-05-07T06:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	compy	 no idea - last i tried to use awn - it had so many other problems i found it totally unuseable
