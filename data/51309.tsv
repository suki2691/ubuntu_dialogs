2012-07-25T22:40:00.000Z	DarkSim		I'm using Ubuntu 12.04, I selected Gnome classic, now I have no system tray and I can't log out. It's set to auto login so I can't change if I reboot the comp
2012-07-25T22:41:00.000Z	DarkSim		How can I log out without a system tray?
2012-07-25T22:41:00.000Z	trism	DarkSim	did you remove the indicator-applet? alt+right click, add to panel, indicator applet complete
2012-07-25T22:41:00.000Z	trism	DarkSim	gnome-session-quit; in a terminal will also allow you to log out
