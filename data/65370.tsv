2009-03-08T04:28:00.000Z	tave		 I have 2 systems 1 low and 1 high.  I also have an additional system as a file server. I want to be able to have both low and high data on the file server but limit data access by level of classification(low or high). Does anyone know of any linux solutions for this?

2009-03-08T04:38:00.000Z	tave	sprinkmeier	- I would also like to pass data from low to high and restrict low from seeing high data
