2006-12-03T09:27:00.000Z	nothlit	fuffe	if its your software you should be able to
2006-12-03T09:28:00.000Z	fuffe	nothlit	yes, because this person does have his copyright on some files in the project, but some he have the copyright but havn't edited anything in
2006-12-03T09:31:00.000Z	nothlit	fuffe	oh, then you'll have to consult the gpl site or something
