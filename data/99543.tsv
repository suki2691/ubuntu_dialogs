2008-04-19T09:38:00.000Z	Oath		Every time I boot up any live CD (tryed ubuntu, sabayon, suse, etc) It frezes up mid load. It stopped during "udevs" for sabayon, maybe the others but they didn't list what was happening during the load.
2008-04-19T09:38:00.000Z	Oath		help plz
2008-04-19T09:39:00.000Z	alarmo	Oath	most live cds allow you to skip ACPI and other hardware related features.... have you tried those yet ?
