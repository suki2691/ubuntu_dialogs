2008-03-02T10:08:00.000Z	Roooty		Hi I have to Reinstall Gutsy but the partitioners on the LIve CD / Alt CD just freeze up. What do I do?
2008-03-02T10:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Roooty	Try the gparted livecd
2008-03-20T03:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Roooty	Is fsck detecking a problem in there or is it detecting an improper removal or shutdown on that drive?
2008-03-20T03:10:00.000Z	Roooty	Jack_Sparrow	fsck detects that the boot sector and it's backup don't match when booting the computer, but that is it. I'm pretty sure it's a setting thing but I could be wrong
