2006-09-27T16:20:00.000Z	okiaro		how do i find out which /dev/sd* or /dev/hd* actually have hds on them ?
2006-09-27T16:20:00.000Z	D-side	okiaro	dmesg, for one.
2006-09-27T16:20:00.000Z	okiaro	D-side	 even if they aren't mounted?
2006-09-27T16:21:00.000Z	D-side	okiaro	the kernel doesn't care if its mounted.
