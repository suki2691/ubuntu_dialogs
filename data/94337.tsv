2008-04-23T02:50:00.000Z	pinksoviet		Sorry if I'm repeating my question too much, but does anybody have a way to make sysfsutils start at boot? It's for my trackpoint configuration, and I really don't want to type sudo /etc/init.d/sysfsutils start in terminal every time I start Ubuntu.

2008-04-23T02:51:00.000Z	Speedy	pinksoviet	you can use a small bash script and tell the sessions manager to run it at boot
