2006-01-02T13:10:00.000Z	hume	ilba7r	that won't ruin somthing that gij does then? I installed sun java with java-tools and dpkg
2006-01-02T13:12:00.000Z	ilba7r	hume	i installed sun java directly. you can rename your old link and see how it go. I am confident it will not cause troubles but just in case you will have your old symbolic link
