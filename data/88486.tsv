2008-06-06T22:34:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Agion	What do you mean by disturbances?
2008-06-06T22:35:00.000Z	Agion	ASULutzy	hard to say in english since it isn't my native language but black lines if that helps?
2008-06-06T22:36:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Agion	I believe there are different #ubuntu channels for different languages... I don't know if black lines mean artifacts or what, 1) do you have the newest drivers for your card, 2) do you expereince the same problems in other operating systems, 3) yea, what happens when you do what tj83 said and use metacity
