2011-02-15T03:00:00.000Z	mtkorb		I'm getting a strange error that keeps printing to my terminal. Is there a way to find out what process is writing it?
2011-02-15T03:02:00.000Z	lostintime	mtkorb	what strange error?
2011-02-15T03:04:00.000Z	lostintime	mtkorb	this gets printed to a new terminal?
2011-02-15T03:05:00.000Z	mtkorb	lostintime	I think it's getting printed to stderr.
