2008-12-27T06:10:00.000Z	hashbrowns	white-sheep	well the wubi installer makes a file inside of windows to use instead of having a regular partiiton.  I chose to do it this way cause nobody could help me with my dualbooting problems but I could get it to install/dualboot correctly via wubi but there is a 30GB cap in the drop down box during the install process.  Do you know how to change/override this value?
