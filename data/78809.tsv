2008-11-06T20:42:00.000Z	klync		can i get some advice on a good calendering program? i just switched to thunderbird for email, and i've been using orage as a cal. ideally, this would integrate with our exchange server
2008-11-06T20:42:00.000Z	ikonia	klync	evolution is all that can intergrate with exchange really
2008-11-06T20:43:00.000Z	klync	ikonia	the evolution plugin won't work with our exchange server version, and i don't like evo anyway... sensible suggestion tho - thx
