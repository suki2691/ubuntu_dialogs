2010-03-04T05:23:00.000Z	KaiForce	GeekSquid	do you know anything about setting up dual monitors with Intel graphics (845GM)
2010-03-04T05:27:00.000Z	GeekSquid	KaiForce	yes and no, yes in that I have been able to do it prior to the intel regression of 2009, and no in that I haven't been able to get it to work since... and stopped buying intel hardware
2010-03-04T05:27:00.000Z	KaiForce	GeekSquid	ok, then it isn't me?  Intel driver is jacked?
