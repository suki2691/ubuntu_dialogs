2008-08-22T16:23:00.000Z	CyberCod		what? flash apps making ff lock up and take up 100% cpu?
2008-08-22T16:23:00.000Z	tzd	CyberCod	do you have adblock installed?
2008-08-22T16:25:00.000Z	tzd	CyberCod	your issue is perhaps an adblock related thing.... at least that was what causing my ff to go use 100 cpu
