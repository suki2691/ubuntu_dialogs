2009-06-25T08:37:00.000Z	electro		I can only get sound if I am root.  What groups do I need to be in for 9.04 ?  groups I am in...  adm dialout cdrom audio plugdev lpadmin admin sambashare
2009-06-25T08:38:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	electro	why are you root, you use sudo for root access.. did you disable your sound from another group by accident?
2009-06-25T08:38:00.000Z	electro	vip3rousmango	no, I just ran sudo gnome-sound-properties  and it worked as root, not as my user
2009-06-25T08:40:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	electro	hmm.. don't know why its requesting sudo.. mine isn't.
