2011-02-05T16:36:00.000Z	DanielParker		anyone: how can I backup my printer-settings+drivers?
2011-02-05T16:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	DanielParker	most of the stuf if not all can be found and backed up at /etc/cups/ dir
2011-02-05T16:38:00.000Z	DanielParker	mkanyicy	I want to because it was a real hassle installing it... I'm upgrading from 9.10 to 10.10 and it doesn't seem to be a lot better there... so just in case I want to save the printer-settings/drivers
2011-02-05T16:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	DanielParker	I found more links in the printer drivers spread all over in /usr/lib/cups/ /usr/bin /usr/sbin  as partly seen in the package properties of cups visible in synaptic
