2006-07-24T14:54:00.000Z	Wikey		hi, whom can I contact if I plan to rebrand ubuntu? I plan to roll out ubuntu desktop on customers pc, but "ubuntu" in my national language means "stuck" more or less. So I wonder is it possible that I can change the name but retain the logo, etc
2006-07-24T14:56:00.000Z	Wikey		not sure for African, but in Malay "buntu" means stuck
2006-07-24T14:56:00.000Z	Wikey		so when we do a presentation on ubuntu, the customers actually ask,"ubuntu...... can it really work?"
2006-07-24T14:57:00.000Z	tristan	Wikey	and I am sure you answer : No is doesn't work, that's why we use it ;)
