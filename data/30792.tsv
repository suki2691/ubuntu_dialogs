2010-07-25T13:24:00.000Z	sunk8	suprengr	driver problem? the kernels of both Ubuntu and openSUSE are the same. I wonder what's wrong.
2010-07-25T13:26:00.000Z	suprengr	sunk8	several users have had identical problem... all ok up to 9.04 then in 9.10 - exactly as described by yourself.   See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/492990
2010-07-25T13:27:00.000Z	sunk8	suprengr	nope. That person had a wireless. probably a propereitry driver. I am using rj45 ethernet cable.
