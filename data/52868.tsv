2009-07-08T22:53:00.000Z	Guest60768		what is the name of the ubuntu channel where I can get help?
2009-07-08T22:53:00.000Z	Pici	Guest60768	That would be here.
2009-07-08T22:54:00.000Z	Guest60768	Pici	THanks I remember last time I asked for help on the default channel they said unkind things to me
2009-07-08T22:54:00.000Z	Pici	Guest60768	I'm sorry that happened, but this is the proper place to ask your Ubuntu support questions.
