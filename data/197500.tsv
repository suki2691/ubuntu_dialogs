2007-08-07T10:28:00.000Z	julian_		are there any other linux tablet users around? the lack of a good onscreen keyboard is pointing me towards the direction of writing one, but I want to make sure theres no other keyboards before I start doing it
2007-08-07T10:29:00.000Z	Flannel	julian_	http://tuxmobil.org/tablet_unix.html scroll down, near the bottom is a bunch of input methods, including onscreen keyboards.  (Im sure that's not exhaustive)
2007-08-07T10:31:00.000Z	julian_	Flannel	thanks.  I've seen that a few times, the list is kind of old though.  I just wanted to know if theres something I hadn't seen before I get started
