2011-04-20T23:05:00.000Z	Aer		Hi, i was wondering if anyone could give me a hand, when i use the "update manager" i get the following error message "Not all updates can be installed" "Run a partial upgrade, to install as many updates as possible"
2011-04-20T23:05:00.000Z	Aer		What would a partial upgrade be ? would that upgrade me from 10.4 LTS to the latest non LTS ?
2011-04-20T23:07:00.000Z	Aer		anyone lol ? :P
