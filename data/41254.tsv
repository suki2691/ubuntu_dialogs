2009-12-07T23:38:00.000Z	fluxnuk3r		hey guys, I'm trying to install Ubuntu, and as I am most accustomed to Slackware, not being able to simply edit the boot line for the install CD is killing me. My hardware is rather troublesome, and I have to add the parameters "pci=nomsi" and "pci=nopcmcia" for the distro to read my hard drive, however, editing this line in ubuntu has not made any difference, can I get some suggestions?

2009-12-07T23:39:00.000Z	fluxnuk3r	addisonj	I have added the lines to the boot line, but it doesn't seen to make any difference, adduser fails with error 11 and everything goes downhill from there
2009-12-07T23:45:00.000Z	fluxnuk3r	addisonj	right now I am burning 8.04 to see if it loads any different
