2010-11-16T09:03:00.000Z	slgma		is there a way to open isos with gnomebaker
2010-11-16T09:03:00.000Z	slgma		like gnomebaker whatever.iso from terminal (obviouslt that doesnt work or i wouldnt have asked)

2010-11-16T09:09:00.000Z	Kevin`	slgma	I may not be much help if you persist in the question (others should), I normally just use wodim/cdrecord or growisofs ;p
