2008-05-02T22:40:00.000Z	selocol		Hello, I just made a big mistake and was wondering if someone could help me. I deleted a file called "eggdrop" which was a shortcut to start the program I think. Because I can no longer start my eggdrop bot by typing ./eggdrop. Is there an easy way to recreate this file? Thanks...
