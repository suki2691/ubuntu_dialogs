2010-03-05T02:08:00.000Z	Madwill		i'm totally new to ubuntu and i need a LAMP server with RED5 on 2 seperate static IPS i feel a lot more confortable with ubuntu Desktop because of the visual UI is there a big drawBack of using desktop instead of server ???
2010-03-05T02:08:00.000Z	Madwill		i heard ubuntu server is only ubuntu desktop without UI
2010-03-05T02:09:00.000Z	neurochrome	Madwill	you can run a server with a GUI, the server edition doesn't have a DE to save resources
