2010-06-14T18:12:00.000Z	Ta3v		hey guys I forget, but what flag do I need to use to copy a directory? i did cp eggdrop/ and I got "omitting directory"
2010-06-14T18:12:00.000Z	Ta3v		I know theres a flag I need to include.
2010-06-14T18:12:00.000Z	llutz	Ta3v	cp -a or cp -r
2010-06-14T18:48:00.000Z	llutz	Ta3v	are you sure its /dev/sdb (device), not a partition?
