2005-11-06T07:40:00.000Z	Stormx2		Still looking into capitalizing the first letters of words in directory names in a certain directory (nirvana - in utero > Nivana - In Utero)

2005-11-06T07:41:00.000Z	Stormx2	michele	I can, but i'd need some regex to do it for all dirs in the directory, and to that pattern
