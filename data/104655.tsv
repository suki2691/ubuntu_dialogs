2009-11-28T00:31:00.000Z	_W_		What should I use to install Ubuntu from Windows onto a bootable USB drive without using any other boot media? I have tried putting the LiveCD image on a partition of the flash drive, but it then refuses to install to the remaining partition of that drive, as it cannot unmount the drive "to finalize partitions" (despite me not making any new partitions except marking that one as /)
