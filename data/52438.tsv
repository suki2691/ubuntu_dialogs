2009-09-29T03:25:00.000Z	mirsal		:) well, it turns out that I have a question: is there a mechanism that would allow me to set default gconf keys for new users on an oem install ?

2009-09-29T03:29:00.000Z	mirsal	erUSUL	oh, I didn't know it could do that, as I only used it to set gconf keys for already created users, I'll read the manpage then, thanks.
