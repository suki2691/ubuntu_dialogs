2009-12-17T06:41:00.000Z	gbear14275		so I added the debian sid repository to my source.list and am trying to upgrade a package but I run into this error:  python-libvirt:
2009-12-17T06:41:00.000Z	gbear14275		  Depends: python (<2.6) but 2.6.4-0ubuntu1 is to be installed
2009-12-17T06:41:00.000Z	gbear14275		what does that mean?
2009-12-17T06:42:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	gbear14275	that means you are about to muck up your box..
