2007-10-12T07:22:00.000Z	jaybuntu		good morning!
2007-10-12T07:22:00.000Z	jaybuntu		what causes the sreensaver to freeze ubuntu?
2007-10-12T07:23:00.000Z	heguru	jaybuntu	is it freezing immediately after the screensaver starts? or after like 15-30 mins?
2007-10-12T07:25:00.000Z	heguru	jaybuntu	well if it was more, I would've suggested looking into standby settings
