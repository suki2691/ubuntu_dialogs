2008-08-21T06:50:00.000Z	poet		First time installing Ubuntu 8.04. It never asked me to specify a "root" user password during the install. How do I create one as I'm logged in with just the reg user.

2008-08-21T06:53:00.000Z	Neuro2112	poet	sudo passwd is the correct out of the flood of mistypes you jsut got :)
