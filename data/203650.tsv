2007-04-27T15:36:00.000Z	kane77	anonymousone	ask to ask protocol wastes more bandwidth than any ask protocol.. so just ask your question
2007-04-27T15:39:00.000Z	kane77	anonymousone	useradd if that's what you want...
2007-04-27T15:41:00.000Z	kane77	anonymousone	if you want to add user with super-powers (admin ;) ) you use "sudo adduser $user admin" (you replace $user with name of the user you want to create..)
