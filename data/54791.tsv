2009-06-09T14:44:00.000Z	flashman5	Tiede	I'm pretty sure it will be the next step:) As I wrote about 5 minutes before I try to boot ubuntu netbook remix from pendrive on an aspire one to install the OS but it freezes at the starting screen where you select to install ubuntu, no response to keyboard
2009-06-09T14:45:00.000Z	Tiede	flashman5	have you checked the md5sums to make sure it's ok?
