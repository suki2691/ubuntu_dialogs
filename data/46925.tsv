2010-05-13T21:05:00.000Z	KittyBoots		Hello all!  I am trying my hand at doing some video work and I am trying to convert formats.  I am using ffmpeg, just find from the command prompt, but now I am trying to use the WinFF gui.  I want to continue using my custom command but I am having trouble adjusting the preset to recognize the source file and the destination file.  Anyone here have experience dealing with this?

2010-05-13T21:06:00.000Z	ChogyDan	KittyBoots	that's what I use for simple stuff
2010-05-13T21:09:00.000Z	KittyBoots	ChogyDan	I am converting *.mts which is AVCHD to AVI.  I don't want to lose any of the quality.  Will Avidemux support this?
