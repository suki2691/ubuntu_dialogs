2010-08-08T07:19:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Peter-C|Laptop	1) it will autoconnect by default, 2) yes
2010-08-08T07:20:00.000Z	Peter-C|Laptop	ilovefairuz	how? also it doesn't connect to my LAN - os that because it is not secured?
2010-08-08T07:21:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Peter-C|Laptop	are you using network manager? and it should autoconnect by default, right-click and select edit connections
