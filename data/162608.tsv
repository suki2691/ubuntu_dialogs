2007-07-13T16:18:00.000Z	tuxix		ozzman> compiz fusion is more advanced than beryl since it's the fusion of both beryl and compiz
2007-07-13T16:18:00.000Z	tuxix		because beryl is just a fork of compiz
2007-07-13T16:18:00.000Z	PriceChild	tuxix	that's not true... beryl was compiz originally... doesn't make either any more advanced... now please to -effects
