2008-02-26T11:09:00.000Z	Rukus		this may be a dumb question, but stability is important to me in an OS .... but i kinda have  this thing for trying out new stuff. Is 8.04 alpha 5 stable enough for someone to run without any "foreseeable" problems?
2008-02-26T11:10:00.000Z	Rukus		whats the frambuffer? isn't that like UMA useage?
2008-02-26T11:10:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Rukus	i think so, but YMMV and no guarantees of course
