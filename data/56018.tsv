2011-09-11T20:54:00.000Z	awsoonn		hi all, quick one here I hope: i want to do a global search and replace via CLI via sed but it doesn't work quite right. I use sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' file which works for words with spaces on both side of the search argument, but not if what I'm searching for is in (foo). help?

2011-09-11T20:58:00.000Z	mkanyicy	awsoonn	I see what you mean
2011-09-11T20:58:00.000Z	mkanyicy	awsoonn	no, I dont see it
