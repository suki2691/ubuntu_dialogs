2005-06-27T07:31:00.000Z	vinux	mae	although when I was new to slackware I thought I would install a firewall. But it went very wrong when I didn't read the info files and I installed a firewall system that plays like a linux system so it wiped out my system files lol. I'm sure you know what happened then..... Reinstall baby! Stupid me
