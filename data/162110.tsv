2008-03-01T05:28:00.000Z	teqsun		If i run the VMware through ubuntu can i run xp as a virtual machine (the one I already have installed)

2008-03-01T05:31:00.000Z	DIL	teqsun	yes, just a fyi you should be able to use vmplayer and create a vm with xp - i would use the the download from vwware site though
