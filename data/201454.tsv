2006-01-23T16:12:00.000Z	asparagui		i have a winxp box, i wanna add a hard drive and put ubuntu on that.
2006-01-23T16:12:00.000Z	asparagui		is there a way to do that without reinstalling xp?
2006-01-23T16:13:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	asparagui	Yeah, just put the new HDD in and install ubuntu on it.
2006-01-23T16:13:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	asparagui	Ubuntu will install Grub, which lets you dual-boot, and it'll auto-detect and configure it for your WinXP installation.
