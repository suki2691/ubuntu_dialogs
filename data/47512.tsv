2009-11-30T14:57:00.000Z	PFA		hey, i'm having ridiculous problems w/ hibernate on critical battery power on karmic. first is that it hibernates even *after* i plug in the adapter, sometimes seemingly when it still has tons of power left (and always right after); second is that when it wakes up often it blackscreens and freezes until i press the power button and force shut down.
