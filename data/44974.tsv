2009-10-28T07:45:00.000Z	AntiStrange		can someone help me with how I would dual boot ubuntu with windows 7? I already have windows 7 (only) installed on this box. Link?
2009-10-28T07:46:00.000Z	almoxarife	AntiStrange	I would recommend wubi
2009-10-28T07:47:00.000Z	AntiStrange	almoxarife	will that put ubuntu on a separate partition? or is that more of a virtual machine thing?
