2005-09-15T09:11:00.000Z	chiisai		I am currently using linux-image-2.6.10-5-386 because Synaptic wanted to update that package. However, I can't boot Ubuntu anymore. I'm having this problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=696  - and as you can see, there is no solution yet. Is it possible for me to just... downgrade somehow? I don't know what version I was using before.

2005-09-15T09:12:00.000Z	bur[n] er	chiisai	did you remove them?
2005-09-15T09:13:00.000Z	bur[n] er	chiisai	maybe... never seen that
