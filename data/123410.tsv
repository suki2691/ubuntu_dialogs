2007-08-28T09:08:00.000Z	super-6-1		quick question where does wine install applications at?
2007-08-28T09:08:00.000Z	Ch0Hag	super-6-1	~/.wine/ IIRC
2007-08-28T09:11:00.000Z	Ch0Hag	super-6-1	Type nautilus ~/.wine in a terminal
2007-08-28T09:11:00.000Z	Ch0Hag	super-6-1	And have you actually run something in wine yet?
