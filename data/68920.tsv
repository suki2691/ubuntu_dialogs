2009-07-22T03:15:00.000Z	Geforce88		i have an IWILL dvd266-r mainboard with a dvd  rom and when i attempt to install 8.10 on it the bios detects the disk drive, boots into the start up/ install menu, asks me about language, then when it looks for the cdrom, it fails. this happens on 8.04, 8.10, 9.04, and with different drives tried and a fresh copy burned, any ideas, or workarounds? or, where can i geta floppy disk to load apati drivers from

2009-07-22T03:17:00.000Z	Titan8990	Geforce88	and hardware support is not the same
