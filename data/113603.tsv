2008-02-05T22:47:00.000Z	Arelis		Hey guys. I am looking for an alternative to firefox, for Ubuntu. I've tried epiphany, but didn't like it. I'd use opera if it didn't have a screwed up Flash plugin. What browsers are there? They need to support Adobe Flash

2008-02-05T22:47:00.000Z	Arelis	jrgotti	no, but since it's based on firefox..
2008-02-05T22:47:00.000Z	jrgotti	Arelis	ahhh...you bring up a valid point :P
