2009-10-25T00:56:00.000Z	josh_moore		Is there anyone here who can help me with a fresh install of 9.04 desktop x64, to use two 640gb drives as software raid0? I'm bashing my head against the all all day on this
2009-10-25T00:56:00.000Z	carbm1_	josh_moore	did you use the Alternate CD to install?
2009-10-25T00:57:00.000Z	carbm1_	josh_moore	 Yes.  You might want to google to figure all that out.  But you really should use the alternate CD to do a software RAID install. You understand that RAID0 is not redundant though right?
2009-10-25T00:59:00.000Z	carbm1_	josh_moore	I gots to go but if you'll google Ubuntu Alternate RAID you'll find plenty of guides.
