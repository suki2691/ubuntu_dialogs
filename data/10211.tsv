2011-08-22T15:24:00.000Z	vkushner		I need to apt-get update an old jaunty server but all the sources seem to be goneâ€¦ where can I get a sources.list for jaunty?
2011-08-22T15:25:00.000Z	rumpe1	vkushner	jaunty is dead
2011-08-22T15:26:00.000Z	vkushner	rumpe1	well, duh! I know its officially dead. this doesn't change the fact that I got this client with a couple years old jaunty server and I just need to install some package.
2011-08-22T15:28:00.000Z	rumpe1	vkushner	what's the point? jaunty isn't even LTS.
