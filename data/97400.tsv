2008-03-27T12:09:00.000Z	Gopher99		if i'm on a dualboot macbookpro,(osx/ win xp) through BootCamp, would installing ubuntu on it(tri-boot) rid of BootCamp's control?
2008-03-27T12:10:00.000Z	bod_	Gopher99	yes, unless u skip the grub installer
2008-03-27T12:11:00.000Z	Gopher99	bod_	if i skipped the grub installer, do you know if the BootCamp app would add the ubuntu distro into the options? (I know this probably isnt your area of expertise)
2008-03-27T12:12:00.000Z	bod_	Gopher99	i doubt it,.,. but u could add it by hand,. or just allow ubuntu to install grub and let it use that
