2010-07-18T14:50:00.000Z	ManDay		How do I execute a script directly after X has started? rc.d ?
2010-07-18T14:50:00.000Z	violinappren	ManDay	.xinitrc perhaps ?
2010-07-18T14:51:00.000Z	ManDay	violinappren	yeah that sounds ok - whats the system-vide version of that?
2010-07-18T14:52:00.000Z	violinappren	ManDay	I'm not sure if there's one, perhaps it's the rc.d script
