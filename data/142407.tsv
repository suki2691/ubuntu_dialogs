2008-02-04T16:36:00.000Z	Bagualas	howlingmadhowie	hummm, but i need keyboard and mouse to workd =\
2008-02-04T16:37:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	Bagualas	my suggestion would be just to try it out. it's possible that mouse and keyboard are converted to ps2 connections on the motherboard itself
2008-02-04T16:39:00.000Z	Bagualas	howlingmadhowie	i will try, thanks man! :)
