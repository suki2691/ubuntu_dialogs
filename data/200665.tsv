2006-01-17T09:27:00.000Z	smash3r		hello! I would like some help to mount my dvd-rom since I tried many times to mount it and that it seems to be not recongnized by ubuntu (any issue with sony dvd burners?)
2006-01-17T09:29:00.000Z	cello_rasp	smash3r	i dunno about sony - they tend to be fine -  but check out fstab
2006-01-17T09:30:00.000Z	smash3r	cello_rasp	I checked the fstab and my hdc isnt there
2006-01-17T09:31:00.000Z	cello_rasp	smash3r	try including a line to mount it then :>
