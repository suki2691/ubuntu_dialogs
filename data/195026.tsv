2009-10-24T00:36:00.000Z	mayki		i have a question, why is it that when firefox doesn't close completely, i can't open a new one? i get the message "Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system." but if i have a firefox window open, i can open as many other windows as i want? do they all run on the same process?
