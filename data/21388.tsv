2011-02-07T20:22:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	compdoc	so I can just add a bridge in /etc/network/interfaces? Is there a "correct" way to be doing this so they don't fight?
2011-02-07T20:23:00.000Z	compdoc	Lunar_Lamp	to be honest, I use bridges on another OS, and havent done it in ubuntu
2011-02-07T20:27:00.000Z	compdoc	Lunar_Lamp	I use a bridges to share network cards, but I leave one network card alone for the host OS to use
