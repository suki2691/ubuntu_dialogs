2007-01-04T11:24:00.000Z	roach_		I'm installing Ubuntu, I'm a n00b, and I'm confused about the hostname.  The prompt says "The hostname is a single word...", but I'm wondering if it should be "mybox" or "mybox.mydomain.mytld"...?
2007-01-04T11:25:00.000Z	elyon	roach_	 Just one word... don't bother with the periods.  It can be anything you want it to be.
2007-01-04T11:26:00.000Z	roach_	elyon	- that's what I figured, but I wasn't clear on the repercussions...  will (e.g.) "hostname --fqdn" still work?
2007-01-04T11:26:00.000Z	elyon	roach_	 Now that's more than one word ;)
