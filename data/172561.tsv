2012-07-04T18:05:00.000Z	New		i downloaded the new ubuntu 12.04 from ubuntus website, my hardware is basic, single core, 2gigs of ram. 2.2 ghz. i still believe it should boot properly. whats odd is as i shut windows down at the blank screen i saw a flash of the operations system which let me to believe its a possible bios issue
2012-07-04T18:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	New	 you did a normal install? or are you using Wubi?
2012-07-04T18:07:00.000Z	New	Dr_Willis	i used the windows installer and the ubuntu iso from ubuntu's website
2012-07-04T18:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	New	 so thats a 'wubi' install then.
