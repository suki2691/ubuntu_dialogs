2011-03-23T05:59:00.000Z	vol7ron		hello all, I'm an ubuntu noob and did "nvidia-xconfig" inside a VMware Player -- now I can't boot to the gui (only console)
2011-03-23T06:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vol7ron	vmware will use a virtualized video adapter, not an nvidia one
2011-03-23T06:01:00.000Z	vol7ron	ActionParsnip	yeah I was just hoping that it would make Desktop Effects work.
2011-03-23T06:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vol7ron	I suggest you ask in #vmware on how to enable 3D. The vmware video driver is already in a default install
