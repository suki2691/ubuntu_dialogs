2007-11-25T11:22:00.000Z	macksting		Second day on Linux. There's a long command I've been using to open a program with, like, parameters and stuff. I know I'll be doing this regularly. I hear tell of "scripts," or something akin. First off, am I hallucinating? Second off, how do I make one if, in fact, they are not akin to Ogopogo? :)

2007-11-25T11:23:00.000Z	macksting		Like I said, second day.
2007-11-25T11:24:00.000Z	crazy6	macksting	you mean like for command line stuff? or just for starting programs?
