2012-05-30T19:11:00.000Z	amelia_		Hej -- on a machine running 11.10, do i want to do the update manager route to 12.04 or do a fresh install from LiveUSB? Pros/Cons of each?

2012-05-30T19:13:00.000Z	amelia_	OerHeks	release upgrade? And do you mean just go the "Update Manager" route and have the USB just in case?
2012-05-30T19:13:00.000Z	OerHeks	amelia_	yes, this is the safest way to do.
