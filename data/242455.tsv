2009-02-01T17:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	uni4dfx	it's limited by how fast your network is
2009-02-01T17:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	uni4dfx	is everything else exactly the same?
2009-02-01T17:44:00.000Z	gordonjcp	uni4dfx	no, I mean, have you changed anything in your network apart from installing Ubuntu on a machine that previously had Slackware?
