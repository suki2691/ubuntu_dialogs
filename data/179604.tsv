2009-09-14T20:38:00.000Z	jrib	NakidGirl_With_I	df -h   is probably what you want
2009-09-14T20:39:00.000Z	jrib	NakidGirl_With_I	ubuntu doesn't call partitions c: etc.... The command I gave you will show you the size of the partitions on your disk.  If you want the size of the actual disk try sudo fdisk -l
