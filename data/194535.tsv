2007-04-19T12:40:00.000Z	r3m0t	fiveiron	did it give any extra messages?
2007-04-19T12:41:00.000Z	fiveiron	r3m0t	only that and it said to file a bug report with the contents of /var/log/dist-upgrade/
2007-04-19T12:41:00.000Z	r3m0t	fiveiron	then please collect the contents of /var/log/dist-upgrade and post them somewhere - e.g. to the forum
