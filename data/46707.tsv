2010-01-27T04:58:00.000Z	jordy240		I just plugged in my headphones and was listing to music. well I went to watch a youtube video, and the sound was 2000% louder than the music and nearly destroyed my eardrums. this is exactly why linux will never ever be on the standard everyday desktop; because it's more concerned with looking 'leet' than actually functioning
2010-01-27T04:59:00.000Z	chelz	jordy240	go into audio settings
2010-01-27T04:59:00.000Z	jordy240	chelz	sorry, but how does that help? at all?
2010-01-27T04:59:00.000Z	chelz	jordy240	it's an audio issue and that's where you adjust audio levels. lol
