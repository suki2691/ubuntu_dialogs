It seems that now (since 3.0) it's unsupported and the new mac version doesn't have master/ap.  is this accurate in that trying to do more is frutless until the mac80211 verion is finished?

2012-04-25T04:13:00.000Z	JensenDied	christhisisgool	which module? nl80211?
2012-04-25T04:15:00.000Z	JensenDied	christhisisgool	thanks, that will kill some time before i can call it quits or see how unfinished it is.
