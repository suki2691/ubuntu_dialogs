2009-04-01T21:33:00.000Z	Samper	mbeierl	I am starting up a community group here in Ottawa called Computers For Communities (http://computersforcommunities.ca). The recipe is simple, take cats off computers from those throwing them out, slap on Ubuntu and traing people on how to use it. then give the computers away to those facing barriers to adopting technology. Perhaps you might know some people in the local Linux community that may be interested. perhaps yourself.
