2005-08-04T16:36:00.000Z	Thunderguy		Is there a way to completely reconfigure Gnome?
2005-08-04T16:36:00.000Z	mjr	Thunderguy	delete (or move elsewhere for safekeeping) your .gnome* and .gconf* directories, that should about do it
2005-08-04T16:37:00.000Z	mjr	Thunderguy	recommend doing that while not logged into gnome, or restarting gnome directly after
