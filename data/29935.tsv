2011-05-19T14:15:00.000Z	Kevin		I know this is a little OT byt, Is there a free OS that will run exe.'s without VM windows?
2011-05-19T14:17:00.000Z	p_res	Kevin	it all depends on what you're trying to install/run.

2011-05-19T14:21:00.000Z	Kevin	p_res	I was thinking it might be a viable alternative if someones Os breaks.  I could be like hey, you could run Ubuntu and still run blah blah blah games or whatever.  Or itunes (thats messed up wine to run a mac program)
