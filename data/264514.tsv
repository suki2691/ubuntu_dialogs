2004-10-29T06:44:00.000Z	moose6589		heh i'm a linux noob, i just have simple question.. i've been trying to install gaim 1.0.1, so i extract to a folder, navigate there using cd, then type ./configure
2004-10-29T06:45:00.000Z	Treenaks	moose6589	you'll want to use the gaim package, compiling is not necessary
2004-10-29T06:46:00.000Z	Treenaks	moose6589	you'll most likely want the package, either from main or universal, but if you REALLY want to compile, apt-get install build-essential
