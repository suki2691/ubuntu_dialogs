2008-02-14T22:40:00.000Z	Hammer89		**tries again one last time for a bit... I think this might be extremely urgent** I'm not sure but something might've just gotten seriously screwed up when I ran aptitude autoclean.... could someone please take a look at this for me? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/55991/  Any help would really be appreciated... I'd rather catch any issues now than get an awful surprise next time I try to boot up my computer
