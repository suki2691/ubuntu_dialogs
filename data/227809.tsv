2005-07-20T10:24:00.000Z	NerdGirl		Question: trying to setup my display with 5.04.  I have a Samsung syncmaster LCD monitor and and INtel i845GL chipset (shared memory).  Can't get the resolution to change from 640x480 at 59 Hz, and my attempts to edit xorgconfig have simply disabled X entirely.
2005-07-20T10:25:00.000Z	NerdGirl		no.  I'm pretty new to all this, just been googling around for anyone with similar problems...
2005-07-20T10:25:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	NerdGirl	whats the problem?
2005-07-20T11:52:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	NerdGirl	is having some serious Xorg problems for a chipset that HSOULD not be giving her any grief
