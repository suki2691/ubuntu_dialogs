2010-09-12T07:48:00.000Z	brummbaer	hv_monk	there's tons of servers, xchat comes w/ a big list of a few
2010-09-12T07:50:00.000Z	hv_monk	brummbaer	and all these servers host these channels. No, it can't be. so it is like xchat has information which server is hosting what channel, and creates a connection depending upon the channel one chooses? am i making sense here?
