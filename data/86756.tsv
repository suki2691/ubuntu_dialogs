2008-07-09T02:35:00.000Z	Storrgie		has anyone installed vista to another partition AFTER they installed ubuntu?

2008-07-09T02:36:00.000Z	Storrgie	__yy_	I cant get vista to install :(
2008-07-09T02:37:00.000Z	__yy_	Storrgie	ahh, an entirely different problem, what do you mean you can't get it to install, what goes wrong?
