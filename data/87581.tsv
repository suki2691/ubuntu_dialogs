2009-05-02T06:20:00.000Z	nedwell		I dual boot Windows XP Home and Ubuntu Desktop 9.04 and when I go to Windows XP Home the time is off by a few hours (but Ubuntu is always right).  This started immediately after installing Ubuntu.  Can anyone help me with this?  Thanks!
2009-05-02T06:21:00.000Z	goose	nedwell	do you have the correct time zone in ubuntu?
2009-05-02T06:22:00.000Z	nedwell	goose	yes EST (USA)
2009-05-02T06:22:00.000Z	goose	nedwell	that would have been my best guess was that conflicting time zones weren't syncing correctly...
