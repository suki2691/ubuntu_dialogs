2011-12-17T07:00:00.000Z	alexxander		hi. i need some help in as basic a form as possible, as i'm finding it impossible to get codecs for the linux media player. how do i get divx/xvid installed and working on 11.10?
2011-12-17T07:02:00.000Z	alexxander		honestly, i am a total linux novice and have no idea what that means, all i know is my videos wont play and gspot says they both require xvid

2011-12-17T07:05:00.000Z	scott__	alexxander	vlc is just the best video player around. it plays everything but mkv files. but i've heard tell of it playing them as well. but thats the only format i've not had success with
