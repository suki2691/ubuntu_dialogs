2009-02-12T10:54:00.000Z	carpii		i want to run lighttpd but im having problems with permissions.   It seems lighty wants to run as www-data, so it can write to /var/log/lighttpd, but then it cant read my php scripts from /home/carpii/web -- how to fix this please?

2009-02-12T10:56:00.000Z	lockd	carpii	similar thing happened here but not quite fried. shattered, completely
