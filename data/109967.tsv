2011-01-02T11:48:00.000Z	aeturnus		i have an 8.04LTS install of Ubuntu that appears to no longer be receiving updates
2011-01-02T11:48:00.000Z	aeturnus		is there something i can do to remedy that? it's my understanding that this version is still supported
2011-01-02T11:49:00.000Z	soreau	aeturnus	What package is old?
