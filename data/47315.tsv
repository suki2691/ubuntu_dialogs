2009-10-29T01:55:00.000Z	ikonia	daevski	only grub uses the grub config
2009-10-29T01:56:00.000Z	daevski	ikonia	My appologies, you're right. What I meant was a kubuntu 9.10 install vs a ubuntu 9.04 install... Can I point the bootloader to the other ones grub file? My goal is to make my previous install the primary, with modifications, incase I decide to delete the kubuntu install.
