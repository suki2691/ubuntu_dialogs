2011-01-02T08:26:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	hanasaki	I don't think there is one, if you don't want to carry, then you have to scan media, like usb sticks
2011-01-02T08:27:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	hanasaki	but the fact is I have run virii on my Linux box with wine to no avail
2011-01-02T08:28:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	hanasaki	the only thing it does is multiplies itself, and pastes itself in many folders, I later removed them, it was nothing
