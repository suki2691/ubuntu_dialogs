2008-07-31T10:35:00.000Z	chalcedny		i've got a problem setting up my netgear router. i believe the router is 255.255.255.0 and my computer (ubuntu Hardy 8.4) is looking for 255.255.255.255 ?
2008-07-31T10:35:00.000Z	chalcedny		is that something i can call tech support back for, or something i need to set in my computer(s) ?
2008-07-31T10:35:00.000Z	bderrly	chalcedny	255.255.255.0 is your netmask more than likely, not the ip of the router
2008-07-31T10:36:00.000Z	bderrly	chalcedny	the ip of the router is probably 192.168.0.1
