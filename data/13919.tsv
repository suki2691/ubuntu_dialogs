2012-07-16T18:46:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Combatjuan	what exactly are you trying to do?
2012-07-16T18:47:00.000Z	Combatjuan	Hyperbyte	Find out where /dev/eth0 went.  It used to be in /dev/net I think.
2012-07-16T18:48:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Combatjuan	I have no idea to be honest - don't see anything on my 12.04, but I also don't see why you'd need it.
