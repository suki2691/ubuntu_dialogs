2012-01-16T11:46:00.000Z	spexi		Hi! How can I set root rights for my user account permanently, or is it possible? I do "sudo su" on the command line, but if I would like to access the server for example with WinSCP and transfer files from some directory I don't have rights to, there comes warning with "Access denied". How could that be done the easiest way?
