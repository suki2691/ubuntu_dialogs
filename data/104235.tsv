2011-03-04T03:08:00.000Z	calcfreak89		does UCK (Ubuntu Customization Kit) have an IRC channel?
2011-03-04T03:09:00.000Z	calcfreak89		wow there should be a chatting irc channel for ubuntu and one for help and support since it's annoying when u need some help on something and people are chatting about random new stuff coming out
