2006-10-25T13:41:00.000Z	oleen		tomorrow i want to migrate from gentoo to ubuntu eft; keeping my /home-partition will be a walk in the park, right...?
2006-10-25T13:42:00.000Z	anon32	oleen	yes... you'll simply need to fstab your home partition to /home
2006-10-25T13:45:00.000Z	anon32	oleen	well, personally, I think gentoo is nice - especially if you like updates faster than every 6 months
2006-10-25T13:46:00.000Z	oleen	anon32	my problem with gentoo, which i have been using for a couple of years is (not unexpected) (1) compiling, which takes ages, and (2) wanting to have a bleeding edge (somewhat...) system...
