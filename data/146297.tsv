2009-10-06T08:36:00.000Z	eido		is there a difference in the driver support for 9.04 and 9.04 netbook remix?
2009-10-06T08:37:00.000Z	Biovore	eido	its all the same stuff.. just 1 package differance..
2009-10-06T08:38:00.000Z	eido	Biovore	so the problems i am having with no being able to load into x wouldnt change
2009-10-06T08:39:00.000Z	Biovore	eido	probably not..  if the live cd didn't work.. netbook release will probably be the same thing..
