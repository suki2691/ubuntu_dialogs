2008-10-22T01:33:00.000Z	WesGniel		I just installed hardy inside of windows, I have 3 gigs of ram and a 1.8 ghz system. My keyboard is very very slow in responding. My mouse responds normally and everything responds normally. I checked the keyboard settings including assessability and they appear to be set correctly I check ram and cpu usage and they are fine. What should I do to speed up my keyboard response?

2008-10-22T01:34:00.000Z	Lokian	WesGniel	i'd believe that to be your case
