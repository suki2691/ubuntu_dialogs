2007-08-17T09:49:00.000Z	cry1		can i configure WPA with networking? i only have wep-key there
2007-08-17T09:49:00.000Z	icespider69199	cry1	the only way I could do it was by enabling "roaming mode"
2007-08-17T09:50:00.000Z	icespider69199	cry1	then left-clicking on the network icon in the tray and picking the network I wanted to connect to
2007-08-17T09:51:00.000Z	cry1	icespider69199	the problem is, i can only pick a network after a reboot... then it works just fine
