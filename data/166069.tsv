I've since determined this isn't strictly true, judging from the menu commands available on a right-click. How do I set up a shortcut to do with a double-click what I previously had to do by digging out the program and selecting from a menu?

2008-01-04T08:49:00.000Z	PirateHead	macksting	right click -> create program launcher
