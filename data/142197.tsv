2007-11-01T01:34:00.000Z	anonymous_		hello, I have just installed ubuntu manualy on one of  my drives and I can't see the rest of my Hard disk drives in my computer window

2007-11-01T01:35:00.000Z	PurpZeY	anonymous_	You have to mount them and set them up to be read...I'm not sure how to do it in gutsy....but, it's supposed to be very easy I'm told
2007-11-01T01:36:00.000Z	PurpZeY	anonymous_	I believe that they should not appear until they are mounted.
