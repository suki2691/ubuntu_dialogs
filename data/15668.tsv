2011-06-23T04:19:00.000Z	Zeelot	biami	I don't know what you mean by that
2011-06-23T04:22:00.000Z	biami	Zeelot	programName a b c... argv[1]=a, right??? Then if argv[1] is there, then do something like firstArg=argv[1] else firstArg=default
2011-06-23T04:22:00.000Z	Zeelot	biami	yea that's unrelated to what I needed, but thanks
