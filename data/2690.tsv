2012-06-03T03:39:00.000Z	GreekFreak		I'm using a very old laptop, and I wanted to change the desktop environment. However I wanted to ask how does Ubuntu server compare? What desktop env does it use, and how heavy is it?
2012-06-03T03:40:00.000Z	GeekAdmin	GreekFreak	 Yea server is all textual. I recommend you try gnome classic or xfce  t
2012-06-03T03:41:00.000Z	GeekAdmin	GreekFreak	 sudo apt-get install gnome-shell xubuntu-desktop
