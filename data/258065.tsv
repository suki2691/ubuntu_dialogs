2004-11-14T12:57:00.000Z	epod		The other day someone sent me to an ubuntulinux.org page that not only showed how to install the ndiswrapper, but how to save the settings for it.  Can anyone refer me to that url?
2004-11-14T12:57:00.000Z	someone	epod	i thought ubuntu came with ndiswrapper
2004-11-14T12:58:00.000Z	epod	someone	well, you have to download it, but there was a way to save my settings so it automatically came up on boot-up
2004-11-14T12:58:00.000Z	someone	epod	try modprobe ndiswrapper
