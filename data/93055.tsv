2008-04-28T03:21:00.000Z	gregorovius__		Hi... does anybody know how is Ubuntu/gnome starting compiz when I enable desktop effects? what does it execute and from where?
2008-04-28T03:22:00.000Z	gregorovius__		because if I add compiz --replace to gnome, there's a visible transition when it's started... in ubuntu it's smoother
