2007-06-02T05:15:00.000Z	gioele		are debian-multimedia .deb packages compatible with feisty?
2007-06-02T05:16:00.000Z	Gnea	gioele	it's not a good idea to mix debian .debs with ubuntu and vice versa, since they were not specifically designed for each other - the only thing they share is the package management system
2007-06-02T05:17:00.000Z	gioele	Gnea	I know... anybody know where I can find lame 3.97 for Feisty?
