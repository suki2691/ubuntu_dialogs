2008-07-11T05:31:00.000Z	Barracuda		Hi guys. I am trying to install package /pkcs11-helper and do a "sudo ./configure" in this package but I get this error  "error: OpenSSL enabled but cannot be found". Any one know how to fix this problem???
2008-07-11T05:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	Barracuda	Are you sure pkcs11-helper isn't in the repositories?
2008-07-11T05:33:00.000Z	Barracuda	Stormx2	no I cant't find it in the repositories
2008-07-11T05:36:00.000Z	Barracuda	Stormx2	libssl-dev is actually already installed
