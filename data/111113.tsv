2007-12-02T16:43:00.000Z	Sorcererbob1	s_	there has been ongoing issues with some recent toshiba models. I couldn' t get it working on a P200 recently
2007-12-02T16:44:00.000Z	Sorcererbob1	s_	its because some of the chips are built into each other - I'm fairly sure the modem and audio card are on the same chip thing, and I know in windows you have to install the drivers in a particular order to make it work... can't help beyond that though
