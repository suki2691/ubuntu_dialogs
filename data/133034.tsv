2007-05-27T08:57:00.000Z	J-_		  is there a way to get the printer to print a PDF from the last page I left off? there's, "all, current, range" as options, I've tried current, and not sure what I should input for range... I want to start where I left off.
2007-05-27T08:58:00.000Z	ejack_	J-_	what do you mean..."left off"?
2007-05-27T08:59:00.000Z	J-_	ejack_	I stopped printing at a page, say 86. I want to go from 87 and so forth.
2007-05-27T09:01:00.000Z	ejack_	J-_	I don't think that it is possible to do that. Never really looked into it all that much though.
