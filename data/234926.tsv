2005-06-12T11:19:00.000Z	apollo2011		How do I get the apache server working on ubuntu? I installed it but nothing I put in /var/www will load except what is in the apache-default dir.
2005-06-12T11:19:00.000Z	JDahl	apollo2011	regular HTML pages even?
2005-06-12T11:20:00.000Z	apollo2011	JDahl	Yep I added an html page and it won't load.  It says it can't find it and tries to download a blank file
2005-07-12T15:47:00.000Z	JDahl	apollo2011	do a "purge" with dpkg
