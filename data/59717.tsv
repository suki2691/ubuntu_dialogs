2010-05-25T04:20:00.000Z	dancek	gotsanity	by modifying xorg configuration (sorry, i can't tell more exaclty)
2010-05-25T04:21:00.000Z	gotsanity	dancek	thanks for the response, however the joystick isnt even listed under xorg.conf
2010-05-25T04:22:00.000Z	dancek	gotsanity	any recent xorg does some autoconfiguration on top of or instead of xorg.conf et al
