2006-06-09T12:47:00.000Z	Sir_Brizz	campfire	it doesn't see your windows drive as hdb5. Have you scanned your partition tabele to make sure that's where it really is?
2006-06-09T12:49:00.000Z	Sir_Brizz	campfire	I'm not sure. That error typically means that /dev/hdb5 is not associated with any hardware
