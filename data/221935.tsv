2005-10-16T15:53:00.000Z	Licker		i setup a web server right.  ( www.cnmafia.com ) well, it wont show the images i have there. (open it and click on a link/pic) they say you dont have permission to view them. i dont know why etc. Or what to do. I just strted using linux a bit ago and havnt learned all the commands etc yet. (got rid of crapy windows) :/
