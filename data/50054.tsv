2009-08-28T01:49:00.000Z	brennus		I'm trying to remove my gnome top panel; a link on ubuntu forums says I may be able to to it in "session options," but "session options" does not appear to be an available preference anymore (jaunty). help?

2009-08-28T01:50:00.000Z	Grifulkin	brennus	I just tried it on mine and it is also grayed out, can I ask why you want to delelte it?
2009-08-28T01:53:00.000Z	Grifulkin	brennus	I don't know than, sorry, on mine I deleted the bottom panel and moved the one from the top to the bottom and added stuff to it, you could try to hide the panel, but that is my best guess.
