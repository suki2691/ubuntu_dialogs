2005-07-14T11:05:00.000Z	nalioth_zZz	qt2	you should stick with official repos, or your system may suffer
2005-07-14T11:13:00.000Z	qt2	nalioth_zZz	so... should i compile everything not in the official repositories...
2005-07-14T11:14:00.000Z	nalioth_zZz	qt2	first try for official binarys, 2nd use apt to build from official sources 3d, build by hand (use checkinstall in place of "make install")
