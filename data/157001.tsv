2006-11-27T06:57:00.000Z	Jager		Could someone help me figure out why I can't boot into windows using grub
2006-11-27T06:58:00.000Z	P2500	Jager	What does your grub.conf file read?
2006-11-27T07:02:00.000Z	P2500	Jager	Mybad, I was being unfocused. I meant /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-11-27T07:04:00.000Z	P2500	Jager	Could you also write a little something about what your mounts are?
