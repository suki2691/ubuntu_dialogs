2008-09-30T10:06:00.000Z	lloyd		Hi, can someone tell me the command to move all the files in a folder (just the folder, not its subfolders) to another directory?  In DOS it was move *.*, but I need to command for linux.  :)
2008-09-30T10:07:00.000Z	lloyd		right
2008-09-30T10:07:00.000Z	lloyd		so it would look exactly like this...  mv * / /usr/share/gnome-screensaver
2008-09-30T10:08:00.000Z	bobertdos	lloyd	No, mv * <destination>
