2009-09-22T20:16:00.000Z	iskin		I'm using Jaunty and Flash either needs exclusive control over all audio to work. If I'm watching a file on YouTube I can't play MP3s and if I'm listening to MP3s I can't hear a flash video. Does anyone know of a fix?

2009-09-22T20:19:00.000Z	iskin	kyle6513	So if i used another browser like Opera I wouldn't experience the flash sound bug?
