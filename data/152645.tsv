2006-12-28T12:10:00.000Z	seamus7_		Hi I'm on Edgy trying to get the fglrx 8.28.8 driver working .... can someone look at my xorg.conf file at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/39120/
2006-12-28T12:11:00.000Z	Darius[TEA] 	seamus7_	the log file would be more useful
2006-12-28T12:11:00.000Z	Darius[TEA] 	seamus7_	as well as a description of what you see
2006-12-28T12:12:00.000Z	Darius[TEA] 	seamus7_	does switching to the text console work?
