2007-02-19T16:51:00.000Z	un0p	hyperactivecrond	 lsof shows you open files and the processes which have those file open -- so it's not related to netstat directly
2007-02-19T16:51:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	un0p	i read somewhere lsof has an option to show open network connections
2007-02-19T16:52:00.000Z	un0p	hyperactivecrond	 you're right, the manpage does verify that
