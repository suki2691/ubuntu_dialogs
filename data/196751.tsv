2006-03-05T17:46:00.000Z	marlun		I just installed ubuntu and for some reason I wasn't asked for keyboard language, I believe its set to an american keyboard now and I've got a swedish one. I went to Preferences > Keyboard, Layouts Tab, and removed the american layout and added the swedish one, but it didn\t help, the keys are still wrong. Any ideas?
