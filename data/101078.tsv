2008-02-09T00:12:00.000Z	Dante		Does anybody know how I make ubuntu write two lines in root at startup?
2008-02-09T00:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dante	Can you explain that a bit more.
2008-02-09T00:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dante	YOu can write a script and put it in startup... but there must be a better way to do what you are trying to accomplish
2008-02-09T00:21:00.000Z	Dante	Jack_Sparrow	How should that script look and how do I make it start at startup? What im trying to do is make ubuntu "write" those two lines in root so I dont have to do it in a terminal every time I turn on the computer.
