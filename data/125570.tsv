2007-10-27T22:03:00.000Z	timbobsteve	ganeshhegde	should be able to download the .bin file from limewire to com... if you are using ubuntu you can just install the free version called "frostwire".... it is better and no adds/restrictions.... sudo apt-get install frostwire
2007-10-27T22:04:00.000Z	timbobsteve	ganeshhegde	go to www.frostwire.org and download the installer from there.... please don't get limewire... it's not worth the hassle
2007-10-27T22:23:00.000Z	timbobsteve	ganeshhegde	not sure.... java might come under mutliverse or universe... or even restricted.... I enabled all of them from the get-go so I don't know which is which :P I prefer to have ll the options
