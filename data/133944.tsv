I've tried installing the binaries from Nvidia's site, but they wont install (says x is running, so I reboot in terminal and then it asks me to be in run lvl 3, which brings me back to x)
2007-05-28T14:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	irishman2020	'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop' to install nvidia.com *run package
2007-05-28T14:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	irishman2020	but the packages from the repo shouldn't crash X
2007-05-28T14:09:00.000Z	irishman2020	erUSUL	the repo package crashes x every time
