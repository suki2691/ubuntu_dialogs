2008-04-16T07:07:00.000Z	Zackymc_k		i was able to until last week then... no turn off
2008-04-16T07:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Zackymc_k	did you have any unofficial repos prior to an update?
2008-04-16T07:12:00.000Z	Zackymc_k	Jack_Sparrow	I ran updates right after i installed ubuntu 7.10... fresh install with nothing else then a wep key
