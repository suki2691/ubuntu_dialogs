2007-12-14T18:34:00.000Z	yonilevy		i'm looking for a tool that allows extracting data out of a faulty cd/dvd (i can't mount [it get stuck], although in windows i -can- view the contents of the dvd [i can't fully read them though])
2007-12-14T18:35:00.000Z	yonilevy		ideas?
2007-12-14T18:36:00.000Z	shearn89	yonilevy	you could try (in windows) creating an iso, and then mounting that?
2007-12-14T18:36:00.000Z	yonilevy	shearn89	the disc is faulty [parts of it are not readable], i don't know any windows application that could generate a "partial" iso...
