2009-04-07T00:03:00.000Z	mcmillen		any suggestions for what i should use to get ubuntu on an eeepc? there seems to be a wide variety of options, from stock ubuntu + array.org kernel, or "easypeasy", or Ubuntu Netbook Remix (but does this support all the eeepc 901 hardware out of the box?)

2009-04-07T00:03:00.000Z	jamalfanaian	mcmillen	I've used USB before but using TFTP for a net install
2009-04-07T00:03:00.000Z	mcmillen	jamalfanaian	i'm fine with using USB or netinstall, i'm mostly interested in *which* flavor i should choose, since stock doesn't seem to work with all the hardware and there are 3 or 4 ways of going about it
