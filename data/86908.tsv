2008-07-03T23:24:00.000Z	Naisenu		I have an NTFS formatted hard-drive that mounts and I have read access, but I can't write. My husband's account is able to write to it. I have the ntfs  read/write package installed. Not sure why I don't have access to write.

2008-07-03T23:25:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	Naisenu	OK
