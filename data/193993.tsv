2007-02-05T17:13:00.000Z	mojo_		[Elsa] : you might want to read up on BASH (the terminal in ubuntu) before getting too deep with commands.  If you want to delete stuff you'd be better off knowing the syntax and what you are doing a little better
2007-02-05T17:14:00.000Z	zzz	mojo_	Bash is not a terminal. It is a shell.
2007-02-05T17:14:00.000Z	mojo_		[Elsa] : be careful with su or sudo commands... they mean super-user or super-user-do  ... i.e. running commands with ROOT priviledges can seriously mess stuff up if you delete the wrong things.
2007-02-05T17:15:00.000Z	mojo_	zzz	you are right, technically.  but still [Elsa]  should read a BASH manual
