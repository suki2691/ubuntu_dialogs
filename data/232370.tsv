2009-07-15T15:14:00.000Z	Blindblade		Ah i see thanks.
2009-07-15T15:15:00.000Z	Blindblade		Well, I've installed ubuntu then vista.. all that has happened.. and i dont know how to figure out where the vista partition is on my drive so I can add it to the grub. I remember doing it off a live cd with some utility though having problems with my dvd drive at the moment.
