2009-03-17T21:48:00.000Z	akazawa		hello, I am having an issue with playing games. When I go in games they say my IP is 127.12.34.56 and when I go into the terminal I can ping 127.12.34.56 and ssh to it and it shows up as the computer I am using, however my IP is 192.168.2.3. What is going on? How can I make it resolve to the correct ip?
2009-03-17T21:49:00.000Z	syockit	akazawa	but does it work using your 192 ip?
2009-03-17T21:53:00.000Z	syockit	akazawa	but since you get to ssh it, it's not specific to the game, correct? maybe some avahi thing got it up...
2009-03-17T21:54:00.000Z	akazawa	syockit	yeah, I was thinking something like that
