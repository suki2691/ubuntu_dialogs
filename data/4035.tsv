2012-04-12T16:29:00.000Z	fidel	Guest79298	as you are asking that in multiple channels - it is possible in MS excel and most likely as well in libre/oo. but i cant tell you how ;)
2012-04-12T16:31:00.000Z	fidel	Guest79298	regarding libre -> consider asking in the matching channel: #libreoffice
2012-04-12T16:31:00.000Z	Guest79298	fidel	well i was just curious it would be nice for something i am doing right now in libre office
