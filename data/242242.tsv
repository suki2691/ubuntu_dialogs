2005-06-29T06:58:00.000Z	linlin_		Hey I have some questions about ubuntu, partitions, and dual booting.
2005-06-29T06:59:00.000Z	linlin_		I have ubuntu installed, running great, I resized the partition with parted, theres room for ubuntu and win2000 now, Now my question is if i load windows 2000 with ubuntu loaded right now, will it mess up the bootloader?
2005-06-29T07:00:00.000Z	linlin_		And, if it does, how would I go about reloading grub
2005-06-29T07:00:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	linlin_	yes
