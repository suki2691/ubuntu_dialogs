2007-02-09T15:47:00.000Z	|Jason8|		Hey guys, is it a bad idea to upgrade from Breezy to Edgy without upgrading to Dapper?
2007-02-09T15:48:00.000Z	alecjw	|Jason8|	yep. never skiop a release. upgrade to dapper, thjen to edgy. or oyu can reinstall
2007-02-09T15:48:00.000Z	alecjw	|Jason8|	i assume that you know that reinstallign will lose all of your data and installed programs?
2007-02-09T15:50:00.000Z	|Jason8|	alecjw	yeah.  I just started playing with ubuntu about two weeks ago, so no major losses :p
