2008-11-13T06:00:00.000Z	peary	panfist	you are both talking about different meanings for "page size"
2008-11-13T06:01:00.000Z	panfist	peary	well what other page size would require me to recompile the kernel
2008-11-13T06:02:00.000Z	peary	panfist	fryguy was referring to the page or swap file, which does not really have anything to do with the kernel
