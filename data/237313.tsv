2005-05-19T13:17:00.000Z	R0bNyc		 I've tried to install Kubuntu and Ubuntu and I get this error. I choose reiserfs anyways.. Copying Packages Failed.. Copying packages to the harddisk failed. You may have run out of disk space in the targer /var filesystem.     Check /var/log/syslog or see virtual console 4 for the details can aonyone help me

2005-05-19T13:20:00.000Z	agent	R0bNyc	or you can try to resize the partition if you know how
2005-05-19T13:20:00.000Z	R0bNyc	agent	9.7gb is way to install ?
