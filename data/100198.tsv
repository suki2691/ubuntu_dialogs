2008-02-16T22:05:00.000Z	krim		I have an album in FLAC. I want to get a list of the title of all songs, how do I do that?
2008-02-16T22:06:00.000Z	brad01	krim	Maybe if you import it into a media player?
2008-02-16T22:07:00.000Z	krim	brad01	Which media player would let me copy the tags of several songs at once? Rhythmbox doesn't seem to be able to do it.
2008-02-16T22:07:00.000Z	krim	brad01	I could do ls and export output to text file but then I won't get special characters that couldn't be in the filename.
