2008-04-26T00:39:00.000Z	MountainX		I need a link to an HP printer howto for noobs. Ubuntu forums are not working for me today. Can't find an up to date doc in the wiki either.

2008-04-26T00:39:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	MountainX	what printer do you have?
2008-04-26T00:44:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	MountainX	sorry, I don't know too much about setting up network printers
