2009-06-26T08:59:00.000Z	GreenSimian		Hey there, I have a NTFS USB drive and I want to back it up before I format it and use it for a Ubuntu client.  Is there a good NIX disk imager that will create a file image of the drive?
2009-06-26T08:59:00.000Z	GreenSimian		Or am I going about this the wrong way?
2009-06-26T09:01:00.000Z	GreenSimian		Ian, I am not sure that I could handle having a 120GB Zip File and restore it.  I would prefer to find a partion imager...that way I can retain all that NTFS Stream Mojo that Windwos Loves to use.
