2012-01-19T08:30:00.000Z	Ben64	bradleyayers	why are you installing like that instead of using a repository
2012-01-19T08:30:00.000Z	bradleyayers	Ben64	just playing around with installing packages from newer versions, it'll probably break things but im just experimenting
2012-01-19T08:31:00.000Z	Ben64	bradleyayers	it definitely will break things, don't do it : /
