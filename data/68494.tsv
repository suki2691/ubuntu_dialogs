2009-01-25T01:59:00.000Z	aLeSD		is it possible to install a kernel of the 8.04 on the 8.10 ?

2009-01-25T02:00:00.000Z	aLeSD	wassy121_	ok
2009-01-25T02:00:00.000Z	wassy121_	aLeSD	A better solution would be to figure out what is broken/different between the two, and fix the 8.10 kernel to work the same as the older kernel from 8.04.
