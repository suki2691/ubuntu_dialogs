2006-06-18T10:11:00.000Z	Unintentional		hey, does anyone know if there's a graphical equivalent of rsh/ssh?  I basically want to log into a gnome environment remotely
2006-06-18T10:12:00.000Z	Unintentional		no idea?
2006-06-18T10:12:00.000Z	Unintentional		problem with VNC is that it requires the person be logged in already
