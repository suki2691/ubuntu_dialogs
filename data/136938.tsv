2007-10-14T13:53:00.000Z	tgm4883		is there a channel for ubuntu wiki help or should I ask in here?  I'm trying to get a picture to link

2007-10-14T13:54:00.000Z	tgm4883	astro76	the image is on there.  What I want is someone to be able to click on the picture and have them linked somewhere
2007-10-14T13:55:00.000Z	astro76	tgm4883	can't do that, MoinMoin isn't very full featured
