2006-03-03T16:14:00.000Z	Scott31337		how can I set it to a generic vesa driver and try that way
2006-03-03T16:14:00.000Z	adam_	Scott31337	in your xorg.conf / xfree86 file set driver = vesa
2006-03-03T16:17:00.000Z	adam_	Scott31337	edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf under "Device"  change Driver "whaterver Prob ATI" to Driver "vesa"
