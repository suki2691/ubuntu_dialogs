2005-04-03T16:10:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm		opera isn't really in the spirit of kde since its a closed-source, pay-for piece of software...but it is a qt app
2005-04-03T16:10:00.000Z	maxchee	Quinn_Storm	but the cluttered interface and infinite configuration certainly make it more kde like (no offence to kde people)
2005-04-03T16:11:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	maxchee	well I am a kde person...while the interface doesn't seem cluttered to me (gnome's seems sparse and clunky), I do prefer the configurability
