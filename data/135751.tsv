2007-08-01T05:37:00.000Z	chenchen		I would like to replace a whole paragraph in many files to another new paragragh, what tool i can use that in ubuntu?
2007-08-01T05:38:00.000Z	Slart	chenchen	grep perhaps.. might take a look at awk..
2007-08-01T05:40:00.000Z	chenchen	Slart	: grep only for single line?
2007-08-01T05:41:00.000Z	Slart	chenchen	nah. I think grep might work for multiple lines... but you'll have to read some man-pages, I'm not sure
