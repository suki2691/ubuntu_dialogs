2009-04-24T21:08:00.000Z	snipd		i upgraded to 9.04 server, but when i turned on my machine, GRUB says "gave up waiting for root device". in the grub menu, i have 4 options. 2.6.27-11 and 2.6.27-7, each with a (recovery mode). since GRUB was trying the -11 boot, i chose the -7 boot, and now my system started, but without any internet. !

2009-04-24T21:12:00.000Z	snipd	vart	the 8.10 release notes did mention that grub error, but it was because of specific dell motherboards. that and i already tried their suggestion anyway :)
2009-04-24T21:12:00.000Z	vart	snipd	I mean 9.04 RN it was something about intel motherboards
