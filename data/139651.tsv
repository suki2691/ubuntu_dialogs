2007-04-18T13:56:00.000Z	Seraphire		Question then:  I have someone that's trying dictionary attacks against my Ubuntu box.  Is there a way I can configure SSH so that it not let someone continue to try and log into my box after a certain number of failures?

2007-04-18T13:57:00.000Z	WaxyFresh	Seraphire	or turn off ssh
2007-04-18T13:57:00.000Z	Seraphire	WaxyFresh	I need SSH open as we don't all have console access.
