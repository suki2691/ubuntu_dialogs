2009-03-22T20:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlad50	i'd look at grub to make sure its setup ok and then troubleshoot windows
2009-03-22T20:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlad50	i'd also fsck the drives and checkdisk in windows
2009-03-22T20:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlad50	run an fsck on your disks to make sure they are ok
