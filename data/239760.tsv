2005-04-25T08:46:00.000Z	D_F	chad	I have no idea why it will not work!
2005-04-25T08:46:00.000Z	D_F	chad	All I did was install it, but when I run "TeamSpeak", it just will not start!
2005-04-25T08:48:00.000Z	D_F	chad	What did you do when you installed TeamSpeak? I just cannot make it work for some reason :S
