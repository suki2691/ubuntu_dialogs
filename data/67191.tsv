2011-12-01T15:42:00.000Z	zagabar		I am programming an application that sends udp data over a specific port. I want to monitor this to make sure it is really sent. Is there a nice way I can monitor the eth0 for udp packages over a certain port?
2011-12-01T15:44:00.000Z	llutz	zagabar	tcpdump (also catches udp)
2011-12-01T15:45:00.000Z	zagabar	llutz	Hmm tried that one. But didn't get any traffic. "tcpdump 'udp port 9999'" Would be correct? In that case I guess my application fails.
2011-12-01T15:47:00.000Z	llutz	zagabar	check your app then
