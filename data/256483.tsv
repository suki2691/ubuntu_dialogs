2008-10-18T14:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	kane77	 why do you need to tripple boot that> whats so special about ubuntu studio? Basicially you manually make a grub entry to boot the other disrtos
2008-10-18T14:32:00.000Z	kane77	nireh	dr_willis I thought it was more than that (eg using different kernel etc.) if it is just ubuntu + apps then there is no need to install it
2008-10-18T14:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	kane77	 no idea. I noticed they had 8.10 releases of kiubuntu, ubuntu, ubuntu studio (i think)   so im thinking its just packages.
