2011-09-19T14:03:00.000Z	AttaBOY		Can I make a cronjob using sudo crontab +e that opens a gnome-terminal? Then runs shutdown 10. I want this to display the shutdown message in the recently open gnome-terminal. Since the users probably don't have a terminal open they would not see the shutdown message unless I do it like this?

2011-09-19T14:04:00.000Z	ikonia	AttaBOY	easier to look at gtk message popup tools,
