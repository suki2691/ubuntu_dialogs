2008-01-26T11:21:00.000Z	jiggy		Gutsy has suddenly decided to start freezing up on me, and clue about how I should troubleshoot this?
2008-01-26T11:23:00.000Z	jiggy		Iceman:  I already took a gander through my logs, but nothing odd really popped out at me
2008-01-26T11:24:00.000Z	jiggy		should I try a forum post?  Someone else would probably be able to spot the issue
2008-01-26T11:24:00.000Z	mouseboyx	jiggy	 is it random freezing?
