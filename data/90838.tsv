2012-07-08T22:57:00.000Z	MacGuges		Hello, I need to fix a broken dependency on my dad's pc, before downgrading him from quantal back to precise.  apt-get -f install says that netbase breaks ifupdown, so would it be safe to remove ifupdown temporarily to correct this dependency?

2012-07-08T23:00:00.000Z	MacGuges	Myrtti	How do you mean? I found a howto for downgrading, and just tested a script to generate a command for apt-get. ATM it fails on the same error that motivates me to do the downgrade, this one broken dependency.
