2005-10-18T06:15:00.000Z	Danoman		Are there any different between yesterdays 5.10 rc and the released 5.10 ?
2005-10-18T06:16:00.000Z	apokryphos	Danoman	yes
2005-10-18T06:16:00.000Z	apokryphos	Danoman	the RC is the release candidate released some time ago; the ones now are the shiny new Breezy ISOs
