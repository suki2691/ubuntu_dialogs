2008-04-06T03:01:00.000Z	omar		Is there a way I can log on as root outside the terminal?
2008-04-06T03:03:00.000Z	Starnestommy	omar	in a terminal, cd ~/.Trash then sudo rm filename
2008-04-06T03:11:00.000Z	Starnestommy	omar	there's nothing in there.  the . is a link to the current directory and the .. is a link to the one above
2008-04-06T03:11:00.000Z	omar	Starnestommy	I do know that already man. :)
