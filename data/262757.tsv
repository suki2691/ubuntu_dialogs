2004-10-21T05:16:00.000Z	AndersAA	menator	that module is video for linux, it shouldn't be something critical
2004-10-21T05:18:00.000Z	menator	AndersAA	Why would X be using it?
2004-10-21T05:18:00.000Z	AndersAA	menator	it could be it's just trying to load it, and failing that, so it's not the critical error
