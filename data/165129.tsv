2006-10-08T12:12:00.000Z	Za1		Hi, can someone pls give me some suggestions - I have currently running Ubuntu (hoary) and I would like to upgrade to latest (drapper) which I have a CD.  Is there anyway I can only do upgrade without lossing my existing data?
2006-10-08T12:13:00.000Z	Za1		okay - the problem is i only have 64k.  That mean I need to order breezy CD and upgrade first?
2006-10-08T12:14:00.000Z	Za1		hmm- sounds like i better backup and nuke my machine and install the latest will be the best solutions.  thanks guys for your wonderful feeback.  you bunch are always a helpful.
