2009-05-04T19:04:00.000Z	J_A_X		can anyone please help. I just upgraded my laptop to jaunty and now I can't connect to any wireless using knetworkmanager
2009-05-04T19:04:00.000Z	J_A_X		says that my wireless is disconnected
2009-05-04T19:05:00.000Z	J_A_X		even though drivers seems to be fine
2009-05-04T19:05:00.000Z	histo	J_A_X	do you have a button to disable an enable wireless on your laptop?
