2008-05-17T15:39:00.000Z	Aleksander-pl		Hello. I am trying to connect my Samsung YP-K3 to my Ubuntu Linux and copy files there with AmaroK. I have installed libmtp7, but AmaroK doesn't detect it automatically. When I run dcop kded mediamanager fullList it gives me some errors, such as DCOPClient::attachInternal. Attach failed Could not open network socket ERROR: Couldn't attach to DCOP server! - what can I do?

2008-05-17T15:39:00.000Z	Aleksander-pl	kahrytan	how to check it?
