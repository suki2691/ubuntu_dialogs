2006-04-10T08:57:00.000Z	thegve		Hi ya'll. Just installed Ubuntu Dapper and had a few problems. After installing, it didn't boot. The directory /boot didn't exist. Created the directory and made a symlink in it to /grub and everything works again. After apt-getting smbfs there is one bad formatted commentline starting with +####Domain. Removed the + and it works again.
