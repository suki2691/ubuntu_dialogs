Is there any way to get this library without installing driver xorg-driver-fglrx?? I dont know what driver Iam now using, but I know it works better on my laptop than xorg-driver-fglrx... ubuntu 8.04

2010-03-01T00:29:00.000Z	joshuaBoshi	MalfermitaKodo	hehe, thanks :-) my fellow solved that problem by installing that fglrx package. Iam trying to find other package that would contain libGL.so.1.2
