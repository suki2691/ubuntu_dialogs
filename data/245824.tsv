2008-04-24T22:54:00.000Z	TerryYaki		My network monitor says I'm constantly downloading something even when I have nothing running. It's going on 3 gigs now, and I can't figure out what's going on. Could there be another reason for it?
2008-04-24T22:55:00.000Z	TerryYaki		I'm not knowingly downloading anything.
2008-04-24T22:55:00.000Z	pierce	TerryYaki	maybe it's your package updates?
2008-04-24T22:56:00.000Z	pierce	TerryYaki	I have mine to download packages in the background, then install when I say so
