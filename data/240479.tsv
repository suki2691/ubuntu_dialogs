2007-09-09T11:18:00.000Z	Tiradin		I tried installing Ubuntu Studio on an IBM Thinkpad T23. It was going fine until the "Select and install packages" stage. It failed to complete that step, and afterwards wasn't able to install either bootloader (GRUB or LILO). It basically made the entire installation null.
