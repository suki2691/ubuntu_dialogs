2010-02-17T20:58:00.000Z	finiras2		i deleted some files while using nautilus in root (sudo nautilus) and apparently they weren't deleted from the disk that way because the free space didn't increase, but when i try to go to the root trash it gives me an error "operation not supported" so i cant delete it
2010-02-17T21:00:00.000Z	finiras2		what program do i use to extract img files in ubuntu
2010-02-17T21:01:00.000Z	genii	finiras2	Are they .img files created with dd or Mac img files?
2010-02-17T21:02:00.000Z	genii	finiras2	Sounds like ISO images of a CD or so
