2009-09-16T16:35:00.000Z	kazon_		hey! i fixed the DISPLAY ISSUE :D if anyone is having trouble with odd screensizes i may be able to help. I also have another question -- i disabled my wireless adapter to make sure i was using my cable but when i re-enabled it the network connection isn't present? i hope i don't have to add all the wireless net details as i don't know if i have them? is there another way?

2009-09-16T16:36:00.000Z	kazon_		if you disable a wireless driver and re-enable it it wipes the connection details is it possible to restore them?
