2007-02-08T11:16:00.000Z	TexJoachim		I believe I'm not the only one with held back packages, right?=
2007-02-08T11:16:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	TexJoachim	-  right.
2007-02-08T11:17:00.000Z	TexJoachim	Nutubuntu	and when will this be corrected?
2007-02-08T11:18:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	TexJoachim	- I don't think anyone's sure. Seems to be a server-side package management issue. My guess? (Totally uninformed guess): sometime today
