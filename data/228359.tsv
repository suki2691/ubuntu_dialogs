2005-07-14T10:39:00.000Z	The_Vox	Ninwa	I use kopete...what's wrong with it?
2005-07-14T10:39:00.000Z	Ninwa	The_Vox	Nothing I suppose. IceDC571, XChat and Gaim of course!
2005-07-14T10:40:00.000Z	The_Vox	Ninwa	gaim looks ugly on kde and there's nothing practical that it has that kopete doesn't have, at least in what I use/need
