2010-11-05T07:18:00.000Z	tibman		Installed grub on windows 7 partition inadvertently, grub will load linux but when I try to load windows 7, it says "error fylesystem not found". While in linux I can open my windows partition, so the files are still intact. I also tried the windows 7 install disk startup repair multiple times, no dice. Anyone have any idea?
2010-11-05T07:19:00.000Z	tibman		yep...

2010-11-05T07:21:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tibman	ummmm, sorry can't help then.  good luck.
