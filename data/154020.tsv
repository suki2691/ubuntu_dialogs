2006-12-21T10:22:00.000Z	kibbled_bits		well I'm tired of upgrading it
2006-12-21T10:22:00.000Z	kibbled_bits		I've tried Tomboy and I don't like it
2006-12-21T10:22:00.000Z	un_operateur	kibbled_bits	search for all the mono packages and uninstall them :) how hard is that -- aptitude search mono | awk '{print $2}'
