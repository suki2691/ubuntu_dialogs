2010-06-24T21:51:00.000Z	elyob		Hi, I already have $USER and $HOSTNAME which I send in a shell command. Just wondering what else is available to me, ideally looking for users IP address ...

2010-06-24T21:53:00.000Z	elyob	jmburgess	am looking for their remote IP address ... i.e. the info that you get when you do "last username"
2010-06-24T21:53:00.000Z	jmburgess	elyob	thats a little tougher
