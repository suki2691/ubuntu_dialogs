2007-02-02T11:25:00.000Z	sess		I have an amd turion 64 laptop which Im going to be using primarily for Graphics design (2D and 3D), some web design, some psp development, and maybe a little gameplaying.  I was wondering if there is ANY benefit to installing x64 Ubuntu, or if I should stick with teh x86 version.  Im already aware of the much smaller apt tree (can't I just use apt-source to build the source of any app not precompiled though?) and maybe a few driver issues.
