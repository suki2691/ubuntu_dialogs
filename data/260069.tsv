2005-04-03T15:42:00.000Z	black_Nightmare		ok just one question before I start yanking cards around (ROFL....me funny) = recoken it wouldn't be difficult to use an ati all-in-wonder radeon 7500 for vga, tv viewing, and to record video to the hd even if I need seperate software for some of the functions?
2005-04-03T15:42:00.000Z	black_Nightmare		its an agp 64mb sdram card
2005-04-03T15:43:00.000Z	geppy	black_Nightmare	That'd be really easy on windows.
2005-04-03T15:44:00.000Z	geppy	black_Nightmare	 I don't know, but my friends have never gotten their ATI cards to work properly.
