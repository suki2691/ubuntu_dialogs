2005-09-28T07:36:00.000Z	sonojacker	crimsun	Do you know about anyone succesfully patching Breezy kernel with preemption (Ingo Molnar's patches)?
2005-09-28T07:37:00.000Z	crimsun	sonojacker	I don't know of anyone who has successfully applied them to Breezy's source
2005-09-28T07:37:00.000Z	crimsun	sonojacker	there are quite a few hundred rejects
2005-09-28T07:40:00.000Z	sonojacker	crimsun	few hudnred rejects? I read about a brasilian team having achieved 32 bits hoary kernels with preemption.
