2005-09-20T12:09:00.000Z	mindmedic	SpudULike	there is also a way to override your ns in dhcp3.conf
2005-09-20T12:10:00.000Z	mindmedic	SpudULike	add this line to your network interface in /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
2005-09-20T12:13:00.000Z	mindmedic	SpudULike	yes, after the "request" line for your network interface
