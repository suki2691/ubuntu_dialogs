2006-10-07T07:02:00.000Z	thill2708		true, true, but are there programs and other certain functionality you're missing out on by using kde instead of gnome? Aren't most of the programs written for ubuntu for gnome?
2006-10-07T07:02:00.000Z	thill2708		nmapplet, for example
2006-10-07T07:03:00.000Z	wicked_Zzzz	thill2708	i use k3b in gnome...
