2007-06-05T05:59:00.000Z	bs		how can i install the kernel sources for my current kernel? i need to built a kernel module
2007-06-05T05:59:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bs	sudo apt-get install kernel-source
2007-06-05T05:59:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bs	just build-essential though is enough - you don't need the kernel source
