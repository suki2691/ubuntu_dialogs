2009-06-05T04:30:00.000Z	StevensUbuntuTri		 Hello.  Is it possible to get help with my firefox.  It will not play flash movies on the internet
2009-06-05T04:31:00.000Z	StevensUbuntuTri		I installed flash.  It used to work, but no longer.  I am not sure what I did to make it not work
2009-06-05T04:31:00.000Z	StevensUbuntuTri		I reinstalled flash several times
2009-06-05T04:31:00.000Z	MohammadAG	StevensUbuntuTri	is the plugin enabled in Firefox?
