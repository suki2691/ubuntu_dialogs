2009-10-22T09:43:00.000Z	tck9		i have a sata hdd that isn't detected in the bios. when i use a linux livecd i can see it listed with fdisk -l .. any ideas what could be wrong?
2009-10-22T09:43:00.000Z	tck9		since it doesn't show up in the bios, i can't select it as a boot device.
2009-10-22T09:45:00.000Z	tck9		it's a 250gb hdd.. another server which has the exact same mobo/bios detects it fine
2009-10-22T09:47:00.000Z	Shakti418	tck9	check the bios versions on each and download any firmware updates
