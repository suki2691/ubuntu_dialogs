2008-08-05T22:01:00.000Z	lesergi		I have Ubuntu and "Normal" visual effects activated, but when I want to play a game, I must deactivate effects, is there other option???
2008-08-05T22:02:00.000Z	Asterix_	lesergi	I have that problem too and my solution was just disable all the visuals all the time :(
2008-08-05T22:02:00.000Z	lesergi	Asterix_	i'm doing that now :(
