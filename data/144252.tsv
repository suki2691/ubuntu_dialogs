2007-03-01T14:26:00.000Z	Lukz		Hi, I can't seem to install Ubuntu properly - I've tried a number of different Live CD's but each time it keeps getting stuck on step 3/6 of installation. Can anyone pls help me??

2007-03-01T14:31:00.000Z	Lukz	ljlolel	Step 3 is where it's asking you to choose the keyboard layout
2007-03-01T14:33:00.000Z	Lukz	ljlolel	It just won't move on past that screen - I can cancel it and start again, but the same thing happens.
