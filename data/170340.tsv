2010-05-06T06:28:00.000Z	Dark_Wolf		How do I get a command to work without a path prepended? I tried putting the script in /bin, but it still can't find it.
2010-05-06T06:28:00.000Z	Dark_Wolf		Apparently the system is looking for the script in my home directory
2010-05-06T06:28:00.000Z	Plugh	Dark_Wolf	Did you mark the script as executable?
2010-05-06T06:28:00.000Z	Dark_Wolf	Plugh	Yeah
