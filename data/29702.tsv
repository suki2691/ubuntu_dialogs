2010-07-12T02:45:00.000Z	rblst		i have done a fresh install of 10.04 with existing home directory; in thunderbird 3, i have two folders of my two email accounts at the bottom of the folder list that are empty and thus useless to me, but i can't remove them

2010-07-12T02:49:00.000Z	rblst	slidinghorn	also, i do not want to remove any of the accounts, only these empty folders
