2010-03-19T18:23:00.000Z	aurilliance		I'm trying to get android sdk running on ubuntu - It needs the JDK, so I downloaded the file "jdk-6u18-linux-i586-rpm.bin" from sun, but I don't know what to do with it...
2010-03-19T18:23:00.000Z	aurilliance		Where do you place .bin files so they are 'installed'?
2010-03-19T18:23:00.000Z	aurilliance		or how can I get the JDK through apt?
