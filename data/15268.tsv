2012-03-04T23:47:00.000Z	ArcherNX01		I would love to switch Ubuntu completely, but if i could find a program that allows me to stream my desktop to twitch.tv or there would be drivers for my Avermedia HD capture card
2012-03-04T23:49:00.000Z	ArcherNX01		I tried the newest Ubuntu and i didn't like it
