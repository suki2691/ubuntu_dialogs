2010-07-17T17:41:00.000Z	mgolisch	MegaHerz	yeah the generic is the std desktop kernel
2010-07-17T17:41:00.000Z	mgolisch	MegaHerz	it should have been installed by default
2010-07-17T17:42:00.000Z	MegaHerz	mgolisch	yeah, it was installed, but then, judging from name of course, I thought 386 is more specific and installed it :)
