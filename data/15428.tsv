2012-05-02T00:11:00.000Z	Muttley_		hi. anyone knows when linux kernel 3.4 will be released? obviously it will depend on the stability etc but, do you have a forecast?
2012-05-02T00:11:00.000Z	escott	Muttley_	for ubuntu not until 12.10
2012-05-02T00:12:00.000Z	Muttley_	escott	i am referring to the kernel itself, not ubuntu in particular
2012-05-02T00:12:00.000Z	escott	Muttley_	which is offtopic here
