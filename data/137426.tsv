2008-05-04T14:48:00.000Z	AprilHare		i am running ubuntu. became curious at what temp everything was running at. my geforce 8400 gs is reporting 71 degrees celsius. is this possible? it's still working.
2008-05-04T14:50:00.000Z	AprilHare		it doesn't seem right. it would be toast at 71 deg celsius, wouldn't it?
2008-05-04T14:50:00.000Z	AprilHare		could the sensor be misreporting under linux?
