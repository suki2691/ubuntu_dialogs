2008-11-03T12:34:00.000Z	BiosElement		I'm trying to get my Mic to work with Pulseaudio and I can't even get it to show activity. I think something alsa related is messing and muting the mic input. Any ideas? Screenshots: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=6092588
2008-11-03T12:36:00.000Z	frybye	BiosElement	have you run alsamixer and checked foe muting and 0-levels etc??
2008-11-03T12:37:00.000Z	BiosElement	frybye	Yeah. The link had some screenshots for the alsamixer levels. I suspect that (somehow) alsamixer is muting things anyway even though it's set not to. Not really sure.
