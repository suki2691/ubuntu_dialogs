2008-05-02T16:00:00.000Z	papat		I cannot get icons seen in my Desktop, in kubuntu hardy, though I've activated the "see icons option". Any ideas?
2008-05-02T16:00:00.000Z	mahadasda	papat	- did u enable the advanced desktop effekt things? if u enable the option to have different backgrounds on each screen u loose the desktop icons. well u dont loose them but they stay "hidden" behind the wallpapers
2008-05-02T16:11:00.000Z	papat	mahadasda	I had no option enabled for special effects. They simply don't wanna show. It's veeeery annoying
2008-05-02T16:11:00.000Z	mahadasda	papat	- sry cant help u there then... im not THAT experienced. only had that error once and in my case that was the reason...
