2008-04-23T03:54:00.000Z	demonspork		 Bidget, it was hard when I did it, I had to compile all the packages to run it from their source code, such as g15daemon, g15lcd, graphlcd and a few others to get the screen running. I never did get the mappings for the extra G keys working quite right and eventually gave up on them
2008-04-23T03:55:00.000Z	Bidget	demonspork	yeah Ive tried doing that but I run into errors with dependencies when compiling all the packages and nobody seems to be able to help me hahaha. I don't even really care about the lcd screen or the g keys, I just want my media keys to work
2008-04-23T03:55:00.000Z	Bidget	demonspork	I'm trying to get them to control xmms but I'm not sure what my computer recognizes the media keys as so I cant bind commands to them :(
