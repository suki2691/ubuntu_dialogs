2008-08-15T20:56:00.000Z	qwertyasdf		Hi, total noob on ubuntu here. I need help getting my wireless network card to work, and connecting to the network at home. I'm on a very old machine, an Aopen 1847. Don't know very much about this machine unfortunately, hopefully somebody out there can help me get this fixed!
