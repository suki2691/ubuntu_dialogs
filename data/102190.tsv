2010-11-23T08:55:00.000Z	MTec007		looking for a reason as to why i can't get lucid to find the maverick upgrade
2010-11-23T08:55:00.000Z	rww	MTec007	because it's set to only update to LTSes. See the instructions ubottu's about to link you to
2010-11-23T08:57:00.000Z	rww	MTec007	Maverick's supported until April 2012. Lucid's supported on desktops until April 2013. Your choice.
2010-11-23T08:58:00.000Z	rww	MTec007	basically, if you want to upgrade every six months, upgrade to Maverick. If every two years, stick with LTS
