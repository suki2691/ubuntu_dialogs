2007-08-15T14:44:00.000Z	kornet		 i am trying to get neverwinternights to work. i am stuck at the glx install, witch one do i need for feisty? glx, legacy or new??? my card is mx4000-v64
2007-08-15T14:44:00.000Z	BrowneR	kornet	i would be tempted to try glx. if it doesnt work then just start again and choose legacy
2007-08-15T14:45:00.000Z	kornet	BrowneR	i tried all 3, no dice xtems dos not start and i gave to backup
2007-08-15T14:46:00.000Z	BrowneR	kornet	hmm i'm not sure, i have no experience with neverwinternights i'm afraid.
