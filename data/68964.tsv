2009-07-07T16:43:00.000Z	anr78		is there a way to make kde-applications look gnome-ish? I use krusader and digikam, and would like them to blend more in with the other applications I use.

2009-07-07T16:47:00.000Z	anr78	Titan8990	ok, should be done in a few minutes :)
2009-07-07T16:47:00.000Z	Titan8990	anr78	lol, they look the way they do because of the toolkit used in developing them, not much you can do about it
