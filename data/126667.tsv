2009-11-09T14:17:00.000Z	mohsin1		I have mounted my FAT32 volumes by enlisting them in /etc/fstab
2009-11-09T14:17:00.000Z	mohsin1		but they appear read only.
2009-11-09T14:18:00.000Z	mohsin1		How can I make them read write enabled?
2009-11-09T14:18:00.000Z	mechdave	mohsin1	you may need to add user to the options in /etc/fstab
