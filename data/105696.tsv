2011-01-06T06:38:00.000Z	someone_		I have a question concerning Hardy Heron (8.04 LTS): Is there any chance that the mplayer packet will be updated to the latest version?
2011-01-06T06:39:00.000Z	someone_		Or even better: Where is the packet update process decribed? (I'm thinking of a page where the conditions under which a packet will be updated are described)
