2011-06-20T18:43:00.000Z	nnull		rather trivial issue, full screen flash (eg: youtube) is very chuggy, any ideas on how i may resolve this?
2011-06-20T18:43:00.000Z	sudokill	nnull	is it 32 bit flash on 64 bit?
2011-06-20T18:44:00.000Z	sudokill	nnull	idk i heard 32 bit flash on 64 has some problems but i hear flash on linux isnt 100% great anyway
2011-06-20T18:44:00.000Z	sudokill	nnull	try reinstalling flash
