2008-10-28T11:25:00.000Z	genesismachine		I've just installed 8.10 on a macbook (2,1) and the keyboard is all messed up. What used to be keys 108 and 116 are now something else - 108 is the down arrow, not sure about 116. I now have no down arrow button. However, I know that X is detecting it correctly since in the gdm login screen, the arrow works fine... So it's something in my user profile
2008-10-28T11:25:00.000Z	genesismachine		Any ideas on what it is in my user profile that's messing things up?
