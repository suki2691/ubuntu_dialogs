2008-03-18T10:20:00.000Z	s3a		or at least one that can try to recover?
2008-03-18T10:21:00.000Z	rryan	s3a	: 'giis' is a tool that can sometimes recover recently deleted files from an ext2 or ext3 filesystem
2008-03-18T10:24:00.000Z	rryan	s3a	: no problem and good luck :) The most important thing to do once you've accidentally deleted a file is to stop writing to the disk that the file was on immediately. That will increase your chances of the tool working.
