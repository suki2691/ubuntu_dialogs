2009-03-05T02:13:00.000Z	wad		Hi folks. I'm running Ubnutu now! Compiz is working, but I'm still figuring out a few things though... right now I can use ALT-TAB to switch between apps, and it shows a little thumbnail of the app when switching, but the problem is that they all look similar, and I can't tell which is which. I think I'd like to try just showing the icon for the app, instead of the mini-screenshot.
