2011-09-15T10:35:00.000Z	sterna	Corey	save configs, purge, install again
2011-09-15T10:35:00.000Z	Corey	sterna	On this box there are 50 or so deps for squid.  Uninstalling it isn't an option.
2011-09-15T10:37:00.000Z	sterna	Corey	you can just purge it with no deps and apt will reinstall it on apt-get install -f
