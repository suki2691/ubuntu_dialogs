2004-10-05T05:09:00.000Z	pere		I just used updated to firefox 0.99+1.0PRubuntu. Suddenly find (as in ctrl+find) isnt working. Anyone else experienced that?
2004-10-05T05:09:00.000Z	Treenaks	pere	almost everyone, yes
2004-10-19T14:47:00.000Z	pere	Treenaks	Thanks for pointing me to the FAQ. However I have another question that probably is too basic for including into the FAQ: How do I add debian-marillat repository to my Ubuntu sources.list. Can I do that in Synaptic?
