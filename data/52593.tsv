2009-07-14T06:41:00.000Z	mac9416_		Hello, I am running Fluxbox and having a bit of trouble getting my sound un-muted or turned up. In Gnome I would use the panel applet, but that's not in Flux.

2009-07-14T06:44:00.000Z	mac9416_	ladislaio	thanks, alsamixer worked, and managed to wake me up when the sound suddenly came on ;-)
2009-07-14T06:45:00.000Z	ladislaio	mac9416_	you are welcome
