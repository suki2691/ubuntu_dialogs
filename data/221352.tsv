2005-09-07T12:24:00.000Z	lakcaj	Nalioth	yeah, I'm running debian ppc on my g/f's G3 ibook, using xfce4 to speed things up a bit, and it's not bad at all.
2005-09-07T12:25:00.000Z	Nalioth	lakcaj	ive not had a problem running ubuntu-gnome on my G3 ibook (way faster than the stock OS)
2005-09-07T12:26:00.000Z	lakcaj	Nalioth	I just did a base install, so I didn't get the opportunity to try gnome, but it's nice to hear that it is functional.
