2008-04-05T04:28:00.000Z	adamb		Is there a way to manually point an mx record to somewhere, like I would do in a hosts file.. for testing email.  Anyone know?
2008-04-05T04:28:00.000Z	unop_	adamb	you need a DNS named for MX records
2008-04-05T04:31:00.000Z	adamb	unop_	so the answer is no?
2008-04-05T04:32:00.000Z	unop_	adamb	yes, the answer is no.
