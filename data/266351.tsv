2009-10-06T12:49:00.000Z	ursus		hello! I speak about my friend's problem. He used win xp, but it crashed: he can't start the OS, because a blue screen appears only. We have a Xubuntu 9.04 live Cd, and we would like to use it to save the data from the hard disk. But the problem is, that gparted sees a big, unallocated partition only. How could we access to the data on the hard disk?
