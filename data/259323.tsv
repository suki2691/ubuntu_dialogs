2005-04-13T05:08:00.000Z	jhaig		I have just started updating to hoary now.  1h46m remaining - oh well.  ;-)
2005-04-13T05:09:00.000Z	jhaig		Will it cause problems if I am logged in while it is updating everything?  For example, what will happen when it updates X?

2005-04-13T05:11:00.000Z	Burgundavia	jhaig	I haven't had any issues with updating a system while lots of stuff is running
