2010-09-11T16:12:00.000Z	CaneToad		With Lucid, are there known issues with recent X servers?  I am finding regular [every day] lockups where the mouse moves but everything becomes non-responsive.  You can't do anything and have to kill X with CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE which is extremely bad.

2010-09-11T16:13:00.000Z	CaneToad	sprung	sorry I meant Karmic, not lucid
