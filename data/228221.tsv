2008-05-13T21:29:00.000Z	giloth		Could anyone who's been through the ATI driver nightmare be able to lend a hand? I have a Radeon 5500 and the automated Proprietary Driver messes up the display something awful. Would like to know if there is a manual how-to on the issue.

2008-05-13T21:31:00.000Z	serengeti	giloth	I have an HD2600 and I think I had to make a new xorg.conf after installing ati's driver
2008-05-13T21:32:00.000Z	serengeti	giloth	i don't remember exactly what I did but it involved running the aticonfig tool from the console
