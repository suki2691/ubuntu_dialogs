So far I've tried aMSN and Emesene I have had intermitten results with being able to connect with both of them saying that I am logged in at another location.  Has anyone else had this problem?

2011-02-18T05:08:00.000Z	JunglPerv	Logan_WP	because its is obviously not client support
2011-02-18T05:09:00.000Z	uRock_	JunglPerv	seek help through MS
