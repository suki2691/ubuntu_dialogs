2006-08-31T08:05:00.000Z	Nameeater		I want to apply a patch to grub and then install it as a .deb, I have done apt-get source grub and applied the patch, now how do I turn it into a .deb and install it?

2006-08-31T06:29:00.000Z	Nameeater		if I've downloaded the grub source (apt-get source grub) and patched it, then done apt-get -b source grub, which builds it and makes a .deb, and then I install it (dpkg -i grub*.deb) how do I set it up so it is the new bootloader?
