2007-04-20T15:51:00.000Z	Jonah		im having a problem with GRUB. my bootdisk is SATA and my ubuntu install is on a PATA drive. but the install refuse to install GRUB on the SATA drive, so i dont get any boot menu, it just boots directly to windows. <- Is it possible to use windows bootmenu somehow to boot ubuntu?
