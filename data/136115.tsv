2009-01-14T01:47:00.000Z	rohil		Hi All. Just installed 8.10 dual boot with Vista on my vaio. I had gone ahead with guided install but it didn't ask me to create swap partition anywhere. Now, while installing some packages , I am getting errors related to man-db like  "No space left on device"
2009-01-14T01:47:00.000Z	rohil		Any help would be appreciated

2009-01-14T01:49:00.000Z	Gnea	rohil	sounds like you didn't give it enough
