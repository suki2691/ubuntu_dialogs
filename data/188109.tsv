2006-12-02T08:37:00.000Z	hastesaver	DaGame	no, you *don't* have to do a fresh install!
2006-12-02T08:37:00.000Z	hastesaver	DaGame	you can just upgrade, and everything will work. Or at least, it ought to :-)
2006-12-02T08:39:00.000Z	hastesaver	DaGame	no, if you do a clean install it won't. But as I said, you don't have to a clean install. The recommended way is to simply upgrade.
