2008-05-07T23:35:00.000Z	iMoleskine		so no suggestions and nobody else with the problem of a damn slow ubuntu with an ati graphic card?
2008-05-07T23:36:00.000Z	Pici	iMoleskine	is there a reason you are using the -i386 kernel instead of the -generic one
2008-05-07T23:39:00.000Z	Pici	iMoleskine	install the linux-generic package
2008-05-07T23:40:00.000Z	Pici	iMoleskine	I dont believe that there are restricted drivers for i386, only -generic and AMD64
