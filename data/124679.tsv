2007-09-25T14:15:00.000Z	Irreducibilis		I am installing ubuntu right now to a 4 gig USB flash drive, in the backround, under Qemu, accelerated with Kqemu. This is USB 1.1.... even still, it has been installing for 3 hours now and its only at 47%
2007-09-25T14:15:00.000Z	Irreducibilis		Its installing at a steady speed of about 1% every 5 to 6 minutes, is this normal even for USB 1.1?
2007-09-25T14:15:00.000Z	eck	Irreducibilis	can you not just install it normally (i.e. not within qemu)?
2007-09-25T14:16:00.000Z	Irreducibilis	eck	No, I am using it specifically as an embedded within windows flash drive install
