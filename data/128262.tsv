2007-07-12T13:35:00.000Z	diamondcutter	Madpilot	any idea about what the problem might be why I can't get this to work in Feisty?
2007-07-12T13:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	diamondcutter	not sure. Last time I messed with the logo in the top-left corner was even further back than Dapper...
2007-07-12T13:38:00.000Z	diamondcutter	Madpilot	is it possible that since Feisty ships with the Human theme by default that I need to modify the icons in the Human directory?
2007-07-12T13:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	diamondcutter	possibly, but I'm not sure. I know that changing from the Human icons doesn't change the topleft icon. (I can't stand Human, parts of it are unusable...)
