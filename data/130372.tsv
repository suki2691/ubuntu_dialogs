2007-06-21T09:23:00.000Z	mezziah	bruenig	thank you but it doesn't work :(
2007-06-21T09:24:00.000Z	bruenig	mezziah	I am not sure what you are doing exactly but man is already in the path, there is no reason to screw with /usr/bin/man, it would have something to do with the MANPATH not the path to the man executable
2007-06-21T09:25:00.000Z	mezziah	bruenig	i don't know.. but i'm pretty sure it worked before messing with the .bashrc, so the problem should be there i guess
