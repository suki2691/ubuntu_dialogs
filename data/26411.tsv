2010-09-12T15:00:00.000Z	xiaclo	Besogon	there is only a handful of linux viruses, and they have been patched ages ago ... they are VERY rare and short-lived ... so you don't need an antivirus protecting the server ... for the windows boxes on the network though, look into ClamAV, it was designed for e-mail scanning, although you can adapt it to almost anything

2010-09-12T15:02:00.000Z	xiaclo	Besogon	i'm not sure if corporate antivirus software will work in linux, it's worth some research ... clamav is free, if you are looking for a paid solution, im afraid i'm not much help in that regard
