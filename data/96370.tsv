2008-10-31T21:49:00.000Z	linux_trojan		I was wondering if I should download the new UBUNTU immediately or if I should wait a few weeks to let the bugs work themselves out?
2008-10-31T21:49:00.000Z	linux_trojan		any suggestions?
2008-10-31T21:50:00.000Z	linux_trojan		that seems to be everyones advice, I think I will wait
2008-10-31T21:50:00.000Z	whoop	linux_trojan	install it, if there are any bugs for you they will be fixed sooner then ;-)
