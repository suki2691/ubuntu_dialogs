2006-01-27T16:26:00.000Z	y_o_u		i am trying to install kwin-baghira on Kubuntu Breezy. when i try apt-get install baghira, it cant find the package (am i supposed to putting a version in here: apt-get install baghira-0.7?). apt-get update, that i can tell, does nothing, and updating Adept seems to do nothing as well (no new packages). help. please. thank you.
