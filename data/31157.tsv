2010-07-02T09:21:00.000Z	DocPlatypus		yes it's kind of silly but it will at least tell you if they are valid zip data (yes they are zip files)
2010-07-02T09:23:00.000Z	IdeAleSs	DocPlatypus	everything is okay.  I actually recovered some from the last crash by deleting some content from the content.xml file in the archive.
2010-07-02T09:23:00.000Z	DocPlatypus	IdeAleSs	cool
