2007-12-24T21:05:00.000Z	Dan_		trying to install WICD, installer says it conflicts with netword-manager, and that network-manager is installed. I go to add/remove, and network-managers is infact, not installed.
2007-12-24T21:07:00.000Z	Dan_		anyone?
2007-12-24T21:08:00.000Z	Pici	Dan_	Don't use add/remove, that doesnt show system packages.
