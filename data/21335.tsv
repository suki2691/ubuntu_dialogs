2011-02-22T19:06:00.000Z	Jinxed--		I need to copy a backup image of my systsem from an external harddrive to a internal harddrive but im out of usb ports. I only have the ennough for usb thumbdrive which im using to boot a live version of ubuntu. Is it possibly to somehow set up a network where I could copy from an external drive connected to a different laptop to an internal drive from my live usb?
