2007-07-27T14:57:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	lnx^	something with journaling
2007-07-27T14:59:00.000Z	lnx^	howlingmadhowi1	what would that be? i'm using ext3 now but it's rather slow
2007-07-27T14:59:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	lnx^	ext3 has journalising. so does reiserfs and quite a few others. have a look on wikipedia
