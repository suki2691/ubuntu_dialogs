2006-12-13T11:00:00.000Z	tuxub		how can I burn a disc with a file with 4GB ??? I tried brasero, gnome baker and k3b and all of them failed to burn the disc
2006-12-13T11:00:00.000Z	nothlit	tuxub	the ISO filesystem only supports files less than 2gigs, you'll need to split the file
2006-12-13T11:01:00.000Z	nothlit	tuxub	anyways, look into the split command
2006-12-13T11:02:00.000Z	tuxub	nothlit	I can burn those type of discs in windows with nero. are you sure?
