2005-08-27T14:06:00.000Z	Sammi_		I am trying to install emacs and I followed the instructions ('cd' to the directory, then './configure',) but then it couldn't find gcc or cc and it gave me the error "configure: error: no acceptable cc found in $PATH".

2005-08-27T14:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	Sammi_	you can install emacs from synaptic, or using apt-get
2005-08-27T14:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	Sammi_	emacs is on the ubuntu install CD -- or you can install it off the net
