2007-02-22T08:28:00.000Z	JimBeam		hi, im using ubuntu server: is there a way when i'm doing: "apt-get -f install" to avoid being prompted for the cd? meaning a command i can use that all packeges should be downloaded, not being fetched from the  cd

2007-02-22T08:29:00.000Z	ledbettj	JimBeam	sure, use the # sign
