2008-03-20T03:59:00.000Z	exegesis		I can't boot into Vista.  When I try it loads and then says "Startup Repair is checking system for problems.  Attempting Repairs........Repairing disk errors.  This might take over an hour to complete."  I can't cancel the thing and it never finishes.  What can I do?
