2009-04-22T18:32:00.000Z	bidossessi	wgrant	i'm already dualbooting, but i'd like to use a chainloader instead of a menu entry, to keep things separate and clean. so on the ubuntu i have right now, i haven't installed grub. can i do it manually and set it to find itself a place on my ubuntu root partition? a link to how would be helpful
