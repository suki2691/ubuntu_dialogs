2007-12-15T16:47:00.000Z	NooBBoon		I have installed 7.10 (alternative) but after re-booting, black screen. GRUB loads, "Kernal alive" appears, "...direct manning table appears", screen blacks. Suspect gfx card=Geforce 8800GTS. I have d/l drivers from nvidia, but unsure how to see anything to be able to install them. Absolute newbie to ubuntu!
