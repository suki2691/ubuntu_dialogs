2008-10-20T11:07:00.000Z	dekushrub		i tried to plug in an external hard drive and i was told it could not be mounted because it needed to be safely removed in windows, anyone know anything about this
2008-10-20T11:08:00.000Z	ziroday	dekushrub	yes you need to mount if with the -o force option, it should tell you about that in the error message
2008-10-20T11:08:00.000Z	dekushrub	ziroday	how do i do that?
2008-10-20T11:09:00.000Z	ziroday	dekushrub	if you read the error message it will give you the command you need, unfortunatly I can't remember it
