2010-03-02T11:04:00.000Z	Ascavasaion		My bluetooth-applet has gone haywire.  It does not allow me to browse/detect USB devices.  It suddenly started detecting two USB bluetooth dongles when there is definitely only one bluetooth device in the computer.  I can pon scriptfilename and the latop connects to the USB bluetooth dongle and cellphone and works perfectly.  PLEASE can someone help me sort out this stupid bluetooth applet nonsense.?
