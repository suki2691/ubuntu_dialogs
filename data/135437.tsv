2007-05-11T13:35:00.000Z	Greyhound		I have an Intel P4 2.4 GHz, 768 DDR RAM and a nVidia GeForce MX440.. can anyone tell me if I can run the desktop effects (I'm mostly interested in the cube) :D

2007-05-11T13:37:00.000Z	bsod	Greyhound	sorry, it seems to work
2007-05-11T13:37:00.000Z	bsod	Greyhound	i switched a month ago from xp to ubuntu and i never looked back :-)
