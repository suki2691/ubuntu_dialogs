2005-07-25T09:11:00.000Z	desrt		is there a way that i can give apt a .deb file and tell it to install it properly with all its dependancies?
2005-07-25T09:11:00.000Z	desrt		ie: instead of tossing it to dpkg -i and screwing up my system...

2005-07-25T09:13:00.000Z	_frank	desrt	I'm not sure how to do it when you start from a .deb file
