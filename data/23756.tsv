2011-02-05T05:31:00.000Z	LinuxNoob		i just installed steam using wine, it asks for username and password to log into steam, starts logging in, shows all the steam crap that first pops up, then closes, what is happening?

2011-02-05T05:32:00.000Z	robehend1	LinuxNoob	that case, the path would be /home/username/Desktop/, etc etc
2011-02-05T05:33:00.000Z	robehend1	LinuxNoob	steam.exe
