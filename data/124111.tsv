2007-08-21T13:03:00.000Z	plbeaudoin		I'd like to get the basic compiz in Festy to work... It used to work before I try compiz fusion, now, none work
2007-08-21T13:04:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	plbeaudoin	compiz-fusion is in heavy development, unless you know what your doing dont go near it
2007-08-21T13:04:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	plbeaudoin	any other questions on this go to #ubuntu-effects
2007-08-21T13:04:00.000Z	plbeaudoin	Paddy_EIRE	that's why I'm reverting to the bundle, ok bye
