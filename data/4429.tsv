2012-04-04T15:43:00.000Z	somebody__		hey, i want to write a bash script that finds all tex documents in a folder (find . -type f -iname ".tex") and then uses sed to attach two lines, one line after the first to add \begin{refsection} and one second to last \end{refsection). can someone please help me with the correct sed command?

2012-04-04T15:44:00.000Z	kpow	somebody__	sed s/sed/perl -e/g
2012-04-04T15:45:00.000Z	somebody__	kpow	that would only replace sed with perl no?
