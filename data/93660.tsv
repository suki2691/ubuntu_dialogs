2008-08-26T22:53:00.000Z	r4b		Following kernel update 2.6.24-19, my wireless interface completey vanished, but I managed to restore it by downgrading. Why does this happen?
2008-08-26T22:54:00.000Z	jereme	r4b	did the restricted modules package for 2.6.24-19 get installed?
2008-08-26T22:54:00.000Z	jereme	r4b	perhaps your driver is included in that package
2008-08-26T22:55:00.000Z	r4b	jereme	i dont know. What can i do about it?
