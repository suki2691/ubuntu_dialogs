2005-06-02T05:15:00.000Z	JackHanna		I'm feeling a little stupid.. this is a box set up for a friend who lives in the basement.. I haven't updated it in months.. and now I forget the root password.. is there any way to reset it or something with a boot cd?

2005-06-02T05:16:00.000Z	olsen	JackHanna	did it work?
