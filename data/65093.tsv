2010-04-01T20:38:00.000Z	yvan300		could anyone help me a bit with this conky?
2010-04-01T20:40:00.000Z	yvan300		i downloaded this config and it said that all the files need to be in the same folder in order for conky to work properly, where should i put it?
2010-04-01T20:42:00.000Z	yvan300		but would conky know that the files are located in that folder?
