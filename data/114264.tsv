2012-03-09T13:29:00.000Z	_ruben	tintoy	you'll need a 3rd party syslog app for windows (there's several of those out there)
2012-03-09T13:31:00.000Z	_ruben	tintoy	there's both free and non-free ones, and don't repeat
2012-03-09T13:32:00.000Z	_ruben	tintoy	use google, we use ntsyslog, but there's better ones nowadays i think
