2006-02-24T14:02:00.000Z	kennethd	larson9999	yes, one or the other (shutdown or startup)... pretty sure all *nixs do
2006-02-24T14:04:00.000Z	larson9999	kennethd	all don't.  mandriva doesn't... at least not by default.  i have stuff in /tmp on my mandriva box that i've had there since the 90's :)
2006-02-24T14:05:00.000Z	kennethd	larson9999	ok, well all my debian, red hat, fedora & solaris boxes do... and I'm pretty sure it happens on this ubuntu laptop too
