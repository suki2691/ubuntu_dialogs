2012-03-30T18:38:00.000Z	flami		Hi there. it seems that I need the nvidia-current pakcage (295) from precise , but that wants to update half of my system with it, is there a way to get that package without all these dependencies on 11.10 ?
2012-03-30T18:38:00.000Z	flami		Oh then lemme google for that . thanks
2012-03-30T18:40:00.000Z	flami		well I need the new driver so the cuda sdk 4.1 runs. so I can build stufff. I dont quite know how to build the nvidia binary driver ... well since its a binary driver :P
2012-03-30T18:40:00.000Z	sirknight	flami	 maybe but what i heard is that you are better off to recompile the package to have it work ... nvidea is the better of the two packages though
