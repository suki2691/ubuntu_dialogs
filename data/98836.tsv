2008-10-17T05:21:00.000Z	arrrghhh		so i have an issue with nautilus.  it randomly doesn't show files in folders!  it literally says 0 items.  i can view the same files using ls, thunar, etc...
2008-10-17T05:23:00.000Z	arrrghhh		it's for my girlfriend, i want to make this as *simple* (read: break-proof) as possible.
