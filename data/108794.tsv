2011-02-17T02:04:00.000Z	jazzyjef		I am trying to create a fake root filesystem and use ath5k modules in the kernel either as loadable module or within the kernel itself
2011-02-17T02:04:00.000Z	jazzyjef		 when i try to make it as a loadable module, my modules.dep files are missing
2011-02-17T02:04:00.000Z	jazzyjef		 and now i have just compiled the modules as part of the kernel using make menuconfig, but still my device cant use it, how can i make sure that the ath5k module is part of the kernel
