2011-12-05T20:26:00.000Z	Wolfsherz		hello, can someone tell me how to find out why my cpu gets so hot under ubuntu 11.10? even while idle...
2011-12-05T20:26:00.000Z	is_null	Wolfsherz	maybe you can run the "top" command
2011-12-05T20:27:00.000Z	is_null		and find something eating your cpu ...
2011-12-05T20:28:00.000Z	Wolfsherz	is_null	there is no process that eats up cpu on that list unfortunately.
