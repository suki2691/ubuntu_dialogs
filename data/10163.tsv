2011-09-26T00:53:00.000Z	astartoth		hi all, how can I make urxvt's color exactly like gnome-terminal's?
2011-09-26T00:53:00.000Z	alkafoo	astartoth	change it in ~/.Xdefaults, then run xrdb ~/.Xdefaults
2011-09-26T00:54:00.000Z	astartoth	alkafoo	exactly. But I can't seem to find the correct color code and pass it to ~/.Xdefaults as 'URxvt*background: rgba:xxxx/xxxx/xxxx/xxxx
2011-09-26T00:58:00.000Z	alkafoo	astartoth	if you really can't find it, just take a screenshot and sample it
