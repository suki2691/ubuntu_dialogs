2008-02-20T16:41:00.000Z	feysalus		I've been reading through some sites, and I've seen some linux user's systems hacked and their bash shell histories, files, db's etc. accessible to the intruder - so how much more secure is linux than windows?
2008-02-20T16:41:00.000Z	compwiz18	feysalus	are you running any network services?
2008-02-20T16:42:00.000Z	compwiz18	feysalus	then far more secure then windows :)
