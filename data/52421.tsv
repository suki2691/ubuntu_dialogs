2010-04-05T02:48:00.000Z	Alcor		i was a sys admin for 14 years on a main frame Unix system.  I simply asked why.  There is not a unix system out there that doesnt have a root passwd
2010-04-05T02:49:00.000Z	Alcor		so I was simply trying to understand your reasoning behind what you were saying
2010-04-05T02:50:00.000Z	Alcor		My Ubuntu came with a root passwd already setup - That means somebody knows it - So I simply reset it.  No security risk...
