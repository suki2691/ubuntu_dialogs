2009-08-05T14:28:00.000Z	frank_b		I'm using jaunty and I've just installed a more recent version of amule (from karmic) and all it's depencies (also from karmic). now nicotine (another P2P program) doesn't run. I'm thinking of upgrading all my system to karmic to try to solve the problem. anyone here recommends otherwise?
2009-08-05T14:29:00.000Z	frank_b		anyone here recommends against upgrading to karmic now?
