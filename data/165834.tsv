2006-10-28T11:31:00.000Z	ArrenLex	ThinkingMan	compare the backup of xorg.conf to the current version... it'll tell you what changed.
2006-10-28T11:32:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Ever since I installed dapper, my openoffice looks like this: http://arrenlex.diff.be/32509.png Is there any way to fix it?
2006-10-28T11:32:00.000Z	ThinkingMan	ArrenLex	where's the backup located? (normally)
