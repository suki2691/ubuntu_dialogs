2011-06-08T19:51:00.000Z	ukr_888		Ah sorry, relatively new to IRC. This is my last resort for answers. I am having issues with mounting NFS on Ubutnu 11.04. My debian server is hosting the NFS shares (4 of them) and when I mount them under ubuntu they are all the same, pointing to the same directory on the server.
2011-06-08T19:51:00.000Z	ukr_888		I am using NFSv3
2011-06-08T19:51:00.000Z	pfifo	ukr_888	does it work correctly on other computers?
2011-06-08T19:53:00.000Z	pfifo	ukr_888	test it, could be a possible version mismatch too
