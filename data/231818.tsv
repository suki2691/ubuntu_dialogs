2005-06-17T06:54:00.000Z	Miks		is there any defragmentation application for linux? because when my booted this time it said it needed some check and now it tells me it has 1.4%non contiguous blocks...what could i do about that?

2005-06-17T06:56:00.000Z	Miks	PMantis	... yea my system got stuck today because my processor got too hot and i had to restart it manually because i had no choice
2005-06-17T06:57:00.000Z	PMantis	Miks	fsck is what you want, then.. may have already been suggested upon bootup though.
