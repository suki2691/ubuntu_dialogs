2008-10-03T01:42:00.000Z	Chowder		Can anyone help me with a printer question?
2008-10-03T01:44:00.000Z	Chowder		I just bought a brand new HP F4280 printer and upgraded hplip to the latest release. My printer is recognized, print jobs are accepted, but it won't actually "print" anything
2008-10-03T01:44:00.000Z	Chowder		I have the output of hp-check on pastebin. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated
