2008-11-28T04:29:00.000Z	PrebenR		problem is that on my desktop the fonts are not so big.
2008-11-28T04:29:00.000Z	PrebenR		why should they be on the small screen?
2008-11-28T04:30:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	PrebenR	you can change the basic fonts in system->prefs->appearance
2008-11-28T04:44:00.000Z	PrebenR	zsquareplusc	mkerd, snuitje: I set the Font DPI to 96, and now it looks fine. I guess the problem is that System Default is 133
