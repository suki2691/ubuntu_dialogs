2012-07-20T05:03:00.000Z	escott	peugi	tread careful. you can break unity easily messing around in there
2012-07-20T05:05:00.000Z	escott	peugi	thats a couple years out
2012-07-20T05:06:00.000Z	escott	peugi	you can do it. but if unity starts crashing and you have to ctrl-alt-f1 to get to a tty and rm -rf ~/.compiz or unity --reset then you are back to square one
