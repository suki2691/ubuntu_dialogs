2009-06-20T03:42:00.000Z	sandy_		I am running ubuntu 9.04 solely.  I am having trouble installing windows 98 (SE).  I put the CD in, selected the boot sequence to go to CD first, and no go.  It just starts up Ubuntu.
2009-06-20T03:44:00.000Z	sandy_		hmmm...is there a way to circumvent grub?  I wish I didn't have to get windows but there are like 2 things that need it.
2009-06-20T03:46:00.000Z	sandy_		I tried virtualbox but couldn't seem to load 98 from the CD
