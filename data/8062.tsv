2012-04-20T12:09:00.000Z	EvilResistance	fsgxdroid	 first question: why do you need to downgrade?
2012-04-20T12:15:00.000Z	EvilResistance	fsgxdroid	 after my openssl updates, sure (if it ends up with that version)
2012-04-20T12:22:00.000Z	EvilResistance	fsgxdroid	 but Google's SSL CertAuth certs are public and are included in most system CA certs
