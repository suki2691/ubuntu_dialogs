2006-07-30T05:56:00.000Z	garkoil	AndyCooll	do u think there are torrents for WinXp WM ?
2006-07-30T06:02:00.000Z	garkoil	AndyCooll	how can I use the drag and drop feature to files in VMware under my ubutu ?
2006-07-30T06:07:00.000Z	AndyCooll	garkoil	Not sure. In truth I've never had need to use that feature since all my files (including Home/My Documents) on a file server. And I've mapped the drives on the XP Vmware image
