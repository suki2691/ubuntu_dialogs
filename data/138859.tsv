2007-04-19T10:37:00.000Z	Angeluz		Still no one here who can help me with my problem concerning the "cannot allocate memory"-errormessage when opening a program through the gnome-panel?
2007-04-19T10:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	Angeluz	you're out of memory?
2007-04-19T10:37:00.000Z	Angeluz		It all works fine, when I do it from a starter on my desktop or my gdesklets starterbar.
