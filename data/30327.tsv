2011-04-27T03:15:00.000Z	ThomasB2k		Thank you ZykoticK9
2011-04-27T03:16:00.000Z	matrixa1	ThomasB2k	i have the beta, and yes, the updates are rolled out on the fly
2011-04-27T03:17:00.000Z	matrixa1	ThomasB2k	just make sure to check the topic in #ubuntu+1 because some updates break things before stable is rolled out
