2010-05-05T06:48:00.000Z	pink_panther	sdfghjkl	: Just connect it once and next time you are logged automatically.
2010-05-05T06:48:00.000Z	sdfghjkl	hiexpo	pink_panther, it's not doing that for me.  I have to manually choose the network name from the list.  It remembers the password, but I have to click on it each boot (fresh install of 10.04 this weekend)
