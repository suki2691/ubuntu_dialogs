2009-09-01T12:08:00.000Z	amisam		I just recently updated my xorg.conf to handle my 5 button mouse but now I can't use (or remap the keys) to compiz setting "enhanced zoom desktop"  everything else seems to work
2009-09-01T12:08:00.000Z	amisam		any ideas?
2009-09-01T12:09:00.000Z	ultraputz	amisam	- conflict?
2009-09-01T12:10:00.000Z	amisam	ultraputz	I am assuming so but I haven't been using compiz since back in the beryl days
