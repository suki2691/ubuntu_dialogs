2010-05-30T05:03:00.000Z	mophead		Hey everyone!  Just checking in to see if there are any updates re: flash problems in firefox.  Since updating to Lucid I can't get sound and some flash sites just don't work period.
2010-05-30T05:04:00.000Z	mophead		so just sudo apt-get remove flash ?
2010-05-30T05:05:00.000Z	mophead		then sudo apt-get install flash?
