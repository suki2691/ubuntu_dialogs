2009-12-08T05:37:00.000Z	denise		hi i'm trying to add a printer to a currently updated 9.04 system...  the printer is on a SMB share on my windows xp box...  the Printer Configuration tool keeps crashing while browsing the shares...   is this a known issue
2009-12-08T05:37:00.000Z	denise		?  and does anyone have an easy work-around?
