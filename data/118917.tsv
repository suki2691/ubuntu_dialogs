2008-02-29T21:06:00.000Z	ubunt1		Istill can't figure out how to install the script I need for installing the display ACER AL1717. The terminal window is not even installed yet, so I have to install at"install driver from CD" in the very beginning of starting up from Live CD.

2008-02-29T21:12:00.000Z	bazhang	ubunt1	what I am saying is that you likely do not need a driver for that monitor
2008-02-29T21:14:00.000Z	bazhang	ubunt1	try rebooting in safe mode
