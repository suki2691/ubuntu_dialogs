2011-04-24T20:22:00.000Z	phil42	vanguard	 i had thought that all or almost all the linux dvd player software is region free
2011-04-24T20:25:00.000Z	vanguard	phil42	the drive ignores the disk, has nothing to do with the software
2011-04-24T20:26:00.000Z	phil42	vanguard	 i have heard that you can change the region 5 times
