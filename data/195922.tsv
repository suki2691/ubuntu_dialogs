2008-06-21T19:59:00.000Z	Unimatrix9	Shubbar	. insert the cdrom , package manager should see it, and asks if you want it as source
2008-06-21T20:01:00.000Z	Unimatrix9	Shubbar	, go to system / software sources
2008-06-21T20:02:00.000Z	Unimatrix9	Shubbar	and uncheck all online sources , untill you only have the cdrom as source
