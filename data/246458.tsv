2007-05-06T14:05:00.000Z	Tarkus		anyone know why some of my programs stay in the taskbar on all workspaces? (firefox, thunderbird, totem, and im sure there are others).. they just stay in the taskbar when i switch to a different workspace. and if i click on it from another workspace it rotates the cube back to the workspace that i opened the program in.. any suggestions on how to fix this?
