2012-06-06T07:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		i have a large /boot/ partition - because i segtt up grub2 to boot differnt iso files that i keep on /boot/ which is on  a seperate hard drive then my main install
2012-06-06T07:42:00.000Z	jwcarman_	Dr_Willis	you don't have to have the /boot partition anymore?  You can just put that crap on the / partition?
2012-06-06T07:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jwcarman_	 you can. but in m y case i got /boot/ on sda by itself. (with windows  after it) linux is on sdb. I can boot a ubuntu iso file from sda and reinstall to sdb -- very fastg ;)
2012-06-06T07:44:00.000Z	jwcarman_	Dr_Willis	very cool.  I've got my /boot as a separate 512MB partition on my SSD too
