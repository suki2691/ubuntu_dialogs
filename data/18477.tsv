2011-02-10T14:39:00.000Z	Nietecht		I'm getting a new hard drive. Is there a way 'transfer' my ubuntu installation to the new disk, or do I need to re-install from scratch?

2011-02-10T14:39:00.000Z	Nietecht	llutz	thanks, I'll look that up
2011-02-10T14:39:00.000Z	llutz	Nietecht	after that, adjust /etc/fstab and grub, reinwrite grub
