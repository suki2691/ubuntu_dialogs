2010-01-21T03:16:00.000Z	DrWolfen		Hi!  Lately I've been having an issue with my netbook using ubuntu 9.10.  After downloading and installing an update, I shut down my computer.  When I restarted it, my computer would load up past grub, show the ubuntu symbol for a couple seconds and then completely freeze.  After experiencing this, I tried running ubuntu in recovery mode, but I would get an error saying /sbin/init:error while loading shared libraries: /lib/l
2010-01-21T03:16:00.000Z	DrWolfen		ibdus-1.so.3: only ET_DYN and ET_EXEC can be loaded, a lot of other text and then "*ERROR* panic occured, switching back to text console, and then the comptuer is frozen again.  I've tried going into the grub menu and booting from older kernels, but the same thing happens.  I've also tried reinstalling ubuntu through a live CD image in a USB stick and that has also been unsucessful.  Does anyone have any idea of what's wrong
2010-01-21T03:16:00.000Z	DrWolfen		 and what I should do?  I've scoured the depths of google and I'm stumped
