2008-01-22T07:23:00.000Z	supersako		if i have ubuntu installed already and i just add kubuntu-desktop... is there a performance hit running kde this way? or will it be the same as if i uninstalled everything and just install kubuntu?
2008-01-22T07:25:00.000Z	supersako		thanks
2008-01-22T07:25:00.000Z	supersako		has kubuntu got better i am reading conflicted reports online ... most people are saying that it is not the best kde distro
