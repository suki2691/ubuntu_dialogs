2010-01-14T01:22:00.000Z	psyphercode		hi all, i have been annoyed with a problem in ubuntu since almost fore ever., it happens on every install of ubuntu of various different hardware. recently i was told that it's the sata drivers and i must upgrade to karmic, well i have upgraded to karmic and the problem is still there.
2010-01-14T01:22:00.000Z	psyphercode		problem is that as soon as there is ANY kind of high disk activity, and not even THAT much, just having 2 copying threads will do it, and the entire pc comes to a grinding halt, firefox greys out and locks up ALL the time and i can barely do anything. since i am constantly doing large file copies, using vmware, encoding videos, unraring files I have to constatnly sit and wait for my pc to become responsive.
2010-01-14T01:22:00.000Z	psyphercode		why am i told I am the only person who has this issue, I don't believe that for a second. i would really like to squash this bug one and for all, it's driving me nuts, and as one for the biggest linux/ubuntu fanboys it's actually driving me back to winblows!!!! PLEASE help
