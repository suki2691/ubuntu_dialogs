I also set the fixed IP and netmask. But now I can't seem to communicate with the outside world - stuff like wget no longer works. Am I missing something?
2012-03-10T14:57:00.000Z	acroyear2		Would I need to set default gateway as well?
2012-03-10T14:58:00.000Z	wylde	acroyear2	if you set a static ip yeas, because dhcp is no longer setting that for you
