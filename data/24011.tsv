2010-11-09T09:29:00.000Z	Mariojinx		I'm trying to compile an Xcode project under Linux. Can anyone help?
2010-11-09T09:30:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Mariojinx	I'm going to say that it's probably not possible unless it's portable C/C++ code
2010-11-09T09:42:00.000Z	Mariojinx	tensorpudding	The code is cubescript.
