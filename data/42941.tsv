2010-11-01T20:03:00.000Z	Roasted_	dl551	because they are naive and closed source with their drivers.
2010-11-01T20:03:00.000Z	Roasted_	dl551	I got so raged with broadcom wifi I ended up ebaying an N wireless card for 14 bucks for my laptop. 100% of my problems were solved just by going to Intel wifi instead of broadcom wifi.
