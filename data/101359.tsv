2008-02-04T15:23:00.000Z	CloCkWeR1		i'm having fun with a new usb external hdd + feisty; and so far the (limited) forum posts I've read haven't solved my problem. What do I search for or what information should I paste to get more info/help/solutions? (Welland me-740ps usb 2.0 hdd case + west. digital hdd)

2008-02-04T15:26:00.000Z	CloCkWeR1	Kevin`	both! so far the best I've got is a very limited flashing of lights when the 'puter loads. It doesn't appear in lsusb / mounted anywhere
2008-02-04T15:26:00.000Z	Kevin`	CloCkWeR1	what appears in dmesg when you plug it in
