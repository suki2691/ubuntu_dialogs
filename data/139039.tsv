2008-02-03T06:44:00.000Z	onexused	Cruller	What sound card?
2008-02-03T06:46:00.000Z	onexused	Cruller	I know the mic hasn't been gotten to work for some sound blaster cards.  I'd have to look about Intel HDA.
2008-02-03T06:47:00.000Z	onexused	Cruller	I'm having sound problems on a different linux OS and that's mostly what I get too, lol.
