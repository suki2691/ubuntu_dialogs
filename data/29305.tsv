2010-07-08T19:19:00.000Z	rystraum	caps_lock	You can view the files that comes with the package on Synaptic. There's a tab on the package info.
2010-07-08T19:20:00.000Z	caps_lock	rystraum	I am looking at the information for a package I have not yet installed, so it won't list that information
2010-07-08T19:22:00.000Z	rystraum	caps_lock	Ah. I see what you meant. I tried it myself and never really noticed that I don't get to see the files if it's not yet installed. Sorry. @_@
