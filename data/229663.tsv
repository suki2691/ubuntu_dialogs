2007-01-29T15:59:00.000Z	AzMoo		Can anybody help me with setting up a BIND caching server? I'm reading https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BIND9ServerHowto but it's not particularly helpful. It says it's set up by default, but it's not working. I changed the nameserver on my client to point to the server and it's telling me that www.google.com is an invalid domain.
