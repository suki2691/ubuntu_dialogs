2007-02-09T17:29:00.000Z	timShady		hey ho all, having a little problem upgrading the kernel in my edgy. I was originally on named kernels, but changed to the 'generic' ones when going to 2.6.17-10. Version 2.6.17.11 got listed on my updates today, but it seems that I have broken packages (unmet dependencies on kernel headers, linux-image-generic and linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-11-generic). Any clues?

2007-02-09T17:31:00.000Z	Terminus-	timShady	maybe. the i'm having problems with linux-image-2.6.15-28-686 deps. the most recent i see on launchpad is -27. there's -50 there that's proposed AND published (mind boggling). i've got the -27 installed right now.
