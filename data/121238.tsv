2011-02-11T01:52:00.000Z	lake	scampbell	not sure how to configure sudo. looking around now. thanks
2011-02-11T01:58:00.000Z	lake	scampbell	that is true, I tried "sudo env" and it does what you're saying
2011-02-11T02:03:00.000Z	scampbell	lake	we apply NOPASSWD: to those sort of things but we keep it locked down to the particular command line you want to run.
