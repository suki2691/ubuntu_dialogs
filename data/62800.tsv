2009-06-12T23:52:00.000Z	elli222		Hello, resuming after a suspend remounts my root filesystem Read only. This has massive side effects...
2009-06-12T23:53:00.000Z	elli222		is there any fix for it?

2009-06-12T23:55:00.000Z	Orange_v_Blue	elli222	just shut down? I have a similar problem, in that when i suspend, I basically have to restart anyway, so I usually just shut down, and then restart. It's a quick enough restart that I don't really mind. less helpful, I know, but it works
