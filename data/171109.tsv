2006-08-13T09:16:00.000Z	JackMacOKC		I have an Athlon64 4400 X2, which is better - amd64 or k7 kernel?
2006-08-13T09:17:00.000Z	frogzoo	JackMacOKC	for desktop, 32bit is better supported - go k7
2006-08-13T09:17:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	frogzoo	and k7 automatically includes SMP support, right?
2006-08-13T09:21:00.000Z	frogzoo	JackMacOKC	not sure if k7 is smp enabled, but I'd say it was pretty likely
