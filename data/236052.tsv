2005-09-13T06:27:00.000Z	sorush20	pepsi	what exactly is the problem
2005-09-13T06:28:00.000Z	pepsi	sorush20	linux is on hdd, grub is on the MBR of hda, and hdb didnt exist before, but now it does, so i think grub tries to boot hdb instead of hdd
2005-09-13T06:30:00.000Z	pepsi	sorush20	can i dpkg-reconfigure grub?
