2010-08-06T22:36:00.000Z	Alonea	jonathanrlively	I dont use those. I use the ones from this guide:http://linuxon1001p.blogspot.com/2010/03/fixing-wireless.html
2010-08-06T22:37:00.000Z	rooks	Alonea	i recommend intel 5300 wifi for lappy, especially if you have 3 antennas, i only have 2 in my lappy but nevertheless the card works very well
