2010-05-20T18:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mootsoo	 virtualbox has its own special share feature. Or you can use whatever other services you want. as if it was a real pc. See the  Virtualbox manual for info.
2010-05-20T18:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mootsoo	 the special share feature reqwuires the vbox guest addations installed on teh guest Os
