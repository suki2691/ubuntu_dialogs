2011-09-30T16:44:00.000Z	ahhughez		Im using mythbuntu, and its menu is different to ubuntu's... can someone confirm they have Applications -> System -> Preferences ?
2011-09-30T16:45:00.000Z	ahhughez		Is there a cli way to load system -> preferences?
2011-09-30T16:45:00.000Z	jamesw	ahhughez	see menu editor, right click on the menu and go to menu editor. each preferences action is it's own program
2011-09-30T16:48:00.000Z	ahhughez	jamesw	this doesnt appear to have a menu editor :'(
