2007-09-25T14:59:00.000Z	tretle		<murkyMurk> you should think twice before recomending cedega... it may work better than wine for games but the fact that it the offspring of wine(opensource project) and they charge cedega is just Hilarius... Plus windows emulation may be a good alternative for the time being but encouraging people to give up on native ports as cedega generally does is just wrong
2007-09-25T15:01:00.000Z	tretle		<murkyMurk> I understand your point but that doesnt stop the fact they are selling partial ex opensource code in their own name... I dont see them paying ex wine contributers for their contribution to the cedega project

2007-09-25T15:05:00.000Z	skarface	tretle	maybe it doesn't much matter if people want to pay someone else to make wine work right for them
