2009-01-02T01:26:00.000Z	_2	Trijntje	and yes the rest looks right.   you can even add other ips if you like
2009-01-02T01:29:00.000Z	_2	Trijntje	it's not supposed to cause any issues.  but there are some chars i always try to avoid '&-$%@!#' if possable
2009-01-02T01:31:00.000Z	_2	Trijntje	for command lines sake.  enevadable i end up with an unquoted string some where, and some chars then throw a wrench in the cogs
