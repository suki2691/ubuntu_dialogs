2009-12-20T11:55:00.000Z	Artelus		Hi, I just installed Kubuntu dual-boot with Windows 7.
2009-12-20T11:55:00.000Z	Artelus		Kubuntu sucks, I want to remove it. Can I just go into Windows 7 and delete the partitions that Kubuntu created while installing?
2009-12-20T11:55:00.000Z	Artelus		Or is there something complicated that I don't know that could mess up my booting if I do that. I don't know.
