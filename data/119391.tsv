2010-06-15T15:17:00.000Z	Slyboots		Anyone any idea?
2010-06-15T15:17:00.000Z	bazhang	Slyboots	remove the repo as with any other
2010-06-15T15:18:00.000Z	bazhang	Slyboots	then edit the /etc/apt/sources.list
2010-06-15T15:20:00.000Z	bazhang	Slyboots	once that is edited, then sudo apt-get update; you can edit by commenting out the repos with a # in front of the ones you wish out
