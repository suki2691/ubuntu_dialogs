2007-06-08T07:18:00.000Z	SaveFerris	cwillu	yup, went through all of those fine to the best of my knowledge
2007-06-08T07:19:00.000Z	cwillu	SaveFerris	try it again, but just hit enter for everything (everything selected should be the detected settings)
2007-06-08T07:20:00.000Z	SaveFerris	cwillu	alright, it's up, guess i was reading too much and not just pressing enter the first time, thx, peace
