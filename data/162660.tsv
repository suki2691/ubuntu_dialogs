2008-03-18T02:05:00.000Z	seanh		I just had a laptop crash during a feisty-to-gutsy upgrade. It crashed at the 'Remove obsolete packages?' part, just as I was about to press 'Remove.' This should be ok, shouldn't it? The actual upgrade was finished at this point
2008-03-18T02:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	seanh	yes, once booted, sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get upgrade;sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2008-03-18T02:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	seanh	and a sudo apt-get autoremove couldn't hurt either
2008-03-18T02:07:00.000Z	seanh	PriceChild	- thanks, will do those
