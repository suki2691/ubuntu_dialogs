2007-04-05T05:47:00.000Z	Kendreague	predaeus	I checked the CD before this install, it's never been used before, shipped from Canonical. The hard disk checked out in Norton Disk Doctor before I formatted, along with Disk Utility (Before OS X crashed.) I'll re-install now anyway.
2007-04-05T05:48:00.000Z	predaeus	Kendreague	hm, that sucks. No idea, sorry.
