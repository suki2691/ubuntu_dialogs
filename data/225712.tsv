2005-08-07T06:58:00.000Z	windex	ka234	there can be a lot of bad things for linux. the thing is, if you follow the ubuntu 'rootless' philosophy, the chances of browser bugs leading to system compromise is slim.
2005-08-07T06:59:00.000Z	windex	ka234	the biggest thing linux has going for it is that it's a smaller userbase than windows. if that starts to change, you will see more effort put forth into taking control over linux-based machines. but it's _much harder_ to do, and would depend on bugs that change between each distribution. so it's unlikely, even if.
