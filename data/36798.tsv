2010-02-22T11:28:00.000Z	the_jackdaw		Im trying to Dual boot win7 and ubuntu, installed win first and then ubuntu, same disk different partitions. Shouldnt GRUB overwrite the windows bootloader?
2010-02-22T11:29:00.000Z	the_jackdaw		Then why does it not do that, GRUB does not start at all, windows starts instead
