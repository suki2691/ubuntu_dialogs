2010-07-10T13:13:00.000Z	Damascene		hi, the sound recorded from my mic is noisy. what should I do?
2010-07-10T13:15:00.000Z	crab234	Damascene	try a different microphone to see if it's a problem with the microphone?
2010-07-10T13:16:00.000Z	crab234	Damascene	so you've determined it is the microphone then?
2010-07-10T13:17:00.000Z	crab234	Damascene	I'd try the same mic/audio card running on Windows and see if it's a Ubuntu-only problem
