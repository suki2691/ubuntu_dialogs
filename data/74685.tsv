2008-11-09T12:20:00.000Z	t7th_Sense		Somebody help me. I have win xp and ubuntu at the same HD. Now win xp crashes. Is it save for me to format C: and reinstall win xp?
2008-11-09T12:21:00.000Z	osbert	t7th_Sense	yes, but when you reinstall XP it will mess up grub or whatever your boot loader is so you should save a boot disk that will let you boot back in later.
2008-11-09T12:22:00.000Z	osbert	t7th_Sense	and don't reformat the whole thing, just any partitions that XP is using (probably the 1st one)
2008-11-09T12:25:00.000Z	t7th_Sense	osbert	mine is grub. You mean if I dont make emergency disk then my pc won't restart anymore?
