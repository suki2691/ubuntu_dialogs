2009-08-24T23:23:00.000Z	exutable		Is anybody interested in collaborating on writing a driver for a fingerprint scanne? It is probably going to be written in C and is going to be approximately 300-1000 lines of code.  I can offer help via providing sniff logs, monetary donations and some programming help
