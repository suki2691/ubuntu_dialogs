2010-01-16T10:27:00.000Z	etfb		How do I create an xorg.conf file in Karmic, so I can override the stupid auto-detect settings with better ones?
2010-01-16T10:28:00.000Z	acclaimtech	etfb	do this
2010-01-16T10:29:00.000Z	etfb	acclaimtech	I want to make one that has all the current auto-detected settings in it already, so I can find which one is wrong.
2010-01-16T10:35:00.000Z	acclaimtech	etfb	oh I think this is 100 times better than 7 or vista
