2010-03-21T17:07:00.000Z	eueu		Hello, I am trying to TAR some directory under Ubuntu, and untar that archive on Windows. The problem is that some sub-directories contain non-ASCII characters in their name
2010-03-21T17:07:00.000Z	eueu		When I untar that archive on Windows I obtain a wrong file name.
