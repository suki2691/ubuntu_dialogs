2007-07-18T05:21:00.000Z	CerebroJD	lousygarua	tried man pages?
2007-07-18T05:22:00.000Z	lousygarua	CerebroJD	sure. i had such experience with drupal for example. installed from synaptic, and had no idea how to start, where were base-drupal-system the files installed, nothing
2007-07-18T05:22:00.000Z	lousygarua	CerebroJD	but drupal has no man page :)
