2012-05-11T22:34:00.000Z	blacklight		again, is any of you aware of a valid way for fixing the issue with broadcom wifi cards in 12.04? i'm using BCM4313 on my laptop, the workaround shown here https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/jockey/+bug/995318 doesn't seem to work and the network interface is not even recognized anymore, i didn't have this problem with 11.10 but only with 12.04

2012-05-11T22:35:00.000Z	blacklight	ZenMaster	so no workaround available for now? i tried the blacklisting and the new driver, but now the interface is just not recognized anymore..
