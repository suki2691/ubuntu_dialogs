2009-11-13T04:19:00.000Z	pbbd	kostkon	i download my lecture files from class and they are encrypted (if i open in windows media player in xp they download license and play fine)
2009-11-13T04:20:00.000Z	kostkon	pbbd	hmm. ok. i don't think it's possible to play them on ubutnu. the only way could be to burn them on a cd and then extract them as mp3s for example.
2009-11-13T04:20:00.000Z	pbbd	kostkon	okay thanks
