2008-06-03T09:43:00.000Z	cmatt85		I hate to bother you guys but, i am running feisty(7.10) I let it update a few days ago and since then i seem to have lost some desktop functionality, i can no longer see my icons and the context click (on the desktop) no longer functions. Any ideas?
2008-06-03T09:44:00.000Z	cmatt85		hello?
