2007-12-28T22:46:00.000Z	WGGMk		When installing VMWare Server Console, it will NOT let me run the install script unless im a super user.. After installing it (with sudo) it will not let me run vmware-server-console unless im I user sudo.. How can I install this so that it shows up in my Applications and doesnt require sudo from terminal??
