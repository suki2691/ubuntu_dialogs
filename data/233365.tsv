2009-07-28T21:21:00.000Z	SirTopHat_		http://pastebin.com/d34d27578 look at this, I'm trying to install openssh-server, it tells me it needs openssh-client installed first because it's a "dependency", and yet when I go to install openssh-client it's already there
2009-07-28T21:23:00.000Z	SirTopHat_		this is madness, I haven't gotten a single answer for anything in here
2009-07-28T21:24:00.000Z	sheep	SirTopHat_	it looks like you have a newer version of openssh-client than what that openssh-server package supports
2009-07-28T21:25:00.000Z	sheep	SirTopHat_	where are you installing the packages from?
