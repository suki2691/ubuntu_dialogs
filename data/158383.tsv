2008-12-19T22:46:00.000Z	vesayth		Hello! I just have a small question, more of an annoyance than a problem. My trash bin says there is 1 item in trash but there is absolutely nothing in it. Anyone have any idea why? It started happening after my upgrade to 8.10 (on 64-bit).

2008-12-19T22:49:00.000Z	Slart	vesayth	hehe.. actually I haven't searched in launchpad.. can't really say I've tried finding out why it behaves the way it does.. but removing it and adding it again fixes it for me
