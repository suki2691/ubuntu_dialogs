2010-06-19T23:50:00.000Z	aj00200	JonathanEllis	are you sure screen is an html editor? I've seen a different tool called screen
2010-06-19T23:50:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	aj00200	screem with an m at the end not an n
2010-06-19T23:51:00.000Z	aj00200	JonathanEllis	oh, ok. Its kind of hard to tell on my TVs resolution
