2007-08-24T12:37:00.000Z	chuy_max		I can telnet port 25 and it gives me appropriate messages
2007-08-24T12:38:00.000Z	n2diy	chuy_max	you don't know your user name?
2007-08-24T12:40:00.000Z	n2diy	chuy_max	you didn't tell me anything, I was scanning the messages, and replied to you. No user name, no long in, simply.
