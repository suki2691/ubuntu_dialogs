2009-12-16T18:55:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Shay27	no, that would need the tar to be editted before extraction which doesnt make sense
2009-12-16T18:56:00.000Z	Shay27	MASARUwota	what i mean is that i have tar archive containing files and folders , i would like to extract the files to 1 folder without the folders structure from the archive ?
