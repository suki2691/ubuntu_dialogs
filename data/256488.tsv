2008-12-01T02:12:00.000Z	ptchemist		anyone care to assist with 8.10 and connecting via hostname?  I can only do it via IP since upgrading to 8.10
2008-12-01T02:13:00.000Z	ptchemist		did standard setup with 8.10 Desktop, want to get webmin running.  Presently have static IP w/ local router to cable modem
2008-12-01T02:14:00.000Z	ptchemist		from one host to 8.10 desktop host
2008-12-01T02:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	ptchemist	 i just make /etc/hosts files with the hostname/static ip. for all the machines on my network. Thats the easy way at least
