2008-12-02T19:29:00.000Z	inordkuo		hi all. i am having freezing issues with intrepid 64bit. i've upgraded to the latest proposed kernel, disabled networkmanager, tried killing the pulseaudio process but still get freezes
2008-12-02T19:31:00.000Z	aldarsior	inordkuo	how random are these freezes?
2008-12-02T19:32:00.000Z	inordkuo	aldarsior	actually they seem to occur more when i am recording tv to an ntfs drive but i read that ntfs-3g should never cause freezing
2008-12-02T19:33:00.000Z	aldarsior	inordkuo	does it ever crash when it's not dealing with fuse?
