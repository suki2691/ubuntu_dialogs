2011-11-19T00:11:00.000Z	Adriannom		 hi.  just built a new machine and i transferred my ssd from my old machine to the new.  however, when i boot i get the error "gave up waiting for root device".  if i wait a while and type exit the error repeats.  if i load grub and try recovery mode i get a blank screen forever.  i also tried deleting the UUID from grub and the error persists.  i've booted a livecd and i can't actually see any disks under the sata host
2011-11-19T00:11:00.000Z	Adriannom		 adapter.  i can see the disk in the bios though.  any ideas what i could try next?
