2011-10-24T15:10:00.000Z	private_meta		Am I terribly wrong or is it not possible to install Ubuntu Server (10.04) normally (interactive) without internet connection?
2011-10-24T15:10:00.000Z	reisio	private_meta	should be fine, desktop as well
2011-10-24T15:11:00.000Z	private_meta	reisio	I didn't have a cable plugged in, couldn't configure wifi, told me it can't continue because of malconfiguration and not being able to contact the ubuntu mirrors
2011-10-24T15:11:00.000Z	reisio	private_meta	sounds like a job for Debian, then
