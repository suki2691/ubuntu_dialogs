2012-05-21T05:20:00.000Z	catlover2		Hello, I have a quick question about hardlinks.
2012-05-21T05:21:00.000Z	catlover2		If I made a hardlink of a file, will removing the hardlink also remove the file that it points to?
2012-05-21T05:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	catlover2	 IF its the last hardlink to the file. a hardlink basically is a 2nd name to a file.
2012-05-21T05:23:00.000Z	catlover2	Dr_Willis	So I can delete the hardlink without removing the file that it points to, right?
