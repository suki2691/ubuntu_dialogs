2005-10-21T11:50:00.000Z	brlancer		it didn't in hoary, but after upgrading to breezy it conflicts somehow
2005-10-21T11:51:00.000Z	mahangu	brlancer	sorry mate still running hoary - works fine for me
2005-10-21T11:52:00.000Z	brlancer	mahangu	yeah, I had hoped upgrading would fix other problems, but this one is just dumb
