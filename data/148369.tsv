2008-01-22T21:15:00.000Z	OmegaCenti		Well, I have been searching for a while now, and is there any reason why I wouldn't be able to connect to a vpn running ubuntu in a virtualbox?
2008-01-22T21:16:00.000Z	riotkittie	OmegaCenti	are you pointing at the right IP address? mhat about firewalls? port forwarding issues?
2008-01-22T21:17:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	riotkittie	for all I know, the information about the vpn is very correct.
2008-01-22T21:17:00.000Z	riotkittie	OmegaCenti	oh :| then i have no clue, sorry
