2009-03-22T03:22:00.000Z	militant	davey____	  i was just always under the impression a smaller kernel was potentially more stable, and system resources wouldn't be used on things that aren't needed.  trimming it down to just the hardware and functions your particular setup needed.
2009-03-22T03:25:00.000Z	davey____	militant	i've never heard of more stability, ofcorse if you hang out at #gentoo the'll tell you anything precompiled is bad, but i don't really think it's a big deal
