2007-04-15T12:54:00.000Z	TimonUbuntu		I live in australia, a bit out of the way, i'm not too worried about anybody hacking my wep at the moment, but is Ubuntu hard to set up for WPA? is it hardware dependant?

2007-04-15T12:55:00.000Z	icicled	TimonUbuntu	the good thing about wifi-radar is that it also runs as a daemon so it will connect to what it can automagically upon bootup
