2009-02-25T10:51:00.000Z	CyberSurfer		Kay, I don't like VLC that much, I rather use Mplayer
2009-02-25T10:52:00.000Z	CyberSurfer		The video works but the sound doesn't
2009-02-25T10:52:00.000Z	Huufarted	CyberSurfer	the benefit of VLC is it's inclusion of all major codecs, negating the need for additional installs
