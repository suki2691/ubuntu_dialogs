2006-09-15T14:05:00.000Z	suyog		sudo has stopped asking me for password! what can i do?
2006-09-15T14:06:00.000Z	suyog		no. it hasn't asked me password for the last one week now. even after reboots
2006-09-15T14:07:00.000Z	suyog		it just executes the commands without password. isn't that unsafe?
2006-09-15T14:07:00.000Z	JoseStefan	suyog	does your user have a password?
