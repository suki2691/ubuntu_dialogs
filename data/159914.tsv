2006-11-15T12:13:00.000Z	Limulf		I want Ubuntu (6.10) to start without opening any windows from its previous use, so I have changed my session configuration, unchecking the save session changes automatically option. My problem is that i don't know how to prevent from appearing two windows: the session manager and a Nautilus window showing my home directory. I have tried to remove the gnome-session-properties from the current session tab in the session manager
