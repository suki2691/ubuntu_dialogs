2006-07-01T14:21:00.000Z	diego	cius	the program can specify that it doesn't want to be decorated
2006-07-01T14:22:00.000Z	cius	diego	and of course thats the only way, right?  Gnome's philosophies getting in the way again...
2006-07-01T14:22:00.000Z	diego	cius	X's philosophies on window types. there's probably another way though
