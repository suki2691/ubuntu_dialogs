2008-02-14T19:18:00.000Z	idnzor		hey, i want to upgrade to hardy development because i want to develop a patch for something, but i cannot be bothered to do a frsh install. is there a way to upgrade to hardy without manually changing sources.list?
2008-02-14T19:19:00.000Z	idnzor		yeah, understand its beta, dont mind if it borks my system. i just dont want to upgrade up changing the sources.list coz that usually messes things up.
2008-02-14T19:19:00.000Z	idnzor		i need to develop a patch against the latest gnome sources.....
2008-02-14T19:19:00.000Z	jrib	idnzor	consider just installing hardy in a virtual machine and develop there
