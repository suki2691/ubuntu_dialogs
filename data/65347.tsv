2010-01-02T04:01:00.000Z	nigtv		Hi. So I was in here last night talking with a few people on harddrive issues, I'll skip the long story and just say that although I don't seem to be able to boot off of this harddrive at all since it crashed (seemingly for no reason), its been detected in every computer I've put it in, as well as passing IDE diagnostic tests.
2010-01-02T04:02:00.000Z	nigtv		I'm wondering where I should go from here, I would like to get the data on there, I am going to try to use a live cd, one more time, they have not been booting but a good quality cdr. I mainly just am wondering if there is any feasible way to tell if a harddrive is really dead.

2010-01-02T04:05:00.000Z	nigtv	Jeruvy	I'm finding it very strange that it passes this test, which I suppose could only take 20 minutes to read the size of the drive and the partition table, but it does both on 3 different computers without a snag or anything, and the harddrive is silent as it ever has been, as soon as I get this live cd burned I'll try fsck though
