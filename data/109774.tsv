2007-12-16T03:13:00.000Z	pope22		i'm looking for an e-mail client that will handle pop3, as well as webmail such as Yahoo. (i know yahoo offers pop3 access, but only for a fee)
2007-12-16T03:14:00.000Z	Flannel	pope22	there are some webmail scrapers, that act as a proxy pop server, and get the mail via http.
