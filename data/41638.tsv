2009-12-29T13:43:00.000Z	iKernel		I've got a laptop with an express card slot, it has a dummy card in it without an eject button and I can't seem to pry it out. anyone experienced this issue? the manual tells me to "Press the ExpressCard eject button to partially extend it out of the computer." but there's no such button

2009-12-29T13:45:00.000Z	n00p		err, so how do I tell if my Ubuntu world is 32-bit or 64-bit?
2009-12-29T13:45:00.000Z	iKernel	n00p	I tried, but I don't think I can actually see the dummy card, just some strip of strong plastic covering it
