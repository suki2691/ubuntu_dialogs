2011-06-04T20:02:00.000Z	computerx		Filesystem on an ever increasing pool of disks: XFS/ext and symlink, ZFS? Other suggestions? I won't JBOD raid them because I don't want to lose everything if one dies.
2011-06-04T20:04:00.000Z	computerx		Is xfs as stable as ext? Is the journaliing as good? Is there any reason I should choose one over the other (avg filesize will be 200mb
