2011-10-31T14:16:00.000Z	Renex		Q: i am trying to install ubuntu 7 from DVD on a computer where I have windows 7. On ubuntu.com it says there should appear Install ubunto alongside windows 7, however that option does not appear. When I go to Something else only one partition appears (having as size the total amount of space on the harddrive), however when I browse from CD on Ubuntu all partitions appear. What's wrong and how can I fixt this?
