2008-03-04T15:49:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet		Hi all .. fired up a new box tossed Ubuntu Server 8.04 Alpha5 (AMD64bit) and it is not playing nice with bash_completion. It'll finish out directories (sudo /etc/apac<tab>) but not applications .. like sudo aptit<tab> inst<tab> smartmo<tab> .. it just beeps.
