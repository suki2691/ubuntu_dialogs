2010-03-09T05:19:00.000Z	DrDamnit		Hi! 15 minutes after my Ubuntu Desktop 9.10 x64 has been on, the screen goes black. The adapter turns off. Have to restart to get it to come back on. Any ideas?
2010-03-09T05:20:00.000Z	airtonix	DrDamnit	tried changing the power management options so the screen doesnt blank ?
2010-03-09T05:20:00.000Z	DrDamnit	airtonix	Yes. Turned off the screen saver and powermanagement.
2010-03-09T05:23:00.000Z	airtonix	DrDamnit	im out of ideas, probably use your excellent and much sought after googleFu mastery to find relevant information on ubuntu forums ?
