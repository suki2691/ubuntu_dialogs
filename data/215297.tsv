2007-02-21T07:04:00.000Z	White_Lightning		is there any way to make ubuntu automatically log in to an account and totally bypass the logon screen? I've got a box that I'm setting up as a pvr and I want to vnc in to it, which I can do, but right now I have to hook up to it, log in, and THEN I can vnc.
