2012-06-18T20:00:00.000Z	BlazemoreWork		Hello
2012-06-18T20:01:00.000Z	BlazemoreWork		Does anyone know how I can list all the users who are authorised to ssh in as a local user, without having to parse authorized_users myself?
2012-06-18T20:03:00.000Z	BlazemoreWork		What's the point of a firewall if upnp allows arbitrary ports to be opened by any old application?
2012-06-18T20:04:00.000Z	Praxi	BlazemoreWork	plus the port is only opened from the inside
