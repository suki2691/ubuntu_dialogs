2005-04-02T12:46:00.000Z	Ruby_live		hey... guys... i had a problem with X-server (new installation) some one told me to dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, but the system says xserver-xorg is either broken or not fully installed... what now?
2005-04-02T12:46:00.000Z	vixus	Ruby_live	So are you on commandline?
2005-04-02T12:47:00.000Z	vixus	Ruby_live	Have you done anything dodgy, I couldn't get X to work after upgrading to hoary.
2005-04-02T12:47:00.000Z	vixus	Ruby_live	Sure
