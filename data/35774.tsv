2010-03-18T22:15:00.000Z	frikinz	york105	yes yes. I use easytag too, it's good. I'll try that.
2010-03-18T22:16:00.000Z	frikinz	york105	but the repository server I know is musicbrainz. how is it supposed to detect which song it is (I'm not talking about cds, mp3)
2010-03-18T22:16:00.000Z	frikinz	york105	I'm actually looking for something to find covers and put them in the directory
