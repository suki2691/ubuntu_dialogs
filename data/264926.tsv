2005-09-14T16:19:00.000Z	Fraeon		I'm doing a mistake by downloading the preview of Breezy(after the Colony 4 woes) but I'm doing it anyway
2005-09-14T11:02:00.000Z	Fraeon		Grrr...anyone got an idea what would be causing the fact that Breezy just doesn't want to go online?
2005-09-14T11:02:00.000Z	bur[n] er	Fraeon	we need some more info... got an ip?
2005-09-14T11:04:00.000Z	bur[n] er	Fraeon	you have to get the modules built for the new kernel
