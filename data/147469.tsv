2007-01-29T07:17:00.000Z	Kud		I am downloading themes in tar format from GNOME-Look.org, but they won't seem to install when I try to install them. I get an error saying "File is not correct format". Can anyone help?
2007-01-29T07:17:00.000Z	wrox	Kud	apt-get install beryl
2007-01-29T07:18:00.000Z	Kud	wrox	apt-get can't find that program
