2007-07-24T12:23:00.000Z	sauvin		Drowelf: yes. You can format its drive.
2007-07-24T12:24:00.000Z	sauvin		Drowelf, why not use gparted or partition magic or something?
2007-07-24T12:25:00.000Z	DrowElf	sauvin	vista doesn't allow for any partitioning software other than its own... now I got ubuntu on a small partition but I want to enlarge it.. can't enlarge without format, right?
