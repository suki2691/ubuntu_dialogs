After a few hours of working, my wireless network stops working and can't reconnect, I can't run anything with sudo, and opening a terminal window won't work.  It worked fine in Feisty, and jnc was positive that its my network, but i can't find anything wrong with it.  I've added a root user so I could see if I could log in to see whether it was a pam issue, and had no trouble logging

2007-10-24T18:55:00.000Z	godzirra	zombie_monkey	Yeah, mine just stpos working.  I can't use sudo, and I can't reconnect to my network, or open another terminal window in X;.
