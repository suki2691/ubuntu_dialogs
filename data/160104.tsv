2006-12-01T12:21:00.000Z	ClayDragon	mister_roboto	personally i think the winxp approach with creating a "hibernate-diskfile" where all the memory is stored during hibernation is a much better idea than storing it in the swap partition
2006-12-01T12:22:00.000Z	mister_roboto	ClayDragon	i'd like to know the anwer to your question too. since your swap is likely gonna get filled, or close to it, from memory, i can't see how it would survive another linux using it
2006-12-01T12:23:00.000Z	ClayDragon	mister_roboto	thats exactly what i thought. i have 1gb main memory, and an i admit oversized swap of 3 gb
