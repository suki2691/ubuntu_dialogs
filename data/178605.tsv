2010-02-28T00:47:00.000Z	eremite		For some strange reason Ubuntu thought I wanted to change my mail program from Thunderbird to Thunderbrid 3 and it looks like crap.  The text is all white on a white background and it's hardly useable.  How do I fix this major mistake?  I didnt want Ubuntu to mess up my mail app, which should work fine since I havent doen any tweaking to this system except for updates.
