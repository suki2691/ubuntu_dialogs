2011-02-02T10:39:00.000Z	linuxrunner		Hey, when I downloaded nouveau to replace the standard nvidia driver, I try to watch videos on miro, and it locks up?  Any help?
2011-02-02T10:40:00.000Z	avis	linuxrunner	whats run with the restricted driver for nvidia ?
2011-02-02T10:40:00.000Z	linuxrunner	avis	I don't understand the question
2011-02-02T10:40:00.000Z	avis	linuxrunner	why not use the restricted driver ?
