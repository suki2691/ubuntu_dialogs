2010-04-28T07:29:00.000Z	hcook		hey guys. working with thinkfinger on lucid...sudo/gksudo/gnome-screensaver are all working now. but i'm still unable to swipe to login. i ran the pam setup script, and i've looked over the /etc/pam.d files and they look good to me...anybody know what i might be missing?
2010-04-28T07:31:00.000Z	hcook		one document said to go to system->administration->login window, then to the local tab, and set a bunch of things...but i don't have "login window" at all...i've got "login screen" but it doesn't have any tabs or any of the options mentioned in the doc
2010-04-28T07:32:00.000Z	hcook		has stuff like 'Themed with face browser' and 'Selected Only' and choose 'Human List' moved to some other configuration screen?
