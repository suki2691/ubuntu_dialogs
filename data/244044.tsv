2005-03-31T14:30:00.000Z	Daehlie		i am wondering what the default setting of the root password is in ubuntu, there was no part in the install for the root password
2005-03-31T14:31:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Daehlie	do you mean, "Why there is no default root account?"
2005-03-31T14:32:00.000Z	Daehlie	onkarshinde	yes, i guess that is what I am asking
2005-03-31T14:33:00.000Z	Daehlie	onkarshinde	can I just create a root account from my user account
