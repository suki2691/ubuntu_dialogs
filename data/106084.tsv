2008-06-10T21:48:00.000Z	ksbalaji		I had to uninstall audacity as the beta version supported by hardy cannot find my sound output device. The repository also does not contain a stable audacity version. Any help pl?
2008-06-10T21:49:00.000Z	Bodsda	ksbalaji	if it is in the repo's then the Ubuntu devs/community believe it to be 'stable'
2008-06-10T21:51:00.000Z	ksbalaji	Bodsda	but audacity, 1.3.+ is a beta version. In my computer, It does not recognize my sound device!
2008-06-10T21:51:00.000Z	Bodsda	ksbalaji	im not disputing that im just saying it is considered stable enough for the repo's
