2009-01-07T18:51:00.000Z	LordMetroid	serengeti	maybe reporting to both would be good...
2009-01-07T18:52:00.000Z	LordMetroid		hmm, but I think that Ubuntu have some kind of cooperation with various developers and passes bug reports on to the developers of the particular software
2009-01-07T18:55:00.000Z	serengeti	LordMetroid	that's why I'm asking. I think I've read somewhere that bugs should be reported to launchpad and not upstream, but I'm not sure about it.
2009-01-07T19:00:00.000Z	LordMetroid	serengeti	report it to launchpad then
