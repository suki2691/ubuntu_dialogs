2007-06-12T13:04:00.000Z	alaQ	arkygeek	short answer: maybe, most likely not.  It would be much safer to just install clean instead of place over sid.
2007-06-12T13:05:00.000Z	arkygeek	alaQ	yeah, i suspected that...
2007-06-12T13:05:00.000Z	alaQ	arkygeek	native packages differ quite a bit - it could get nasty.
