2007-05-17T16:57:00.000Z	ziggy23		I am trying to port my Windows OpenVPN config file to Ubuntu, Nautilus is not letting me paste it (the option is grayed out).  Any ideas as to why this happens?
2007-05-17T16:59:00.000Z	ziggy23		the config files are on a windows ntfs volume which mounts as /dev/sda2 in linux
2007-05-17T05:00:00.000Z	ziggy23		I am not sure if I can save it (linux newbie here).  What should I do?
