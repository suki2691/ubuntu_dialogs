2008-10-15T20:04:00.000Z	v4vijayakumar		I have installed ubuntu 8.04. LTS. Is it possible to upgrade to upcoming ubuntu 8.10 (?) via update manager, or, I have to download through torrent, burn into dvd, install again...??

2008-10-15T20:07:00.000Z	joaopinto	v4vijayakumar	but reinstalling is most of the times a better option :)
