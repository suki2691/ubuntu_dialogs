2010-04-03T11:25:00.000Z	captain-obvious	paul3333	 why such an old version?
2010-04-03T11:27:00.000Z	paul3333	captain-obvious	i need to be able to run dreamweaver and photoshop in wine, and the newer versions aren't compatible
2010-04-03T11:28:00.000Z	paul3333	captain-obvious	the reason I moved to ubuntu is because my machine is old and the most I can run on it is xp, and I got hacked a lot of times which is bad for business since I develop for a living :)
