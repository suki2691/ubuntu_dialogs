2009-01-02T02:44:00.000Z	bobertdos		I wish to install the 32-bit java plugin into Firefox 64-bit. I've followed the wiki, and the link is valid, but the plugin doesn't install no matter where I link it.

2009-01-02T02:48:00.000Z	miranda_psi	bobertdos	I have downloaded an early build of it and the directory is there for the plugin, but I haven't actually tried to use it and it has also been said on several news sites
