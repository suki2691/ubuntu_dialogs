2006-03-01T13:45:00.000Z	[blah] 	Sonobana	it gives you (realtime) info on your CPU.  Processing speed, chipset, switches things like if it has MMX SSE2 etc
2006-03-01T13:46:00.000Z	[blah] 	Sonobana	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2
2006-03-01T13:48:00.000Z	[blah] 	Sonobana	like cpuinfo but better.  But cpuinfo suffices
