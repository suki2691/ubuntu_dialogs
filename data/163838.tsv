2008-09-03T21:31:00.000Z	timthelion		Environment variables don't seem to exist to commands run with sudo.  How do I get arround this?  I would like to share my envoronment variables with sudo run commands...

2008-09-03T21:32:00.000Z	timthelion	erUSUL	I don't have a root user?  Where do I put root's .bashrc then?
2008-09-03T21:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	timthelion	/root/
