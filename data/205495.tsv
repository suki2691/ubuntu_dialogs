2012-05-31T18:52:00.000Z	UserBuntu		I have a problem, and I am using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. The system doesn't recognize my monitor, and every once in a while, i get a resolution of 800x600(4:3) , instead of 1920x1080(16:9)
2012-05-31T18:52:00.000Z	UserBuntu		i have generated xorg.conf
2012-05-31T18:52:00.000Z	UserBuntu		should that do the trick ?
