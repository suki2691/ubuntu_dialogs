2009-04-25T00:25:00.000Z	slayton	maximumbob	yes, sudo apt-get remove --purge flashplugin-nonfree then download the latest flash from adobe
2009-04-25T00:25:00.000Z	maximumbob	slayton	Thanks I'll try the purge... last time I downloaded from adobe though it failed, "Wrong architecture: i386". I'm on amd64.
2009-04-25T00:28:00.000Z	maximumbob	slayton	Where should I put the .so? In /usr/share/mozilla/plugins? In /usr/lib/firefox/plugins? Perhaps ~/.mozilla/plugins?
