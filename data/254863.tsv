2005-04-01T07:01:00.000Z	mattgirv	kent	I would recommend a new installation but that is just personal preference.
2005-04-01T07:02:00.000Z	kent	mattgirv	and why would you recommand it?  Sorry if i ask stupid questions, its just that Im curios about how it works. If there can be differences from an upgrade compared to a new installation.
2005-04-01T07:07:00.000Z	mattgirv	kent	ahh, i thought you were upgrading warty>hoary... no dont worry then, i assume it will just be minor package updates from now on
