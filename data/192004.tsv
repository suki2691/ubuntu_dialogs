2006-04-26T10:17:00.000Z	djtansey		a general question about backups: what is a good way to backup images/music/etc that you don't want to compress (so that permissions/dates/etc are maintained)
2006-04-26T10:18:00.000Z	orbin	djtansey	er, just copy the file/folder?
2006-04-26T10:18:00.000Z	djtansey	orbin	that won't maintain the same permissions or the creation dates.
2006-04-26T10:18:00.000Z	orbin	djtansey	yeah, sorry. :)
