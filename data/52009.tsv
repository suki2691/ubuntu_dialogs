2012-05-17T13:34:00.000Z	wendico		i updated and i cant install GMAMEUI from the software center anymore, what alternatives do i have?
2012-05-17T13:35:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	wendico	according to ubottu, gmameui is there
2012-05-17T13:36:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	wendico	then it's probably already installed...
2012-05-17T13:44:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	wendico	please run "sudo apt-get install gemameui" and copy/paste the output to http://paste.ubuntu.com
