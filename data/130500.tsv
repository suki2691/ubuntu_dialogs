2007-06-17T11:40:00.000Z	BarlowBrad		i just installed ubuntu and my wireless usb adapter (belkin G) recognizes my wireless network, and lets me put in the network key and everything, but it does not actually connect to the router... any pointers?

2007-06-17T11:51:00.000Z	Perdente	BarlowBrad	I'm not sure exactly, you're sure its not on the network's side?
2007-06-17T11:54:00.000Z	Perdente	BarlowBrad	ok, go to terminal and type in iwconfig eth1 (for some reson I can't see pm's)
