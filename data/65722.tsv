2009-02-21T23:18:00.000Z	madmike		anyone know why when I logon, conky opens in it's own window and covers whatever toolbars and panels happen to be under it?  I switched own_window to "no" in the config, and then it doesn't load at all at logon.  I have to open it manually to get it to work right

2009-02-21T23:20:00.000Z	madmike	Richaee	 in the sessions thing I added "conky" to startup
