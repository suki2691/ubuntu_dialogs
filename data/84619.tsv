2008-07-25T09:06:00.000Z	Ogata		I'm trying to follow the usplash instructions on wiki. I would install libbogl-dev but couldnt find it. I'm using hardy. Should I enable some specific repository to do that?
2008-07-25T09:07:00.000Z	nickrud	Ogata	it's in the main repository libbogl-dev is.
2008-07-25T09:07:00.000Z	nickrud		!hardysources | Ogata (try this then the install)
