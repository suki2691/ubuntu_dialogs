2007-02-24T12:11:00.000Z	the-king		how would I change my kernel to 2.6.8-2-386?
2007-02-24T12:11:00.000Z	arrenlex	the-king	You wouldn't. Use -generic.
2007-02-24T12:12:00.000Z	arrenlex	the-king	The -386 kernels are obsolete and used as a fallback. For a standard computer, you want the -generic kernel instead.
