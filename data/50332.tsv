2011-09-18T14:25:00.000Z	Aer121		Hi I was wondering if someone could give me some help with a Ubuntu 10.4 LTS Live CD
2011-09-18T14:26:00.000Z	Aer121		I have a spare hard drive I want to wipe the data from to make data recovery harder or near impossible, is there a tool for this or command line included in the Live CD to wipe a drive ?
2011-09-18T14:27:00.000Z	Aer121		are these included in the live cd or must i install ubuntu and then wipe or shred ?
