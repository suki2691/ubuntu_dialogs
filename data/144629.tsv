2007-12-07T02:45:00.000Z	_Roman		I am using Ubuntu 7.10 with compiz.  Is there a way to set the strength of the attraction of the wobbly windows snap to the edge of screen?

2007-12-07T02:48:00.000Z	crdlb	_Roman	you can disable edge snapping entirely if you want
2007-12-07T02:48:00.000Z	_Roman	crdlb	I do not want to disable it all together (it is really useful), but the windows are too "sticky" by default
