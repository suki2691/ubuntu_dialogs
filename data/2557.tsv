2012-06-10T22:03:00.000Z	Avrem		does the default ubuntu mysql distro install with a database "test"?
2012-06-10T22:05:00.000Z	RBV	Avrem	log in and do 'show databases;'
2012-06-10T22:05:00.000Z	Avrem	RBV	I did. I did a show database and see a db called "test" created. Not sure where it came from -- which makes me slightly paranoid
2012-06-10T22:06:00.000Z	RBV	Avrem	are there any users that look out of the ordinary?
