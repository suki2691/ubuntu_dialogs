2008-03-13T14:33:00.000Z	Joelio		hey guys, getting a 403 Forbidden from archive.ubuntu.com when trying to do an upgrade (heron)
2008-03-13T14:34:00.000Z	Joelio		any info?
2008-03-13T14:36:00.000Z	dgjones	Joelio	Could be that the repo is down at the minute, I'd suggest asking in #ubuntu+1 with you querying about the Alpha version of Hardy
2008-03-13T14:37:00.000Z	Joelio	dgjones	I've just changed my sources to gb.archive.. (it was archive..). Working now.. presume they'll fix upstream
