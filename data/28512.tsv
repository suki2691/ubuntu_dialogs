2010-10-07T03:13:00.000Z	dborba		Kind of a silly question - anyone know how to change the vlc icon in the top panel? the fact that it has a white background has been annoying the s* out of me
2010-10-07T03:14:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	dborba	or do you mean the launcher icon on the upper left ?
2010-10-07T03:23:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	dborba	file a bug report with vlc developers
2010-10-07T03:23:00.000Z	dborba	ilovefairuz	i might - that should really be transparent.
