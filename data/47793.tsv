2010-03-20T08:48:00.000Z	theadmin	ajcarter	Netbeans is a rather cool one, but it's also pretty huge
2010-03-20T08:54:00.000Z	theadmin	ajcarter	Netbeans is just huge, around 200MB. Never tried eclipse, but i'm most certain it's lighter
2010-03-20T09:08:00.000Z	theadmin	ajcarter	Yeah, you can use any "\char" to escape any character basically, (escape means display as character and not as some special mark)
