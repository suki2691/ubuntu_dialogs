2008-04-05T08:01:00.000Z	b4l74z4r		when 8.04 is released, can i just upgrade the beta to the final version or do i have to install it all over again?
2008-04-05T08:02:00.000Z	b4l74z4r		i hope there won't be too many changes from beta to final release, that way i can just keep using the beta
2008-04-05T08:04:00.000Z	b4l74z4r		will there be a list that shows what have been changed/improved in the final release compared to the beta?
