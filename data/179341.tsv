2010-01-30T02:06:00.000Z	jeke		I installed virtualbox-ose then un-installed it and installed virtualbox-3.1 now virtualbox wants me to run a file called /etc/init.d/vboxdrv which doesn't exist
2010-01-30T02:07:00.000Z	jeke		How can I fix this as the virtualbox-3.1 pkg i got from virtualbox.org contains the vboxdrv file
2010-01-30T02:08:00.000Z	jeke		how can i see the contents of a .deb file
2010-01-30T02:09:00.000Z	jrib	jeke	why?
