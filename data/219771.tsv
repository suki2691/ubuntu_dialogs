2006-06-07T09:52:00.000Z	humbolt	Flannel	Yes lots of bug fixes would be cool. An update/bugfix cycle even if there is no security issue.
2006-06-07T09:52:00.000Z	Flannel	humbolt	right, bugfixes will happen throughout support
2006-06-07T09:55:00.000Z	Flannel	humbolt	ubuntu does that to a point.  Like, Dapper was the last of this 'cycle', and as such, the most polished.  Edgy will start another one, and be wild and crazy.
