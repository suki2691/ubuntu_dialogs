2010-07-06T08:11:00.000Z	unclemantis		I have tried everything that I can find on google and I am out of options. I need some help. I am running bootstrap.sh for thrift and I am getting the following error. "configure.ac:44: required file `./ltmain.sh' not found" I am told it is a number of things like missing packages so I install them and again, no luck. Help! Thanks =)

2010-07-06T08:12:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	unclemantis	it's probably not ready for public use
