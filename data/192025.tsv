2006-05-27T09:49:00.000Z	yukonho		Hi everyone, I have a real newbie question about installing 5.10 on a PC that already has Windows ME --- The partitioner in the installation runs into a problem when it is trying to resize the existing partition.  There's about 25GB free on a 40 GB hd, and I'm only trying to resize the partition to 30GB.  Manually editing the partition table doesn't work either.  Should I try this GParted program I've heard about?
