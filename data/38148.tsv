2010-01-29T18:34:00.000Z	stefy		hello! i'm needing help with a potentially damaged disk: the S.M.A.R.T. extended test (id=5) notifies a lot of bad sectors, but trying a bad sectors scan with HDD Regenerator 1.71 from http://www.dposoft.net/ doesn't find any bad sector. should it be a smartd malfunctioning or some other problem? is there a way to recover my hard drive? thank you for your attention.

2010-01-29T18:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	stefy	 you may want to be getting a new hd some time soon just in case.. and of course have backups
2010-01-29T18:37:00.000Z	stefy	Dr_Willis	ok, but my pc is quite new, it's less than 1 year old, do you think it's the time to change the hd?
