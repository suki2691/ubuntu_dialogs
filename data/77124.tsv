2008-10-21T20:01:00.000Z	Rideh		is there a way in ubuntu to specify support to be compiled in when using apt-get - example slapd+openssl
2008-10-21T20:02:00.000Z	Pici	Rideh	No, because apt-get doesn't compile things, it just gets binaries.

2008-10-21T20:03:00.000Z	Pici	Rideh	You could use apt-get source and compile yourself (or use apt-build, but I'm not too familiar with that)
