2009-07-04T19:39:00.000Z	rbanffy		Hi folks. Is there an official, generally accepted, best practice on how to get the wireless of an Acer Aspire One (Atheros AR242x) working with 9.04? I reinstalled and forgot to back-up the modules list. Now I am googling my way to whatever I already did in April that I can't quite remember what it was.
