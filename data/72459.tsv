2009-01-02T00:17:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	mikejet	interesting question. somehow i doubt that blu-ray stuff works in linux at all
2009-01-02T00:17:00.000Z	mikejet	onetinsoldier	thx. i looked at the websites that showed up in google, but blu-ray seems not done yet.
2009-01-02T00:18:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	mikejet	yeah, i think it's because of the DRM stuff
