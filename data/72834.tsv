2008-11-28T06:46:00.000Z	mkerd	KlrSp1	try the latest version of ubuntu
2008-11-28T06:47:00.000Z	KlrSp1	mkerd	nah, i need 8.04 for development consistency reasons
2008-11-28T06:49:00.000Z	mkerd	KlrSp1	snuitje, Oh ok. I don't really know about hibernate, but I think I've read that 8.10 had some improvements in that area. Or maybe it was 9.04 that would get.
