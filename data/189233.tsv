2006-04-27T09:45:00.000Z	UKMatt		hey I have a question for someone about amarok
2006-04-27T09:47:00.000Z	UKMatt		I have all my music saved on an external hard drive (b/c don't wanna save it on both windows and ubuntu side), and I want to be able to make a music library (hopefully in amarok, or another program that lets me) that can use it directly from the external hd
2006-04-27T09:48:00.000Z	UKMatt		does anyone have an idea for me?
