2008-06-01T08:24:00.000Z	babolat		I'm trying to mount an ntfs volume, but I get "Cannot mount the volume | Unable to mount the volume". I've been able to previously mount this same HD once before in this same system. It's an external HD connecting via USB.

2008-06-01T08:27:00.000Z	babolat	harriseldon	i haven't edited fstab yet if that's what you mean. i dunno what to put in
2008-06-01T08:27:00.000Z	harriseldon	babolat	if is is USB you should not need to. Have you tried to mount it from the command line?
