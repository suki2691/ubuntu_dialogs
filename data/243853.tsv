2005-04-03T08:32:00.000Z	mramm		I am having a problem with ndiswrapper and the dell 1170 card in a inspiron 8200 any body got any debugging tips?
2005-04-03T08:33:00.000Z	jk24	mramm	what's the problem ?
2005-04-03T08:35:00.000Z	mramm		I get the drivers installed and ndiswrapper -l shows driver loaded and hardware present.  I did modprobe ndiswrapper, and then ifconfig wlan0 up.  The interface then shows up, but no traffic hits it, and attempts to manually change the essid with iwconfig have no result.
2005-04-03T08:41:00.000Z	mramm	jk24	sorry I had to take a support call.   Any thoughts on how to troubleshoot problems with ndiswrapper
