2006-11-26T09:53:00.000Z	fuffe		I have a question about bugs and ubuntu.. why does bugs on third party apps such as gphpedit turns up in launchpad?
2006-11-26T09:54:00.000Z	fuffe		etc: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/gphpedit/+bug/46487
2006-11-26T09:54:00.000Z	fuffe		gphpedit is developed by the gphpedit team, not by ubuntu, right?
2006-11-26T09:54:00.000Z	Warbo	fuffe	Launchpad can trakc other bug trackers, so that Ubuntu users just have to report all of their bugs to Launchpad and any upstream bugs will be added to the bug report
