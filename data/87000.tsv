2008-06-27T03:54:00.000Z	spoonman	daemon3	take a screenshot of your desktop with the Print Screen key
2008-06-27T03:56:00.000Z	daemon3	spoonman	Why is it necessary to take a screenshot when the terminal's the problem?
2008-06-27T03:56:00.000Z	spoonman	daemon3	it is not necessary. I was just hoping you would let us visualize the problem. Never mind.
