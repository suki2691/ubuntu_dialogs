2006-10-26T10:04:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	AdelaideLuke	Okay, thanks. I don't want to chance it unless it is totally safe, as I would be transferring files from my computer to different computers (running windows) on my network. The people who use them wouldn't be happy if I messed up their HD :-P Thanks.
2006-10-26T10:05:00.000Z	AdelaideLuke	Megaqwerty	Np :)  But again; I had no issues! However; always better to be safe than sorry!
