2008-07-09T07:57:00.000Z	Shoopuf		The "hp-toolbox" command in terminal won't run because it says "PyQt not installed. GUI not available." ...But I wasn't sure which file should I install from repository??
2008-07-09T07:58:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	Shoopuf	apt-cache search pyqt
2008-07-09T07:59:00.000Z	Shoopuf	hiptobecubic	Should I get python-qt3, python-qt4?
2008-07-09T08:00:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	Shoopuf	i don't really know. try the newer one first i guess? although it probably would hurt to do them both
