2010-02-17T08:55:00.000Z	felinethropist		can somebody please answer my question?  I am trying to install KVM. but the command egrep '(vmx|svm)' --color=always /proc/cpuinfo does not return anything. So does that mean that I cannot run KVM at all or there is something I need to change somewhere?

2010-02-17T08:56:00.000Z	freetown2	felinethropist	sorry, Intel removed/disabled/whatever hardware virtualization from most products in that line
