2012-07-16T01:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jericom	 where did these video files come from?
2012-07-16T01:37:00.000Z	jericom	Dr_Willis	Audio is ok, video is not working
2012-07-16T01:39:00.000Z	jericom	Dr_Willis	I wanted to view the video in Ubuntu not in a Windows VM.
2012-07-16T01:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jericom	 its possible ffmpeg, or mencoder, or somthing might be able to convert it...
