2008-09-05T15:07:00.000Z	sinan		there is something i don't understand. Doesn't X start before i login? How is it supposed to know what .xinitrc file to read, supposing i put it in my home folder?
2008-09-05T15:08:00.000Z	favro	sinan	afaik X starts after you login
2008-09-05T15:09:00.000Z	sinan	favro	how does the gdmgreeter render, then? (i am actually asking :) )
