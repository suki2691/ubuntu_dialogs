2011-06-01T12:29:00.000Z	EastDallas		Does anyone know how I can disable the screenshot when you hit "print Screen"?
2011-06-01T12:30:00.000Z	EastDallas		My backspace and print screen keys are much too close together, and I keep creating screenshots, or at least getting the dialogue
2011-06-01T12:31:00.000Z	Dulak	EastDallas	should be able to disable the key combo in system->preferences->keyboard shortcuts
