2011-05-01T17:05:00.000Z	Daniel0108		I have a problem, I can't connect to another IRC network with my client. Only freenode works. If I connect over webchat, it also works. I think there's a firewall running, but I don't know which firewall is still running, I disabled firestarter :/
2011-05-01T17:06:00.000Z	BlouBlou	Daniel0108	which error are you getting?
2011-05-01T17:06:00.000Z	Daniel0108	BlouBlou	I can connect to the server, but I get no response from it, I'm online, but I don't get server responses, it's a one-way connection
