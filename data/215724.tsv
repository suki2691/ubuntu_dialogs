2008-02-26T22:48:00.000Z	osfameron		aha!  I can, but the interface is amazingly stupid and just shows 2x "open synaptic" options, without distinguishing them.

2008-02-26T22:50:00.000Z	osfameron	soundray	yeah.  It looks like one of the deskbar options does indeed do that though.  (I remember I could never get katapult to play nice with gksudo on a previous install)
