2007-07-22T05:41:00.000Z	ShackJack	abstrakt	You can check version #'s in Synaptic...
2007-07-22T05:42:00.000Z	abstrakt	ShackJack	... er, so the multiverse variant wouldn't include any different plugins, just different versions?
2007-07-22T05:43:00.000Z	ShackJack	abstrakt	Well it might have extra codec support, but you'd have to check changelog for that... generally multiverse will be newer version....
