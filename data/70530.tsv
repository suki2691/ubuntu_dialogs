2010-06-20T22:38:00.000Z	K-rAd-		i'm doing backup from my ubuntu drive to my windows drive using correctly configured samba and backintime-gnome.  its somewhat slow, and definitely a resource hog.  can't listen to music while its transferring.  i could invest on online storage solutions does anyone know how much amazon cloud services would cost for 600GB of data to back, and say, differrential updates twice a week ?
