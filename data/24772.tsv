2010-11-11T20:03:00.000Z	goltoof	adammw111	  what on earth are you doing mixing xp and linux partitions?
2010-11-11T20:28:00.000Z	goltoof	adammw111	    i'm just curious... have  you found anyone here who has any idea what you're talking about or trying to accomplish?
2010-11-11T20:29:00.000Z	adammw111	goltoof	some people have some ideas here and there. so it *is* actually helping. i think i just keep changing my mind too much or finding new problems
