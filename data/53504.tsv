2011-10-14T20:16:00.000Z	serengeti		hello :) I've installed gnome shell in oneiric and everything works well, apart from one thing: when I browse applications in the overlay, most apps are duplicated. For example, there are 2 entries for Firefox, one with a nice icon from the icon from the icon theme, and the other with some low-res image. Any ideas?
