2007-09-20T05:39:00.000Z	Pici	marcus	Because its too much of a change to backport to feisty.  It is standard in Gutsy (which is the next version, releasing in October)
2007-09-20T05:39:00.000Z	marcus		Ohhh
2007-09-20T05:39:00.000Z	marcus	Pici	- Ok, because I was about to say "Hopefully it'll be on Gutsy" but then you said "It won't" and I took it as "ever."  :P
