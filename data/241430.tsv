2007-10-27T01:25:00.000Z	pjz		anyone know if the ati drivers released yesterday will make it into a gutsy update?
2007-10-27T01:25:00.000Z	Rubin	pjz	generally once a release goes out, only security fixes and bugs get fixed. you may have to wait for 8.04 for that
2007-10-27T01:27:00.000Z	pjz	Rubin	augh. 6 months to get hat in? ick.
2007-10-27T01:28:00.000Z	Rubin	pjz	or you can run the devel version...
