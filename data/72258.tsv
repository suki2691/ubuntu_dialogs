2008-12-03T12:12:00.000Z	Theeb_		when will the OpenOffice 3 be available in ubuntu 8.10
2008-12-03T12:12:00.000Z	Flannel	Theeb_	It will never be officially included.  But backports should have it sometime in the near future
2008-12-03T12:14:00.000Z	Theeb_	Flannel	2.4 is included, why not 3?
2008-12-03T12:14:00.000Z	Flannel	Theeb_	Because OOo 3 was released too late in Intrepids cycle (it was postponed a few times)
