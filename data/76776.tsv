2008-10-22T20:12:00.000Z	Ohmu_		just tried to watch a movie off my external HDD.  In ubuntu, it won't play the voices-audio.  (it's a japanese animation.. I guess the voiceover is on a different track, and the player cant handle this).  So swapped to my housemates mac.  It wont even see the hdd.  So  we boot up the windows box.  Good ole windows.  And it doesn't have the codec.  And I can't get either the mac or hte xp box online, as wifi access point is mission impossible.  LOL technology!
2008-10-22T20:13:00.000Z	Ohmu_		really, how can I fix the ubuntu problem?  And the audio level is so low despite player level and syslevel being on max.  can anyone help?
