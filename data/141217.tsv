2012-11-25T05:19:00.000Z	johnh		hello, i have a problem with booting ubuntu from a usb stick which appears to be full - is there a way i can remove files from the command line ?
2012-11-25T05:20:00.000Z	usr13	johnh	Yes, rm /path/to/file
2012-11-25T05:21:00.000Z	johnh	usr13	there is not a specific file which i need to delete - it's more removing tmp files
2012-11-25T05:29:00.000Z	usr13	johnh	Just delete some stuff in /media/disk/tmp  is all I know....
