2011-09-01T18:55:00.000Z	CluelessPerson	kion	  The key ring password is very different
2011-09-01T18:56:00.000Z	CluelessPerson	kion	 The password is the password to the user long, the keyring password is basically a password for access to ALL other saved passwords
2011-09-01T18:57:00.000Z	kion	CluelessPerson	yes but why my box never asks for the keyring password and another also asks for that keyring one?
