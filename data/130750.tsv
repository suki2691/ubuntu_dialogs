2007-07-08T06:58:00.000Z	Ricket		Help! My second core is stuck at full 2ghz after a resume from suspend! It's supposed to idle at 1ghz and then only jump to 2ghz on demand but it is stuck...

2007-07-08T06:59:00.000Z	Ricket	unagi	are you using nvidia or nvidia-new? I had trouble with the regular nvidia driver, but after upgrading to nvidia-new and changing some acpi-support settings I got suspend partially working... I'm still fixing some things about it though, such as being able to suspend more than once without crashing... But at least is suspends once!
