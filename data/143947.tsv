2008-11-05T18:25:00.000Z	Slartibartfast	AdvoWork	I suggest you install mplayer/gmplayer which supports many other formats
2008-11-05T18:26:00.000Z	AdvoWork	Slartibartfast	 but its only a .mp3.. how come it wont play that? and ikonia  i dunno, i just installed the program itself
2008-11-05T18:26:00.000Z	Slartibartfast	AdvoWork	then sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
