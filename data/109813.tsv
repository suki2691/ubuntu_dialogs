2011-11-03T11:54:00.000Z	Kapoeira		Hmmm ... i just installed libcurl with sudo apt-get install php-curl ... but apt gives me a list of packets « that have been automatically installed and are no longer necessary » .... Is it really SAFE to remove them ?

2011-11-03T11:55:00.000Z	soreau	Kapoeira	Typically it's always safe to remove them
