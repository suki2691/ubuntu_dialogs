2011-01-25T04:30:00.000Z	jsec		Has anyone had any luck with fglrx and 10.10? I've finally backed everything up should something go awry, but I'm feeling uneasy about this.

2011-01-25T04:39:00.000Z	jsec	eipi-1	no, not yet. i'm researching whether fglrx is going to bomb my system or not. I'll try it later. Thanks for the heads up.
