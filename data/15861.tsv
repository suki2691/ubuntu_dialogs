2011-06-23T03:25:00.000Z	Sovek		Hey Everyone, slight issue. I'm wanting to try another distro based off of natty, and the USB disk creator sees the ISO, and made a boot drive, but when I tried to boot, nothing, says something about not being a boot disk or something
2011-06-23T03:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	Sovek	 theres been some bugs with the usb-disk creator tool goofing up the sysconfig menus. You may want to try one of the tools from pendrivelinux web site.
