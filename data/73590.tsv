2011-01-06T01:47:00.000Z	TeslaTony		I'm trying to create a disk image of both my Linux and Windows partitions. I tried dd, but it's slow and I can't tell if it's doing a recursive backup or not. Any recommended utilities?
2011-01-06T01:47:00.000Z	pepee	TeslaTony	cp /dev/sda ?
2011-01-06T01:48:00.000Z	TeslaTony	pepee	Will that keep the partitions and filesystems intact?
2011-01-06T01:49:00.000Z	pepee	TeslaTony	well, don't really know if that will work...
