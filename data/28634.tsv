2012-02-24T06:55:00.000Z	__name__		Is there any better way to have *good* powersave on my laptop than patching powertop to generate a script that disables the webcam, sets USB &c to powersave, disables the fingerprint sensor, etc?
2012-02-24T06:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	__name__	do you use the fingerprint sensor?
2012-02-24T06:57:00.000Z	__name__	ActionParsnip	Nah, that's why I disable it.
