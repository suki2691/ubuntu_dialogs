2008-01-05T06:11:00.000Z	FastZ		I've run into some problems.  I just installed Madwifi-ng on my toshiba satellite and i have a perfect wireless connection with these drivers.  I have an Atheros AR5006EG (so lspci says) wireless adapter (built-in).  My problem is that I have kismet installed on this laptop but when I run sudo kismet, i'm told the following: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d55246789  IFCONFIG shows eth0, lo, and wlan0
