2009-06-30T03:09:00.000Z	UbNoob	mdm	 yes.  sorry...I'm obviously a noob and don't know the correct terms.
2009-06-30T03:10:00.000Z	mdm	UbNoob	thats only because there is more then one shell.  Presuming you are using bash or dash go to GNU (the ones who created it) http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html
