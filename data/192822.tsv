2008-07-15T03:08:00.000Z	Scunizi		Strange.. I connect my new Nikon D60 and the camera import wizard opens and allows me to import the pic to Fspot. However I can't find the camera as a mounted device that I can just drag and drop from.  Any suggestions?
2008-07-15T03:09:00.000Z	MrCollins	Scunizi	you need to mount the camera as a drive
2008-07-15T03:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	MrCollins	my other digital mounts automatically.. Maybe this camera is just seen differently. I can't find it using "sudo fdisk -l".. do you know another way?
2008-07-15T03:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	MrCollins	also isn't it already mounted to give fspot the ability to import directly?
