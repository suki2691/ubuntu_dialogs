2009-04-08T09:35:00.000Z	pr0t0c0n		i have a question , is it possible to run multiple programs while in console mode
2009-04-08T09:35:00.000Z	stealth-_	pr0t0c0n	console mode? you mean no GUI?
2009-04-08T09:36:00.000Z	stealth-_	pr0t0c0n	then yes, just move over to a different terminal or use screen. ctrl+alt+F# where # is a terminal number
2009-04-08T09:36:00.000Z	stealth-_	pr0t0c0n	id advise using different terminals though, screen is a bit harder to figure out
