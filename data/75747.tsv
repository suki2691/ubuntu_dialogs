2008-11-02T08:52:00.000Z	billygalbreath	spiritssight1	use ftp, sftp, or nfs
2008-11-02T08:54:00.000Z	spiritssight1	rdw200169	 can you explain more please, both system is on the same network (router)
2008-11-02T08:55:00.000Z	billygalbreath	spiritssight1	my favorite method is nfs as i can mount network shares from one box to another - quick and easy as pie - best solution if you plan to transfer files a lot (i.e., not a one time deal)
