2008-08-13T20:21:00.000Z	deep_blue		this can be a silly question, since I'm not a linux user until yesterday when I was referred to use Uunbunt......which "partition file system" does Ubuntu use?
2008-08-13T20:22:00.000Z	deep_blue		redwing, lollydays, powergoal2......thanks guys......but what is ext3.....i know FAT16, FAT32 and NTFS
2008-08-13T20:24:00.000Z	deep_blue		I need to partition my USB pendrive (which I have never done in pendrive)..so i'm somewhat confused......how should i get it partition so that I can use ubuntu in it.......as well as a storage place for some windows files
2008-08-13T20:24:00.000Z	DM|	deep_blue	use fat32 that way it can be read and write from both windows and linux
