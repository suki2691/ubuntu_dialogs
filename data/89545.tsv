2010-04-03T00:11:00.000Z	robertzaccour		my wireless stopped working. i tried to connect to it from the list again, and it wouldn't connect. then i restarted, didn't work. updated, didn't work. i checked the hardware drivers from the systems menu, it says its active, but its not in the list in the upper right. then i tried removing and reactivating, that didn't work. any ideas?

2010-04-03T00:12:00.000Z	robertzaccour	BlueEagle	no. how do i do that?
