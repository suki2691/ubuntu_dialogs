2012-01-15T20:42:00.000Z	openSSO		Repeating: I need help uninstalling ITALC completely. Everytime I try to I still get error libItalcCore.so missing when trying to run ITALC. This started after attempting to install from source (it didn't apparently give any build errors though)
2012-01-15T20:44:00.000Z	openSSO		...are there any specific directories I can completely remove that would contain anything ITALC that may be left on the system after uninstallation?
