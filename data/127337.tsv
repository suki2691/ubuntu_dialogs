2007-07-22T15:04:00.000Z	ccherrett		I am trying to install qsampler that requires qtdir to be set. I set qtdir to /usr/share/qt4 but it is complaining it must have qt3 >= 3.1.1
2007-07-22T15:05:00.000Z	tetonca	ccherrett	maybe libqt
2007-07-22T15:05:00.000Z	ccherrett	tetonca	I have installed every qt header and source I could find
2007-07-22T15:06:00.000Z	tetonca	ccherrett	there were licencing issues wrt qt but I thot they made friends with purists a while ago.
