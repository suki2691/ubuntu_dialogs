2009-05-05T16:56:00.000Z	Radtoo	peppot	"screen" lets you have many "consoles" in one session, but perhaps alt-f2 also works to switch to another terminal?
2009-05-05T16:57:00.000Z	peppot	Radtoo	it only opens one by default
2009-05-05T16:57:00.000Z	peppot	Radtoo	need to have many to paste across etc
