2008-02-16T12:34:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		I've been using a USB mouse on my laptop, I disabled my touchpad with a button above it, but when I switched it back on I lost control over configuring it (if I disable "tap to click" it doesn't work)
2008-02-16T12:34:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		anyone have nay ideas? Do you tihnk a simple reboot would help?
