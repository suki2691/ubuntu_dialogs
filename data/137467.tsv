2007-04-21T11:15:00.000Z	Ringo		I tried to upgrade to v7.04 using the package manager and it tells me I dont have enought room in my /boot partition .. any way to expand it ?
2007-04-21T11:15:00.000Z	Ringo		did that
2007-04-21T11:15:00.000Z	Ringo		only one kernel left
2007-04-21T11:15:00.000Z	|ringo|	Ringo	before trying to resize you could delete older version numbered kernels
