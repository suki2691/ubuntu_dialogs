2010-04-18T08:20:00.000Z	emendo	bubulein	I just updated to 2.6.33 kernel and I am using an Intel Mac with ubuntu 10.04 running native. I upgraded because the new kernel has sound working for the imac (at least through headphones). Once the kernel was updated to 2.6.33 the proprietary NVIDIA graphics driver which I had activated through systems -> administration -> hardware drivers is now inactive and will not work. systems -> administration -> hardware drivers
