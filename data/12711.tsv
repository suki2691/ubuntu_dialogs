2011-07-04T19:26:00.000Z	soscrewed	sudokill	i dont have a bad disk. i accidentally formated the wrong device. recovered the boot sector. tried to mount. it said invalid access to fat. now i am in fsck.msdos and it says truncating file to 0 bytes
2011-07-04T19:28:00.000Z	sudokill	soscrewed	theres a program called photorec thats supposed to recover files, its included with the partedmagic livecd you could try that
