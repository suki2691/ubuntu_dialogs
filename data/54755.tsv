2009-06-09T17:49:00.000Z	cankoy	eBug	sudo apt-get -f install
2009-06-09T17:50:00.000Z	eBug	cankoy	apt-get -f install doesn't fix nothing (i.e. there's no problem)
2009-06-09T18:05:00.000Z	cankoy	eBug	try command line upgrade (network upgrade for servers) on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/JauntyUpgrades
