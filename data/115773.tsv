2008-05-09T06:00:00.000Z	zcat[1]	jakamo	and I find samba works pretty well, better than nfs last time I tried it
2008-05-09T06:01:00.000Z	jakamo	zcat[1]	true but sshfs works on any system you have an ssh account with, and can be used with windows if you install cygwin.  Since ditching samba for sshfs all my problems with permissions, etc have gone away.
2008-05-09T06:08:00.000Z	jakamo	zcat[1]	Windows can do nfs through cygwin.  Anyone with the smarts to get into linux can put cygwin on Windows.
