2008-03-25T07:41:00.000Z	yn		Hi. I am having difficulty using dpkg-divert to resolve a conflict. I am using Envy to install the latest ati catalyst drivers on 64-bit Ubuntu. When I run envy, it tries to install the package that it just built, and can't install it because there is a conflict with /usr/lib32/libGL.so.1, which is also provided by ia32-libs
2008-03-25T07:43:00.000Z	yn		ok, forget about the fact that I am using envy. Can someone explain just how to use dpkg-divert in my situation?
