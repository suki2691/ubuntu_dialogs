2012-09-26T21:52:00.000Z	Spoils		I am using Ubuntu 12.04, my top panel (the one with the clock and battery indicator) has disappeared...
2012-09-26T21:52:00.000Z	Spoils		Does anyone have an idea about how to re enable it?
2012-09-26T21:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spoils	if you log off and on, is it ok?
