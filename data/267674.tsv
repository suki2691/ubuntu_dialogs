2010-08-30T02:07:00.000Z	alpharesearch		I want to find the package that includes hhp2cached from wxwidgets, I guessed this command would help: dpkg-query -S hhp2cached (but there are findings)
2010-08-30T02:08:00.000Z	alpharesearch		Is there a better command to find what package includes what binary?
