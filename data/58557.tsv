2009-09-22T00:11:00.000Z	ekneuss		Hi, I'm looking for a way to install java in a ubuntu server I'm supposed to maintain, apt-get install sun-java6-jdk errors out saying that the package is not found
2009-09-22T00:12:00.000Z	ekneuss		I did a apt-get update already
2009-09-22T00:12:00.000Z	ekneuss		any idea?
2009-09-22T00:12:00.000Z	Darael	ekneuss	You could use openjdk?
