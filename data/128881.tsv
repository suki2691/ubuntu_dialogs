2008-03-29T05:46:00.000Z	FFVV		Can anyone help me? been editing the oidentd config to get it working as I want but now I need to restart it, how do I do it? sorry but im clueless with that
2008-03-29T05:48:00.000Z	leo_rockw	FFVV	i'm not sure what oidentd is but try sudo /etc/init.d/oidentd restart
2008-03-29T05:49:00.000Z	leo_rockw	FFVV	did that work? kool
2008-03-29T05:49:00.000Z	leo_rockw	FFVV	i just figured oidentd was a daemon (most daemons end with a d)
