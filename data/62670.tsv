2009-08-10T11:33:00.000Z	iceroot	savanny1976u	both a bad, because the real config is done with ssh + vi. sometims a gui cant admin everything (or is overwriting something existing)
2009-08-10T11:33:00.000Z	iceroot	savanny1976u	but if it must be a gui, then webmin is ok
2009-08-10T11:33:00.000Z	iceroot	savanny1976u	ok, its not...
