2007-10-16T10:37:00.000Z	Innomen	Pricey	so when i'm attacked, i'm to blame. isnt that kinda like "she was asking for it" ? sad. Are you a moderator?
2007-10-16T10:40:00.000Z	Pricey	Innomen	sorry I was away for a second. Yes I am an operator of the channel, would you like to chat with me about this in pm?
2007-10-16T10:41:00.000Z	Innomen	Pricey	i'd rather they get off my back, and i'd like to have my comments public, for the record. But I'm flexible.
