2012-02-15T02:37:00.000Z	theadmin	mkjackson_mobile	Seems correct to me
2012-02-15T02:37:00.000Z	mkjackson_mobile	theadmin	strangely enough, it returns all the lines as if I didn't grep at all
2012-02-15T02:38:00.000Z	theadmin	mkjackson_mobile	Hm. Maybe "service --status-all" doesn't print to stdout? Try something like... this: service --status-all 2>&1 | grep network-manager
