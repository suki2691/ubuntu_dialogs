2010-04-09T22:09:00.000Z	obiwan_	Curly_Q	when i press the raise / lower sound keys, the sound is emitted by ubuntu not by the bios
2010-04-09T22:16:00.000Z	obiwan_	Curly_Q	i get the sound from my speakers when i'm using the speakrs. when i'm on my headphones, i get the sound from my headphones. I remember when i had a pc tower, the bios sounds were emitted from the inside, not from speakers/headphones. So i think it comes from ubuntu, not the motherboard
2010-04-09T22:17:00.000Z	obiwan_	Curly_Q	so you know any way to disable that sound? i completely disabled the "ubuntu sounds" in the sound preferences but sitll get that
