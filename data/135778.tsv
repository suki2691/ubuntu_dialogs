2007-04-30T11:32:00.000Z	jackb		I'm back! Good news and bad
2007-04-30T11:32:00.000Z	jackb		putting the disc into the DVD drive worked, I got the ubuntu screen and it seems to read the disc
2007-04-30T11:33:00.000Z	jackb		however when I checked Start and install it goes to the black screen with ubuntu and the status bar going back and forth for a long time, then I just get a cursur in the top left corner and had to reboot
2007-04-30T11:33:00.000Z	VXC001A	jackb	what's the bad news?
