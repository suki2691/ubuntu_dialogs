2006-03-12T09:55:00.000Z	jeff2		does Ubuntu come with scanner support by default, or do I have to build the scanner kernel module myself?
2006-03-12T09:56:00.000Z	tritium	jeff2	at least some are supported by default
2006-03-12T09:56:00.000Z	jeff2	tritium	it seems the "scanner" module isn't installed (lsmod), do some scanners require it and some not?
2006-03-12T09:57:00.000Z	tritium	jeff2	not sure
