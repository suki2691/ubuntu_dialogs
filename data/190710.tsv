2006-07-18T09:40:00.000Z	kilai		I've been wanting to install linux for years but never really bothered, I tried the Ubuntu live cd the other day and Now I'm definatly gonna install it
2006-07-18T09:40:00.000Z	kilai		when I boot off the live cd and click the installation button on the desktop, where will it install linux to? I have a 200gb hd with several partitions
