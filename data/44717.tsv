2009-11-05T04:42:00.000Z	simon__		Let me try again: I am on a USB wireless adapter, specifically a Belkin F5D8053n. I think it is using the ralink driver. I am having trouble connecting to my WPA-protected wireless network. The password I enter works in Windows, but the Network Manager appears to try to connect, but eventually just re-prompts for the WPA.

2009-11-05T04:43:00.000Z	simon__	MixMix	its all numbers...
2009-11-05T04:44:00.000Z	MixMix	simon__	have you selected the right type of encryption wpa/wep?
