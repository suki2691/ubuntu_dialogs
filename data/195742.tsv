2006-11-10T08:29:00.000Z	Kaiyang		ok- For a beginner If i need to set up a server. Which should I use? DESKTOP or SERVER EDITION? I am poor in using console based unless it's dead easy
2006-11-10T08:30:00.000Z	Kaiyang		Can DESKTOP EDITION work the same as SERVER Edition?
2006-11-10T08:31:00.000Z	kitche	Kaiyang	you can install a desktop later on the server if you wish
2006-11-10T08:33:00.000Z	kitche	Kaiyang	nothing really just that server is a bare system pretty much
