2012-01-15T20:30:00.000Z	QuantumQuanta		I'm trying to install eclipse on 11.10 using "sudo apt-get install eclipse" but I keep getting errors that I'm not sure how to fix: http://paste.ubuntu.com/805216/
2012-01-15T20:31:00.000Z	qmr	QuantumQuanta	I recommend installing eclipse from eclipse's website
2012-01-15T20:31:00.000Z	QuantumQuanta	qmr	not to sound like a baby, but why?
2012-01-15T20:32:00.000Z	qmr	QuantumQuanta	newer version.  last I looked the one in ubuntu was rather old.  once you install it it's self updating though.  I just have mine in ~/eclipse/
