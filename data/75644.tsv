2008-11-03T04:53:00.000Z	vt		it's the first time I use Ubuntu, my friend gave me his old computer with it installed. do someone already experienced slowness with Radeon 9250 and "radeon" driver at 1024*768 ? (the fglrx driver gave me a fast 800x600)
2008-11-03T04:54:00.000Z	spanther	vt	amd graphics cards have known issues with driver :)
2008-11-03T04:55:00.000Z	vt	spanther	I read a bit yes. But I thought that the open-source driver was at least okay for basic 2D web-browsing :)
2008-11-03T04:56:00.000Z	spanther	vt	well it depends on the used card :/ otherwise you have to use vesa
