2006-12-27T17:21:00.000Z	Slart	finalbeta	oh, I've done that.. I can use the drive.. but I have to go through filesystem, media, sdd3.. the other drives I can just select directly from the places-tab
2006-12-27T17:21:00.000Z	Slart	finalbeta	can I edit the list manually? until feisty is available
2006-12-27T17:22:00.000Z	finalbeta	Slart	 not sure, but go to the drive with nautilus, and then add a bookmark. That place should then be added to that list I think.
