2011-11-09T02:08:00.000Z	jeff_ubuntu		 Should I install the ATI driver from the website or should I install it from the Additional Drivers? I know how to install both, I just want to know which would be better performance wise
2011-11-09T02:08:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	jeff_ubuntu	neither, unless you're experiencing any difficulties
2011-11-09T02:09:00.000Z	jeff_ubuntu	jo-erlend_	I am like 3d effects are lagging etc, so I need to install one of them
2011-11-09T02:09:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	jeff_ubuntu	well... But the official drivers have issues of their own.
