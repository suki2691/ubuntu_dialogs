2012-01-13T00:05:00.000Z	Odaym		if I do "dmesg | grep ipsec" and don't get any output, does that mean that I don't have it installed?
2012-01-13T00:06:00.000Z	Odaym		I have a link that says it ships with full kernel integration
2012-01-13T00:06:00.000Z	theadmin	Odaym	Might want to grep -i just in case it shows up as "IPSec" or something like that in dmesg
