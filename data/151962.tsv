2007-01-24T13:19:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Tsool	/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2007-01-24T13:21:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Tsool	modprobe -l will list all the driver modules the kernel knows about, and that list is set by doing depmod -ae
2007-01-24T13:21:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Tsool	There are other files in /etc/modprobe.d/ such as 'whitelist' and 'aliases'
