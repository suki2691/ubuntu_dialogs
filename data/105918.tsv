2009-10-20T23:43:00.000Z	Glowball		Well, I can better ask it straight away: does anybody know how well Ubuntu is translated to Dutch? I'm thinking of using it instead of the English version, but I can't stand bad translations...
2009-10-20T23:44:00.000Z	Glowball		Ah, ok
2009-10-20T23:44:00.000Z	Bodsda	Glowball	try asking in #ubuntu-nl
