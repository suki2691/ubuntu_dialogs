2006-09-27T10:30:00.000Z	Sivik	ks1	but i don't think he understand correctly
2006-09-27T10:31:00.000Z	ks1	Sivik	he meant like kernel version 4.0 was out. He wants that because it is newer than say 2.6; 4.0 > 2.0
2006-09-27T10:32:00.000Z	Sivik	ks1	i didn't know they had different numbers to help describe them, i'm sorry
