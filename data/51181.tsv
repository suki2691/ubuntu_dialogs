2012-10-25T03:53:00.000Z	h6w		Hi.  How do I report an ubuntu bug now?   Clicking on "report a bug" on launchpad keeps sending me to a "Bug reporting etiquette" page on ubuntu.com
2012-10-25T03:55:00.000Z	trism	h6w	ubuntu-bug package_name; or read the bug reporting page to see other options
2012-10-25T03:56:00.000Z	h6w	trism	Yeah.  This is an upgrading bug, tho.  So what package would that be?
2012-10-25T04:00:00.000Z	trism	h6w	ubuntu-bug update-manager; I would guess, it can be reassigned later
