2012-02-13T04:20:00.000Z	Detergentizer	cfhowlett	 ok, thanks
2012-02-13T04:20:00.000Z	Detergentizer	cfhowlett	 but it is still there
2012-02-13T04:20:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Detergentizer	sorry then IDK.  I'm in Ubuntu Studio 10.04 and will be going to XFCE with 12.04 - my unity exposure is minimal.  Ask the channel again.
