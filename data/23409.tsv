2010-10-28T08:44:00.000Z	javatexan		hey guys, I am trying to make a virtual machine out of a running ubuntu box, then reinstall the box as a virtual machine box and put the ubuntu vm back on it.... anyone had success doing this?  The ubuntu machine does have some databases running on it so I am not sure if a tar of / will work.  Any ideas?  Thanks.
