2009-11-01T23:56:00.000Z	dli	Psinetic	even though you may set tunnel VPN through ssh, it's much simpler to do it within openVPN: sudo apt-get install openvpn
2009-11-01T23:58:00.000Z	Psinetic	dli	i installed openvpn, now what?
2009-11-02T00:03:00.000Z	Psinetic	dli	would i be able to use my VPS for the VPN?
