2006-08-24T13:02:00.000Z	Don_jr	GUIPEnguin_	yes, it did the same thing to me, so I got the text based installer
2006-08-24T13:03:00.000Z	GUIPEnguin_	Don_jr	thanks...I normaly do tex-based installs (gentoo) but I thought I would try the ubuntu gui installer...I didnt think it would be this crappy
2006-08-24T13:03:00.000Z	Don_jr	GUIPEnguin_	yeah, I had some pretty major problems with it last night myself so decided to go the other way, it's worth it
