2007-11-29T14:27:00.000Z	deal_		I've just downloaded a episode of Dexter. And the file is packed in several rar files, *.r00-*.r23. I've installed unrar-free, and did a 'unrar-free dexter.*.r00' and got Failed. Same when I tryed it with unrar-free dexter.*.rar
2007-11-29T14:27:00.000Z	deal_		Anyone can tell me what else I might try ?
2007-11-29T14:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	deal_	unrar x file.rar (x for extract)
2007-11-29T14:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	deal_	;P no problem
