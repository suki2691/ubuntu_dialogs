2009-10-31T20:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Shockrates	a new OS comes out every six months, doesn't necessarioly mean all the software is new, but usually at least some of it is
2009-10-31T20:51:00.000Z	Shockrates	IndyGunFreak	i have heard that if a new version of lets say a math sofware comes availabe i cant use it, until 6 months have passed
2009-10-31T20:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Shockrates	i dont know why that would be, you can use it as long as you have it installed
