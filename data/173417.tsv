2009-04-10T22:56:00.000Z	cmumanz		Can anyone please help me find information about manual partitioning and making filesystems? I need to format an ext3 partition with an inode size of 128
2009-04-10T22:57:00.000Z	cmumanz		already tried gparted
2009-04-10T22:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cmumanz	 Ext4 round the corner in 9.04
2009-04-10T22:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cmumanz	so doing loads of stuff now with Ext3, is probably a bit pointless
