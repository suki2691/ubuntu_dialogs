2009-01-07T01:47:00.000Z	Agent_AL		hello, could someone suggest image viewer that supports animated gif animations playback? Except for Firefox I couldn't find any

2009-01-07T01:48:00.000Z	Agent_AL	ASULutzy	it's not so fast as typical image viewer
2009-01-07T01:49:00.000Z	Agent_AL	ASULutzy	Firefox is much faster to preview gifs but it's not so functional as image viewer
