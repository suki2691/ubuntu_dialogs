2010-12-27T21:16:00.000Z	SirShmoopy		is it a general problem with 10.10, or somehting silly with my machine. menus have a way of not popping up sometimes unless i mouse over a few times
2010-12-27T21:17:00.000Z	compdoc	SirShmoopy	you think the machine is too busy?
2010-12-27T21:18:00.000Z	SirShmoopy	compdoc	no, it happens even when i only have a few apps running. but i dont remember it being a problem 10.04-down
