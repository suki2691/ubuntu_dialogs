2011-08-07T19:01:00.000Z	SantiG		hey guys, is there a way to uninstall ubuntu from my computer? I have my disk partitioned with windows and ubuntu, and i was wondering if i could delete ubuntu without having to format the whole disk

2011-08-07T19:03:00.000Z	compdoc`	SantiG	does it boot grub?
2011-08-07T19:04:00.000Z	compdoc`	SantiG	when it boots, do you get a menu with a choice between ubuntu and windows?
