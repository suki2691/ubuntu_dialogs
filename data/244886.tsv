2006-03-09T08:32:00.000Z	viyyer		hi why is the m17n-db package in breezy/dapper older that the one in debian testing/unstable??
2006-03-09T08:33:00.000Z	topyli	viyyer	ubuntu developers freeze unstable at some point. the versions are pretty much from that time
2006-03-09T08:34:00.000Z	topyli	viyyer	i don't know if dapper is completely frozen yet though. i guess it's stablilizing now and won't change too much
2006-03-09T08:35:00.000Z	viyyer	topyli	what is the freeze date for dapper..
