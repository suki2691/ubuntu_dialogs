2012-10-25T23:59:00.000Z	lion42	GeorgeTorwell	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_%28Linux%29 and yes, afaik.
2012-10-25T23:59:00.000Z	GeorgeTorwell	lion42	the ubuntu installer lets you select full disk encryption without also having to select USE LVM
2012-10-26T00:01:00.000Z	lion42	GeorgeTorwell	oh, perhaps that's the most recent one (which I don't run.) I have given you mistaken information. The only way I have set up fully encrypted ubuntu is with an LVM.
