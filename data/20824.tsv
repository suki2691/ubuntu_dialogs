2011-09-01T18:29:00.000Z	delac		any way to grab screenshot of window that spans over multiple desktops?
2011-09-01T18:30:00.000Z	BarkingFish	delac	- the only way would be to take a screenshot of each desktop in turn and put them together in something like gimp.
2011-09-01T18:31:00.000Z	BarkingFish		I'm not aware of a screencapture facility which can cross desktops to get a multi screen window
2011-09-01T18:31:00.000Z	delac	BarkingFish	I was trying to avoid the stiching by taking one big screenshot in the first place...
