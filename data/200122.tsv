2009-02-09T23:42:00.000Z	nanotube	dixon208	kde 4.2 is not in the official ubuntu repos for 8.10, since it was released just recently.
2009-02-09T23:42:00.000Z	nanotube	dixon208	you may be able to find a third-party repository that hosts kde4.2 packages for ubuntu 8.10, though.
2009-02-09T23:43:00.000Z	nanotube	dixon208	google around, i can't give you a specific link off the top of my head...
