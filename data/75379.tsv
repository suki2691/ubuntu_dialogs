2009-02-01T08:42:00.000Z	Out_Cold		when i put in a usb drive it says i'm not privlidged to mount it. i tried running sudo mount /dev/usb with no results.
2009-02-01T08:44:00.000Z	Out_Cold		can someone help me figure out why i'm not privileged enough to mount usb sticks?
2009-02-01T08:45:00.000Z	redvamp128	Out_Cold	 What is the file system- ntfs? and normally with my Ubuntu I stick a stick in and it automounts it
2009-02-01T08:46:00.000Z	Out_Cold	redvamp128	I tried with a few different file systems, currently i believe it's fat32 and it did use to automount, not anymore
