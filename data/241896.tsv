2007-10-03T06:06:00.000Z	BlackCow		ok so i dont know if anyone remembers my earlyer problem but this is how it stands, ubuntu server edition 7.04 can see my DFE-530TX+, the eathernet connection works on a lap top, but the computer isnt showing up on my network nor can it ping anything internally or externally
2007-10-03T06:06:00.000Z	BlackCow		where do I go from here
2007-10-03T06:07:00.000Z	astro76	BlackCow	what do you mean it works on a laptop? ubuntu server is installed on a regular machine?
2007-10-03T06:09:00.000Z	astro76	BlackCow	yeah you have to forward ports
