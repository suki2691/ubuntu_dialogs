2007-05-28T15:11:00.000Z	Pelias		I got a question:
2007-05-28T15:12:00.000Z	Pelias		would it be safe to install ubuntu on raid 0 system (nforce4) which is already using windows xp?
2007-05-28T15:12:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	Pelias	hardware or software?
2007-05-28T15:12:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	Pelias	should be fine, the system will see it as one drive
