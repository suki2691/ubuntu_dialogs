2012-04-06T13:02:00.000Z	Raliegh		Oh, also, slightly unreleated... But do you know of a way to code a simple script (that can't be read/is obfuscated) that can SSH so my clients can run the restart command?
2012-04-06T13:02:00.000Z	Raliegh		I can't really use SSH keys since the IP will be different all the time, and that requires access on their PC to set up.
