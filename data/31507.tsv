2010-05-20T22:19:00.000Z	[Dead][Pixel]		I have an ubuntu desktop with onboard graphics, and a video card with dual output. I know how to set up dual monitors on the card, but was wondering, if I could possibly add a third monitor to the onboard video, to expand my desktop further, is this possible or do I need another video card?
