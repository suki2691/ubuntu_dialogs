2010-12-16T02:52:00.000Z	aaaaaa		Does anyone know how to make a bootable usb from a windows 7 ISO?
2010-12-16T02:53:00.000Z	aaaaaa		I dont have a computer with windows on to do it with, only linux
2010-12-16T02:54:00.000Z	aaaaaa		oh, i thought it only worked with Linux ISO files
2010-12-16T02:55:00.000Z	frxstrem	aaaaaa	according to http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/, it only does work on certain Linux distros (no Windows)...
