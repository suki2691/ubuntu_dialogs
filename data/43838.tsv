2009-11-02T21:39:00.000Z	aef		hi, i upgraded to 9.10 on amd64 (x86_64) and in the new version, notification popups are sometimes not directly under the top bar but have about one message box height distance to the bar. i don't like that, is that default? how can i change it?
2009-11-02T21:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	aef	i have the same issue (didn't upgrade though, did a fresh install)
2009-11-02T21:41:00.000Z	aef	ZykoticK9	any idea what one could do against it? i know the part of gnome is called gnome-notify
2009-11-02T21:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	aef	i have no ideas at all -- so far it hasn't bothered me "too" much.  best of luck man.
