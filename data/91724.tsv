2008-06-21T21:25:00.000Z	kliklik		I've just quit totem but it's still in the process list eating CPU and memory and I cannot kill it. ps aux|grep totem gives: kliklik 17893  8.5  9.5 168696 71068 ?        Dl   14:17  21:03 totem file:///home/kliklik... How can I kill it if it doesn't respond to kill -9 ?
