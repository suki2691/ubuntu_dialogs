2006-10-28T16:33:00.000Z	asdfr		I've just installed edgy and it's broken EVERYWHERE :(
2006-10-28T16:34:00.000Z	orion2012	asdfr	OK, how so?
2006-10-28T16:40:00.000Z	asdfr	orion2012	sorry upgraded to even.  It has messed up configuration files (evolution, gnome panel); qiv keeps crashing and I've had half a dozen crash screens with other apps too - .  Bootsplash doesn't display properly (it's off the rhs of the screen coming back on the left) and lots of key maps have been changed
2006-10-28T16:42:00.000Z	asdfr	orion2012	flash doesn't display either on many websites; it brings up a message saying that "This SWF file is known to trigger bugs in swfdec decoder"
