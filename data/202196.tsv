2008-07-23T23:41:00.000Z	Wright		I tried to boot from the ubuntu live cd from xp and nothing happened when i rebooted it just loaded XP like normal
2008-07-23T23:42:00.000Z	IdleOne	Wright	did you change the bios to boot from cd first?
2008-07-23T23:42:00.000Z	IdleOne	Wright	not all systems are set to boot from cd by default. you probably just need to change that and then reboot with the cd in tray
