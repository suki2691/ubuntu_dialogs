2010-08-27T07:18:00.000Z	jclark5093		I have a question about ubuntu vs debian - anyone with knowledge here?
2010-08-27T07:19:00.000Z	jclark5093		coz: is there any difference between an Ubuntu minimal install and a Debian base system? If so, what?
2010-08-27T07:20:00.000Z	jclark5093		Ok, I'm looking for help with Ubuntu Minimal install.  The problem is that Debian doesn't seem to work on my box.  I see that as Ubuntu support - I wanted to make sure that it was not going to be the same as Debian - sorry for sounding off topic :-/
2010-08-27T07:21:00.000Z	bazhang	jclark5093	just install the minimal iso and build from there. quite intuitive actually
