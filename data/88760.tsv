2010-08-12T01:20:00.000Z	arrrghhh	lelle	are you running dhcp?  are you able to see the AP from a scan?
2010-08-12T01:21:00.000Z	lelle	arrrghhh	 ? dont know, but my wired connection has an ip
2010-08-12T01:21:00.000Z	arrrghhh	lelle	ok... if you cant see any AP's with the wifi then i'd say you may not have the correct drivers... or the card is turned off in bios, etc.
