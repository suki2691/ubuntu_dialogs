2011-05-08T07:39:00.000Z	Desensitizerrr		Guys windows is terrible and sp1 broke my dual boot windows install so I am trying to back up every possible part of the bootloader related process
2011-05-08T07:40:00.000Z	Desensitizerrr		because I dont want to ruin how the computer boots which has happened in the past and I would like to attempt to copy the bootloader files over again after I reinstall to backup my boot situation
2011-05-08T07:41:00.000Z	Desensitizerrr		so does anyone know what I need to backup from the ubuntu/windows/etc file system in order to backup the bootloader for windows and linux completely?
