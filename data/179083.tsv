2011-01-18T18:57:00.000Z	lebear		I'm looking for some support on a dvd device issue
2011-01-18T18:59:00.000Z	lebear		the dvd in my laptop simply refused accepting any discs a few days back. tried blank dvd's, orginal dvd's, dvd-r's etc. nothing happened. I thought it was a hardware issue, bought one of those cleaning discs which actually did load (with some "cleaning in progress" music and video)
2011-01-18T18:59:00.000Z	lebear		now, how do I proceed to diagnose what the issue might be?
2011-01-18T19:00:00.000Z	jrib	lebear	probably a hardware issue, I've had many dvd drives fail.  You could try a different OS to see if it makes a difference
