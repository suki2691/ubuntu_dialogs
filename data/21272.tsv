2011-02-19T08:47:00.000Z	afuentes		Why the first part in ~/.ssh/known_hosts is not human redable? is not suppose to be the machines ip? ive got 3 machines with ubuntu and all of them are full of nonsense characters
2011-02-19T08:47:00.000Z	jack_	afuentes	i believe they are encrypted
2011-02-19T08:48:00.000Z	jack_	afuentes	you're not. it contains the encrypted keys of your machines
2011-02-19T08:53:00.000Z	afuentes	jack_	so is there no way to tell what machines those keys belong to?
