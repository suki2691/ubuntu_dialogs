2010-09-29T22:24:00.000Z	Guest16620		I'm trying to create a repo for my DEB files but the server I have is RHEL.  Can anyone point me to a tutorial of how to create a deb repo on an RHEL sever?

2010-09-29T22:26:00.000Z	Guest16620	xangua	I need it to work with debian as well and keep track of download statistics
2010-09-29T22:27:00.000Z	Guest16620	xangua	I already have DEB packages build on the openSuse-build service which I use for my RPMs for other distros as well
