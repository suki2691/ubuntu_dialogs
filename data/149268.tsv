2007-09-07T06:55:00.000Z	mattb		anyone know when linux-xen for x86_64 in gutsy will be ready?
2007-09-07T06:55:00.000Z	mattb		bug #132726, says the new package uploaded 9 hours ago should provide it, but launchpad says that's built and there is still no -xen image for x86_64...
2007-09-07T06:57:00.000Z	Pici	mattb	#ubuntu+1 for gutsy questions please.
2007-09-07T06:57:00.000Z	mattb	Pici	sorry, I'll head over there now ;0
