2008-09-09T10:42:00.000Z	NewUser		hi all, i have a strange problem with my sound, it will work sometimes and not others. the sound is global, ie mp3s, mpgs, even chat alerts on pidgins. they will just stop all of a sudden
2008-09-09T10:43:00.000Z	NewUser		ah ok johnny_ , any suggestions?
2008-09-09T10:43:00.000Z	NewUser		is there a way to maybe reset the sound?
2008-09-09T10:44:00.000Z	johnny_	NewUser	sorry.. i haven't kept up with it.. it happens infrequently enough for me to just reboot to fix it
