2006-02-27T08:09:00.000Z	MurraySW		Ok since no one seems to want to answer my novice questions privately, looks like it's time to embarras myself publicly....The .tar.bz2 extension is extractable/installable through what command?  What are some good resources for learning and putting to use linux bash commands ie: Is there a dictionary website or a good tutorial page?  Thanks....

2006-02-27T08:10:00.000Z	_jason	MurraySW	what are you trying to install?
