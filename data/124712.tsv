But my problem is with the firmware loading, when i try modprobe acx in dmesg aoutput says: [  216.632000]  requesting firmware image 'tiacx111cFF' [  216.744000]  acx: firmware image 'tiacx111cFF' was not provided. Check your hotplug scripts [  216.744000]  requesting firmware image 'tiacx111' [  216.748000]  acx
