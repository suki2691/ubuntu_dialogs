2006-12-04T14:08:00.000Z	foutrelis		Hello. I use Ubuntu 6.10 Edgy Eft and sometimes application crash. Firefox crashes quite a lot. Does it happen to you as well?
2006-12-04T14:08:00.000Z	solid_liq	foutrelis	my experience with 6.10 hasn't been good.  If you're new to ubuntu, I recommend you reinstall with 6.06 LTS
2006-12-04T14:08:00.000Z	solid_liq	foutrelis	a lot of stuff in 6.10 is broken
2006-12-04T14:09:00.000Z	foutrelis	solid_liq	so I have read. That the stable one is 6.06. I really like 6.10 though.
