2005-04-10T14:46:00.000Z	bbb_		I am having some problems install ubuntu / debian. I have a Athon64 board, a abit KV8 pro, with *crappy* software raid-0 setup(via chipset with via-raid).  I assuming that I have to use something like dmraid, but haven't been able to find any info on installation using this setup, any ideas ?
2005-04-10T14:47:00.000Z	confrey	bbb_	why do you use raid0?
2005-04-10T14:49:00.000Z	bbb_	confrey	I brought 2 hard drives, set them as  raid0  - seemed the right thing to do at the time :-( I've since installed windows x64 beta and have quite a bit of data on the raid that I don't really want to have to move :(
2005-04-10T15:04:00.000Z	bbb_	confrey	its starting to look like I going to have to move all my data off and un-raid the drives :-(, most anoying thing about that is that my PC has no floppy, so when I reinstall windows for playing the odd game that I can't play from linux, I have to move the PC + attach a floppy :)
