2006-04-26T15:47:00.000Z	Illnor		quick stupid question: I have a dual boot of Ubuntu Breezy (amd64) and XP.. I want to write over the breezy partitions with a kubuntu 6.06 i386 beta.. this is doable right?
2006-04-26T15:49:00.000Z	Illnor		I've got a Winchester 3200.. 2.0ghz originally but I've got it at 2.65Ghz now.. so I'm not concerned with whatever puny speed boost there is.. not with such a dramatically reduced functionality
2006-04-26T15:50:00.000Z	Illnor		is there some guide for writing over ubuntu as I'm planning on?
2006-04-26T15:50:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Illnor	just point the installer at the existing partitions
