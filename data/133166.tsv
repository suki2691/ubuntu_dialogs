2009-06-26T07:59:00.000Z	Firefishe		Folks, is this sequence correct:  Hardy, Intrepid, Jaunty ?
2009-06-26T07:59:00.000Z	unitheory	Firefishe	yep
2009-06-26T08:08:00.000Z	unitheory	Firefishe	probably primary. logical partitions are for when you need more than 5 or so (i forget the exact number)
2009-06-26T08:10:00.000Z	Firefishe	unitheory	I thought so, or something to that effect.  Primaries also have less problems, imho.  For such a small system, anyway.
