2008-09-25T18:28:00.000Z	jrib	D_Graham	no, not until it is released
2008-09-25T18:29:00.000Z	D_Graham	jrib	I know the final release is set for Oct 30, i got it running on my virtual machine
2008-09-25T18:30:00.000Z	jrib	D_Graham	right.  You shouldn't be depending on it until it is actually released.  It's for anyone who wants to test stuff until then
