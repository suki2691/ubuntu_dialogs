2007-08-11T13:52:00.000Z	lightfight		I'm trying to move a file in the firefox folder but only the root has permission to move it. I know I need to use sudo in the command line but I don't know what else I have to type in order to get permission to move the file? Can someone help.

2007-08-11T13:53:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	lightfight	yes
