2009-10-12T17:35:00.000Z	r_s___		I have ubuntu 9.04 and wanna create a swap area,, which is better.. to create a swap partition (it's difficult for me coz I don't have enough space for format) or to create a swap file ?
2009-10-12T17:35:00.000Z	deww	r_s___	either is fine.
2009-10-12T17:36:00.000Z	r_s___	deww	so I can create the swap file without any drawbacks ?
