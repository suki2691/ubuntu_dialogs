2010-03-08T21:35:00.000Z	hekin	ASULutzy	i just installed that
2010-03-08T21:35:00.000Z	hekin	ASULutzy	can it help to control the fan speed?
2010-03-08T21:36:00.000Z	ASULutzy	hekin	Well, it will give you the temps of your CPU, and then you can go from there. Generally you can adjust fan settings in the BIOS. I actually don't know a "speedfan" sort of app for Ubuntu, but I'm sure there is one.
