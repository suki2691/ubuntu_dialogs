2005-10-03T16:54:00.000Z	jjazz	trigg	 I was just wondering if apt-get was somehow smart enough to know not to kill kdm if you were using synaptic. :P
2005-10-03T16:55:00.000Z	trigg	jjazz	I don't think so.  if you use apt-get then you should probably kill kdm first
2005-10-03T16:55:00.000Z	jjazz	trigg	 Agreed.
