2005-10-19T13:30:00.000Z	tristanmike	viller	are you running breezy and have the backports uncommented?
2005-10-19T13:31:00.000Z	tristanmike	viller	as I understand it, there are no backports or extras for breezy as of yet, so they must either be removed, or commented temporarilly
2005-10-19T13:44:00.000Z	tristanmike	viller	is there no "Search for Files" under Places?
