2007-02-20T09:02:00.000Z	distant_voic1		hooray! after lots of problems I managed to install Ubuntu 6.1. I just startedt to mount my windows partition but I need root access. I know it's a stupid question, but what is the root pass? I know my own user pass, but it's not identical with the root pass and I have no idea where to get a root pass. Any help is appreciated!
