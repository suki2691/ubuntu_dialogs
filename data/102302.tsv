2008-10-28T09:24:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		except when it doesn't work, and nobody seems to have an inkling of how to make it work....
2008-10-28T09:24:00.000Z	rww	Geoffrey2	most of the times when wireless cards don't work, they're from a crappy closed-source vendor who actively refuses to cooperate with efforts to write Linux wireless drivers.
2008-10-28T09:26:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	rww	in my case...the wireless was working fine, had been working fine since Hardy came out, then all of a sudden one day stopped seeing anything...since then, all attempts on here to find out if my card's simply dead or if it's something I can fix have pretty much been met with total silence
