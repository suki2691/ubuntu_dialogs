2006-01-16T14:56:00.000Z	drunkpikachu		My ubuntu installed normally and I've come to a hang during startup. I've found the solution on the forum, but I don't know how to actually access and edit the file xorg.conf. Can anyone help me out?
2006-01-16T14:56:00.000Z	drunkpikachu		yes
2006-01-16T14:57:00.000Z	drunkpikachu		what can I put in for _editor_? vi? Or do I have the wrong idea?
2006-01-16T14:58:00.000Z	calamari	drunkpikachu	yeah.. vi, nano, gedit (etc)
