2010-08-02T12:17:00.000Z	Bridge|		Anyone know if Ubuntu will every Work with Logitech BT keyboards/Mice, MX550 & MX5000 & Dinovo & Dinovo Mini and I'm sure others...... This problem has been extremely frustrating, and while there are some workarounds, nothing works 100% while the kb/mouse are still BT, their have been workarounds in past releases they get the KB/Mouse working almost 100% but in failback usb emulation mode(which is not what anybody wants who own these devices), Anytime you
