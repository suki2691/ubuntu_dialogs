2011-10-03T21:46:00.000Z	glitchd		there seems to be a longer than normal boot post and it takes around 2-5 mins to fully boot
2011-10-03T21:47:00.000Z	glitchd	andyvy	i should also add, that yesterday i somehow or another removed my graphics driver, so i had to go thru about a 3-4 hr process to figure out how to get it back, and that would include installing vesa drivers to use while i got the right vid driver
