2005-01-08T11:37:00.000Z	steven_noob		Quick question... Anyone know what the application that tracks battery power for laptops in gnome is called? It keeps telling me I only have 1 minute of battery life left, but I'm currently hooked to the power outlet
2005-01-08T11:38:00.000Z	steven_noob		Any idea where I can find more information on it?
2005-01-08T11:39:00.000Z	steven_noob		Ok I actually was wondering if there were ubuntu specific docs for it
2005-01-08T11:39:00.000Z	zenrox	steven_noob	 nope
