I've tried 'umount' and 'eject' but the green light on the USB is still on... somehow ubuntu has the option to 'safely remove' on it's gui and it turns the light off, is there any way to do it on Gentoo's command line?

2010-08-07T21:58:00.000Z	maco	icmp_request	if its unmounted it can be removed
2010-08-07T21:58:00.000Z	maco	icmp_request	the point of safely eject is to sync & unount
