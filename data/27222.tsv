2011-05-17T22:15:00.000Z	Stava		I also managed to uninstall transmissions indicator applet, how can I reinstall all the default indicator applets for natty?
2011-05-17T22:17:00.000Z	Darael	Stava	Try installing indicator-applet-complete.  Or possibly indicator-datetime.  Get a list of the indicator packages by doing "apt-cache show indicator-"<tab><tab>.

2011-05-17T22:19:00.000Z	Darael	Stava	That ought to do it too - although it'll pull evolution back in IIRC.
