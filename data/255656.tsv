2004-12-11T07:10:00.000Z	Mesta		hey guys, I hate to ask this but I stuck ubuntu on my brother's CD and now he wants to put windoze back on (believe it), anyway he gets a ubuntu backsplash.  How does he boot from the windoze CD?
2004-12-11T07:10:00.000Z	keknehv	Mesta	take out the ubuntu cd, then restart
2004-12-11T07:11:00.000Z	Mesta		there is on ubuntu CD.  It is already installed. It's windoze he wants to boot from.
2004-12-11T07:13:00.000Z	Mesta	keknehv	orga:  Take the CD out and inicite the stupid windoze install while booted from ubuntu?
