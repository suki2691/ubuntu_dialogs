2012-05-06T23:57:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	IntuitiveNipple	so you have the same problem too with no good solution (I mean besides slamming the mouse of course, lol)
2012-05-06T23:57:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Jeremy3D	It seems to have got better with recent updates from the -proposed repository
2012-05-06T23:58:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	IntuitiveNipple	i've updated every day but stills seems to lag. I'll give Fyodorovna idea a try
