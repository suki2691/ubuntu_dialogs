2006-04-30T07:39:00.000Z	alexcamilo		i've noticed something odd about the splash screen in edubuntu. it's nice and shiny provided that nothing goes wrong but when something fails it goes back to white text mode. marks it as "failed" and continues.  is there any way to tell it to stay in that spash screen?  its annoying when something like contacting the ntp server when not online fails.
