2007-10-12T09:14:00.000Z	urthmover		will there be a difference with the /iso for the new 710...than the beta that I can download now?   can I just download the beta now...and do some updates in 6 days when the official release comes out?
2007-10-12T09:15:00.000Z	urthmover		ok great thanks
2007-10-12T09:16:00.000Z	urthmover		I just don't want to have to re-install in half a week.  so I was confirming that I can just run update-manager to fix it up to final
2007-10-12T09:17:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	urthmover	correct. update-manager will do that without reinstalling
