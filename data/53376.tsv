2009-07-23T12:24:00.000Z	paolo		Hi guys! I have a MS keyboard, which by default sends alternate codes for the functions key, and in order to get the usual codes I must press a F buttun every time I boot. Is there any trick in order to get the function key working as expected automatically? thank you!
