2007-11-27T02:07:00.000Z	robin		hi! i'm just trying to install ubuntu for a friend on a dell desktop. am having problems though - managed to boot from the disc, the pre-login orange/brown screen has come up, but nothing has developed since! have been waiting for ages...
2007-11-27T02:09:00.000Z	robin		does anyone know why it could not be working? the cd is from the linux format magazine, so it should be good...
