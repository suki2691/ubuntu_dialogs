2009-09-06T22:09:00.000Z	mmaruseacph2		i receive this: gpg: keyserver timed out
2009-09-06T22:09:00.000Z	musikgoat	mmaruseacph2	could be down, or it could be your connection... got a link i can test for you?
2009-09-06T22:14:00.000Z	musikgoat	mmaruseacph2	the keyserver isn't down, i can successfully import a key from it
