2007-04-05T10:53:00.000Z	GrahamT		I just installed ubuntu, but cannot get telnet to work.  I ran apt-get install telnetd and received a message that it could not find the telnetd package
2007-04-05T10:53:00.000Z	Flannel	GrahamT	you need to just use telnet?  or you want to run a telnet server?
2007-04-05T10:54:00.000Z	Flannel	GrahamT	telnet server, eh?  May I ask why not ssh?
2007-04-05T10:54:00.000Z	Flannel	GrahamT	telnetd is in universe, you'll need to enable universe
