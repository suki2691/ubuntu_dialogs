2007-01-31T14:00:00.000Z	Lattyware		Hey, I have a small problem, I have a panel with draws on on one monitor, move it to my other one, and when I open the panels, they open on the far rightmost corner of the origonal screen, instead of where they are meant to be.
2007-01-31T14:00:00.000Z	Lattyware		Any way of fixing this?
2007-01-31T14:00:00.000Z	po0f	Lattyware	Move the panels, then kill/restart them maybe?
2007-01-31T14:01:00.000Z	Lattyware	po0f	I've rebooted to no effect (been a problem for a while, never bothered to ask)
