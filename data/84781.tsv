2008-07-28T03:27:00.000Z	derrich	debian_akroyd	ffmpeg wasn't installed by default, so i installed it manually. but to do what i'm trying to do, i need ffmpeg to have liba52 support, which isn't the 'default' option within aptitude
2008-07-28T03:28:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	derrich	i would use synaptic to look for liba52
2008-07-28T03:29:00.000Z	derrich	debian_akroyd	that package is already installed
