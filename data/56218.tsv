2009-05-27T19:15:00.000Z	TOM_SAMARI		Hey guys, i've installed ubuntu via wubi to run dual boot alongside a windows install...  and i'm trying to access my files from my ubuntu install via windows. I've downloaded both Explore2fs and driver-fs but I don't seem to have an EXT2 file anywhere? Any help would be appreciated!

2009-05-27T19:17:00.000Z	TOM_SAMARI	Jack_Sparrow	I've read it and it makes NO sense! It's 2 lines that say 'use driver-fs or explore2fs'
2009-05-27T19:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	TOM_SAMARI	I wont use wubi or recommend it to anyone.
