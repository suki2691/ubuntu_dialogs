2008-08-21T11:14:00.000Z	Whiz2	deltaslaya	if it mounts as a removeable drive then just copy/paste
2008-08-21T11:16:00.000Z	deltaslaya	Whiz2	But how can I do it in a way so I can access them on the iPod?
2008-08-21T11:17:00.000Z	Whiz2	deltaslaya	honestly the only way I know to mess with an iPod is through iTunes on a windows machine
