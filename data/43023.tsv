2009-11-24T05:23:00.000Z	ZaNeIuM		my win7 install is no longer able to boot, from my grub2 menu, but i can still boot ubuntu. if i chooise to 'fix' my issue with the win7 setup disk, you you think i will loose my ability to boot to ubuntu??
2009-11-24T05:24:00.000Z	mMezquitale	ZaNeIuM	can you run grub-probe and grub-update to fix that?
2009-11-24T05:25:00.000Z	ZaNeIuM	mMezquitale	even with grub2? do i do that from the live cd?
2009-11-24T05:26:00.000Z	mMezquitale	ZaNeIuM	no, once youre inside ubuntu if you see win7 as an option but it doesnt boot you can try logging in to ubuntu then probe and update grub, if not you can use chainloader to boot win7 or add another line in grub config to boot up win7 correctly
