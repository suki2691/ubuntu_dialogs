Same hardware, same setup, same files, same everything except ... one is using comm from ubuntu, one is using comm from debian.  The debian one finishes in 1-2 minutes.   The comm version on ubuntu takes upwards of 20+ minutes.
2011-01-13T05:34:00.000Z	Karen_m		My question would be, is there a way to get a newer or older version of comm on ubuntu?
2011-01-13T05:35:00.000Z	deutsch	Karen_m	, its public secret that ubuntu is much, much slower than debian. and with bugs any more
2011-01-13T05:36:00.000Z	Karen_m	deutsch	are you being funny?  I'm asking how to get a newer version of 'comm' on my ubuntu box
