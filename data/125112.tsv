2008-01-23T19:19:00.000Z	xplozion		im about to switch to ubuntu 7.10 x64 with my computer at work. Here at work in order to get internet access besides your domain user needs to have access you must install a M$ firewall client conected to the ISA server. Whats the Linux app for this one?
2008-01-23T19:21:00.000Z	scguy318	xplozion	googling "ISA Server Linux" gives me this as the first hit: http://www.linux.com/base/ldp/howto/Web-Browsing-Behind-ISA-Server-HOWTO.html
2008-01-23T19:22:00.000Z	xplozion	scguy318	Thanks, i was reading that exactly same HOWTO ;) just wanted to know another way, plus in order to get IRC / aMSN, etc you need it
