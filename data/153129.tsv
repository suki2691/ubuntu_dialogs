2007-06-10T14:16:00.000Z	miles_		Planning to get a new laptop for Ubuntu. Are nvidia GeForce GO 8400 supported by Linux drivers, proprietary or not?
2007-06-10T14:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	miles_	i'm pretty sure it is.. generally Nvidia will be supported much better than ATI
2007-06-10T14:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	miles_	check the link.. if its supported it will be on that list.
