2012-06-15T06:41:00.000Z	alan502	MadBoat	I connect to the internet through a wireless connection on this computer. The wireless connection uses an http proxy to connect to the web. This computer is also connected to a router via wired network. I want the wireless internet connection on this computer to be shared via my router. Can you help me? I'll really appreciate it
