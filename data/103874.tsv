2012-04-01T18:37:00.000Z	Matrix		Anyone know of a way to slipstream  propriatary drivers into the install iso ?
2012-04-01T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Matrix	you can remaster the ISO and add whatever you want
2012-04-01T18:39:00.000Z	Matrix	ActionParsnip	So I can add nvida drivers to the install process ?
2012-04-01T18:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Matrix	you can if you want, they are just packages like any other, bit pointless as they are available once you get booted....
