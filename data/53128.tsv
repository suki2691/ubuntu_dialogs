2009-07-09T02:28:00.000Z	Alphonse		Hey. I've just installed Ubuntu and it's my first time ever using linux. How do I install new programs. When I download a program online for linux it comes as a .bin file (so far as I can tell, every time). What do I use to compile the binaries that I download? How do I get my programs running?
