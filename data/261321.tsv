2009-06-04T23:34:00.000Z	Ewok94		ok brilliant - the hardware is the usual stuff
2009-06-04T23:34:00.000Z	dkg	Ewok94	I've used the live cd on many different machines and ALL the hardware just worked (including printers and what-have-you)
2009-06-04T23:37:00.000Z	dkg	Ewok94	nvidia GF5200fx worked fine, now my GF9800GT works great too (with the closed source drivers mind you)
