At install, I specified the mount point to be /media/media. It came up on the desktop labeled media after the install, but after a reinstall, it's labelled "TAGSick Of". Neither fstab nor mtab seem to be glitched, but it doesn't go away by unmounting, then remounting.

2006-08-16T06:57:00.000Z	Vitamin1		ok, thanks. I've never seen this happen before, so I had no idea what was causing it.
2006-08-16T06:58:00.000Z	Vitamin1	sproingie	where would that desktop file be located?
