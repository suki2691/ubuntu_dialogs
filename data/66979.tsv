2009-10-18T17:07:00.000Z	Splendid		how do I ssh to server, server is listening ssh requests on port 8888 instead 22
2009-10-18T17:07:00.000Z	Splendid		so ssh user@domain_ip doesn't work
2009-10-18T17:08:00.000Z	janisozaur	Splendid	i'd try user@domain:ip, as in url - this would shorten the notation a bit should there be such a shorthand
2009-10-18T17:09:00.000Z	janisozaur	Splendid	i meant user@domain:port
