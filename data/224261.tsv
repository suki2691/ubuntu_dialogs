2005-09-20T07:36:00.000Z	sybariten		i had an accidental shutdown of my computer (a mac!) and upong the next reboot, gnome wouldnt completely load. plain ubuntu. there was a message about "the bonobo-activation server", and after reading some cases (too sloppy!!) on the web, i decided to try and replace gnome-panel
2005-09-20T07:36:00.000Z	sybariten		soneone else had had similar problem due to a broken gnome-panel
2005-09-20T07:37:00.000Z	sybariten		so an apt-get install didnt do much, so i removed it ... apt-get remove gnome-panel. Well, turns out now, the machine appearently has no net connection so a simple apt-get install gnome-panel wasnt such a simple task as i believed
