2009-12-08T12:25:00.000Z	MeatPopsicle	Ademan	why are you asking me that?
2009-12-08T12:26:00.000Z	Ademan	MeatPopsicle	in "The Fifth Element" bruce willis states that he is not human, but instead a meat popsicle i thought maybe you were making a movie reference... hah
2009-12-08T12:28:00.000Z	Ademan	MeatPopsicle	he was being sarcastic, he was asked "are you classified as human" when, of course, he clearly was, so he responded like that
