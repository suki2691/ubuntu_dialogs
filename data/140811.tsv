2007-04-01T05:13:00.000Z	Slart		What alternatives to skype would you people recommend? I need conference calls and windows/linux/mac clients. Anything special to watch out for?
2007-04-01T05:15:00.000Z	tc3driver	Slart	it is a goofy solution, but team speak works well
2007-04-01T05:16:00.000Z	tc3driver		not too sure about mac compatibility though
2007-04-01T05:16:00.000Z	Slart	tc3driver	mm.. I (we) use teamspeak at the moment.. but we have major sound problems using it.. I'm looking for something else
