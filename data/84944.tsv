2009-08-04T01:37:00.000Z	efu		How is network manager supposed to show me available mobile broadband connections, or error messages? I make a connection, and nothing happens. I have no idea if theres something wrong with my connection settings, or if the modem driver isn't working. No response at all. Any hints on where I can look?
