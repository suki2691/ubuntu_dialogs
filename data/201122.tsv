2006-10-12T09:33:00.000Z	O2		As I saw many apps such as  Kxxxx ,  GNOxxxx,  then I guesss they can only run on KDE, or GNOME
2006-10-12T09:33:00.000Z	Boelcke	O2	another way of saying it would be, if you've got the KDE and Gnome stuff installed, you can run applications specific to one of them in either.
2006-10-12T09:34:00.000Z	Boelcke	O2	for example, I use the GIMP in gnome, where it's native, yet I like Kdigicam for managing my photos.  It works just fine under gnome (though I've got all the kde stuff installed too)
2006-10-12T09:34:00.000Z	Boelcke	O2	so, if you didn't have the KDE stuff installed, you would NOT be able to run a K-application in gnome.
