2006-11-12T08:12:00.000Z	marios_s		Hello, I've installed ubuntu and then windows. Now the problem is that I can't dual-boot with windows boot loader. I tried using live ubuntu and then running grub-install but there's no way also after chrooting on the brand-new linux partition. How can I dual boot?
