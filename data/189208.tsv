2006-04-28T05:33:00.000Z	unl3ss		Can anyone help me with this? I just hooked up my external USB hard drive that's formatted with NTFS, but I don't have the permissions to write because apparently it's a "read-only disk." I never set it this way and I just think it's because it's NTFS... how can I enable writing?
2006-04-28T05:35:00.000Z	unl3ss		alright mfb__ and david_uk: thanks... but is there any workaround possible?
2006-04-28T05:36:00.000Z	david_uk	unl3ss	nope... NTFS cannot be written to from linux yet... so switch the file system to something friendly to both... FAT
2006-04-28T05:36:00.000Z	unl3ss	david_uk	Alright, thanks a lot!
