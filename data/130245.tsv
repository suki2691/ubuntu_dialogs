2007-07-05T08:28:00.000Z	mongolai	josh__	do you see ssh or port 22 listed as listening if you netstat -tap
2007-07-05T08:30:00.000Z	mongolai	josh__	are you trying to connect on a LAN, or from the WAN side?
2007-07-05T08:32:00.000Z	mongolai	josh__	you need to make sure to use the proper IP address which can be found by ifconfig
