2007-02-02T11:03:00.000Z	agliv5		I had to update glib to >= 2.5 and, in doing so, removed the standard glib ubuntu package.  Ubuntu didn't like that and now I'm trying to fix it.  Anyone feel up to helping me?
2007-02-02T11:04:00.000Z	agliv5		I have a question.  If I install a new version of ubuntu, will my files in /home/ be effected?
2007-02-02T11:05:00.000Z	bigcx2	agliv5	do you mean an upgrade?
