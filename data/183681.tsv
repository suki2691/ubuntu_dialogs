2006-09-19T13:53:00.000Z	pedrocr		meaning: not completely broken and ready for user testing
2006-09-19T13:54:00.000Z	adolson	pedrocr	I am using Edgy, and my evolution is broken and so is my openoffice.org.. I'm sure an update will fix them soon enough though. not much different than running sid, really.. the point is to test it and report bugs
2006-09-19T13:55:00.000Z	pedrocr	adolson	don't use any of those, thanks
