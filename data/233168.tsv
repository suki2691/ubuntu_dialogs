2009-12-26T18:28:00.000Z	ambro718		Hi, how do I get bash man pages (e.g. trap, wait)?
2009-12-26T18:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	ambro718	help wait
2009-12-26T18:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	ambro718	help trap; help read; etc...
2009-12-26T18:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	ambro718	maybe gentoo has an independent (not bash built in) program
