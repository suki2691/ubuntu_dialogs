2008-11-23T09:40:00.000Z	ubuntu_		greetings all! I am encountering this error message whenever I try to install any version of ubuntu(kubuntu and xubuntu): the installer encountered an error copying files to the hard disk [Erno 5] Input/output error
2008-11-23T09:40:00.000Z	ubuntu_		there is more but I don't know if I should show that as well
2008-11-23T09:40:00.000Z	ubuntu_		I was in the process of installing and it reached 52% before I received that error message again
2008-11-23T09:40:00.000Z	jkoltner	ubuntu_	: That's typical due to a read/write error on the install media or your hard drive...
