2006-09-28T14:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Hyperion|Sleep	 not that ive heard of.. at least not easialy.
2006-09-28T14:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Hyperion|Sleep	 ya could perhaps use vmware, or qemu.. but thats a scary way
2006-09-28T15:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Hyperion|Sleep	 its easy to setup/install in a vmware session.. but thats not a normal install that will be bootable by iteslf.
