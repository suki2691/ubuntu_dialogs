2011-04-05T03:47:00.000Z	mouse		I have a concern with the linux/unix file system.  With how file naming works and new software coming out everyday isn't it just a matter of time before one program installs it's files over another's and messes things up?  For example two programs writing different executables to the same location with the same file name?  That's obviously a rookie mistake but isn't that cause for concern?

2011-04-05T03:48:00.000Z	mickster04	mouse	how likely is that?
2011-04-05T03:48:00.000Z	mickster04	mouse	that is just as likely in windows?
