2008-05-01T14:08:00.000Z	PaRaSiTe2		Does 64bit Hardy support Intel 536EP modem?  If I want to swap from 64bit to 32bit but keep settings, how would I do that?  And can I format just a partition with Windows on, then reinstall Windows on that partition without losing Hardy (forgetting bootloader problem)?

2008-05-01T14:13:00.000Z	PaRaSiTe2	arvind_khadri	I know 32bit can't run 64bit.
