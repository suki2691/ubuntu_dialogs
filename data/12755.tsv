2011-07-02T07:39:00.000Z	escott	rakathan	don't think you can. the opencl libraries depend on the nvidia glx driver iirc

2011-07-02T07:44:00.000Z	rakathan	escott	that looks promising...from what I can tell, it looks like ATI has two things going on: their "stream" sdk and a future OpenCL sdk not available yet
