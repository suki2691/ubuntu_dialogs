2010-05-29T11:34:00.000Z	Docteh	justin22885	most likely would be fat32, really sure is ext4 ;)
2010-05-29T11:40:00.000Z	Docteh	justin22885	ubuntu has a special handler that lets you mount file systems that dont have permissions as a user, so fat32 or ntfs is the way to go if thats 100% required
2010-05-29T11:44:00.000Z	Docteh	justin22885	go with HFS then
