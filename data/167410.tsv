2007-09-01T06:05:00.000Z	Meroigo		if I have installed Ubuntu Server, and want a GUI, isn't there a one that doesn't have one million unnecessary programs in it (like openoffice, games. etc etc)? It's a little big heavy with "apt-get install ubuntu-desktop" on a computer that's only a srver...
2007-09-01T06:06:00.000Z	IdleOne	Meroigo	you can try sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
2007-09-01T06:06:00.000Z	Meroigo	IdleOne	xubuntu is a lightweight gui? :)
2007-09-01T06:06:00.000Z	IdleOne	Meroigo	yes
