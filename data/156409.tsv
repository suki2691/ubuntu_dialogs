2009-02-18T08:37:00.000Z	O__o		hi how come i have invalid hostname message when bootup ubuntu ?
2009-02-18T08:38:00.000Z	genii	O__o	Probably you tried to set a name with some illegal character in it like a space, or !@#$%^&*()   or so on
2009-02-18T08:38:00.000Z	genii	O__o	That would be my first guess
2009-02-18T08:39:00.000Z	genii	O__o	Use a dash instead of an underbar
