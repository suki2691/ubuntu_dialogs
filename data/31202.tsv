2010-05-27T00:46:00.000Z	BluesKaj-L	Scunizi	network-manager used to be uninstalled automatically but I think it's just disables when wicd is installed
2010-05-27T00:47:00.000Z	BluesKaj-L		err disabled
2010-05-27T00:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	BluesKaj-L	Monotoko .. ok.. network-manager drives me nuts.. it won't allow me to assign a static ip that sticks through reboots and manually doing it through resolv.conf and /etc/network/interfaces get over-ridden by NM...
