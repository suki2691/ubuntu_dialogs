2010-06-22T05:45:00.000Z	luke-jr		why isn't mplayer in universe? :/
2010-06-22T05:45:00.000Z	rww	luke-jr	because it contains legally-problematic codecs, and is thus in multiverse
2010-06-22T05:46:00.000Z	rww	luke-jr	plus, based on the package description, I believe there are licensing issues
2010-06-22T05:50:00.000Z	luke-jr	rww	so Ubuntu doesn't have a free mplayer?
