2008-12-07T09:02:00.000Z	dukenukem		hello, i am trying to change from windows to ubuntu but i have run into some problems, i wonder if someone can help me out. the problem stems from the fact my cdrom drive is screwed and i cannot boot from cd. i also cannot boot from usb as my bios is too old. (old computer). i wonder if i can install ubuntu from windows, is this possible? please message me privately if you have an idea, thanks in advance.
