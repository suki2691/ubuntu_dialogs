2010-03-19T18:03:00.000Z	arand_	eremite	Should be in the menus, "terminal" if I guess correctly...
2010-03-19T18:04:00.000Z	eremite	arand_	not the name of the terminal window, the name of teh ba.  I can change the name of the terminal with ease, its the tab I need to change.  All tabs open in Gnome-terminal are named after the terminla, not the app running or a customized name (like I want)
2010-03-19T18:05:00.000Z	arand_	eremite	Hmm, not sure how to do that, sorry.
