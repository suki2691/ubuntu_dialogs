2009-08-07T11:34:00.000Z	richardcavell	firecrotch	Yeah, I know.  I just port scanned 27017 using the Shields Up website, and it appears to be blocked.  So how come my computer received the packets at all?
2009-08-07T11:35:00.000Z	firecrotch	richardcavell	have you looked into what is at those IPs?
2009-08-07T11:37:00.000Z	richardcavell	firecrotch	No.  There are 5 IPs.  Most of them are 68.*.*.* and one is 208.*.*.*
