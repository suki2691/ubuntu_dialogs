2006-05-27T10:44:00.000Z	anjin_		Ok then.. are there any other cd/dvd burning packages other than K3b that I can try?  I need something that will recognize and burn various image types, as well as write VIDEO_TS dvd folders, etc... I can't get K3b to work and nobody here seems willing to help :(
2006-05-27T10:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	anjin_	 odd that you are having k3b issues - it works great for me.
2006-05-27T10:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	anjin_	 run it from a terminal and see if any error messages are being printed.
2006-05-27T10:46:00.000Z	anjin_	Dr_Willis	- Should I use sudo k3b?
