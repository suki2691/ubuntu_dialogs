2010-08-19T01:03:00.000Z	weedar		I'm trying to find out what features seahorse-plugins provide, there isn't really much information about it online..Does anyone know?
2010-08-19T01:04:00.000Z	rww	weedar	right-click -> Encrypt in Nautilus, encrypt/decrypt plugins for gedit, double-click actions for encrypted files, signed files, and keyrings, etc.
2010-08-19T01:05:00.000Z	weedar	rww	Thanks, that was a great answer :) double-click action for encrypted files expect a specific filename-suffix I suppose?
2010-08-19T01:06:00.000Z	rww	weedar	I'm not sure. If it uses suffixes, it'd be .asc and .gpg. It might just detect, though
