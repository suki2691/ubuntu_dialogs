2011-03-27T09:55:00.000Z	lazyPower		Is there a way to enable starting X applications on a remote Ubuntu desktop over ssh?
2011-03-27T09:55:00.000Z	syn-ack	lazyPower	look at x forwarding
2011-03-27T09:56:00.000Z	lazyPower		for example, i'd like to ssh into my desktop, and start a VLC session. however i'm getting a "unable to connect to x server"
2011-03-27T09:56:00.000Z	lazyPower	syn-ack	that only "forwards" the connection to my client so i could se it locally right? thats not what i want.
