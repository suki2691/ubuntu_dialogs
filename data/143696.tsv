But XMMS (for example) plays sound on my internal Laptop speakers. (Selected ALSA in XMMS settings with default audio autput device). If i select OOS, sound comes from my external card but then no other app can play sound to that device. I tried every possible configuration but i cant get all apps to play sound over
