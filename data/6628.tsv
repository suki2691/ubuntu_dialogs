2012-01-04T20:25:00.000Z	vonfatz		total ubuntu/linux newbie here. last night I installed ubuntu onto a flash drive, and spent today setting up e-mail, browser, etc. I realized just now that I've been doing this under the default ubuntu account, and would like to move everything to a passworded account. is there a way that I can either transfer all of my settings, or rename and password the default account?

2012-01-04T20:28:00.000Z	vonfatz	mneptok	done, I'm logged into the default right now, but have already set up the one I want.
