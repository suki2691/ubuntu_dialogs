2006-05-31T08:39:00.000Z	onkarshinde	tuxtheslacker	you can remove mozilla-mplayer if you want to use totem-xine plugin
2006-05-31T08:40:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	onkarshinde	 this thing appears to run a little bit better than the mozilla plugin, in that it will run this video without making it REALLY choppy.
