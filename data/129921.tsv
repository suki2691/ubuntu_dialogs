2007-08-28T14:09:00.000Z	bkeating	reD_Fox1	a service is probably waiting to either active (ie get network connection) or time out
2007-08-28T14:10:00.000Z	reD_Fox1	bkeating	so, I shut down ubuntu, then turn the computer back on. the boot process hangs right before loading gnome. I reboot the computer manually, and it then boots fine.
2007-08-28T14:11:00.000Z	reD_Fox1	bkeating	where does the service thing you mentioned come into play?
