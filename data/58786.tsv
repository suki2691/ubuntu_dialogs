2009-04-30T00:06:00.000Z	alikkon		I'm having an issue with Apt-get basically telling me that packages don't exist when the repository search claims they do. - for example, apt-get install mgetty returns "Couldn't find package mgetty"
2009-04-30T00:07:00.000Z	uberNoob	alikkon	check and see if its a real package
2009-04-30T00:08:00.000Z	alikkon	uberNoob	mgetty shows up on a package search at the ubuntu site.  It is indeed a real package.
2009-04-30T00:09:00.000Z	uberNoob	alikkon	tried neskats recommendation?
