2008-12-03T21:03:00.000Z	kb3ien		looking for useful pointers to setup 8.10 on a graphite g4 with an ATI rage128 card. I cannot seem to get past E no screens found.
2008-12-03T21:04:00.000Z	bobthemil	kb3ien	You know, I have a very very similar problem
2008-12-03T21:06:00.000Z	bobthemil	kb3ien	try skipping the "no screens found" issue and then later on manually configuring xorg.conf
2008-12-03T21:07:00.000Z	bobthemil	kb3ien	If you give me a couple of hours, you can copy mine line for line (probably)
