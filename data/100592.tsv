2010-07-02T10:10:00.000Z	deltree_		so why was i denied permission to extract before using the terminal to open the archive manager?
2010-07-02T10:12:00.000Z	prince_jammys	deltree_	because you ran fileroller as admin using 'gksu', which allowed you to write to /usr/share/whatever
2010-07-02T10:12:00.000Z	prince_jammys	deltree_	had you just typed 'fileroller' you still would have been denied permission.
