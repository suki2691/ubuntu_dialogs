2010-07-07T05:24:00.000Z	Scunizi		This drives me crazy..... I need to install Openoffice Base. When looking at the repos there are 2 versions 3.2.0-7Ubuntu4.1 and 3.2.0-7Ubuntu4 ... what's the difference and which one do I install that works with the default installed in 10.04??
2010-07-07T05:24:00.000Z	DocPlatypus	Scunizi	I'd go ahead and put the 4.1 files on
2010-07-07T05:24:00.000Z	DocPlatypus		all other things being equal you should install most recent
2010-07-07T05:25:00.000Z	Scunizi	DocPlatypus	I was thinking that the 4.1 was development version.. but I could be wrong
