2008-11-23T00:54:00.000Z	MrBougo		I have both linux-image-2.6.24-19-generic and linux-image-2.6.27-7-generic installed but I'm booting into linux-image-2.6.27-7-generic.... how come?
2008-11-23T00:54:00.000Z	_Zeus_	MrBougo	because -7 is the newer one?
2008-11-23T00:56:00.000Z	_Zeus_	MrBougo	did it ask you about changing the menu.lst when you updated?
2008-11-23T00:56:00.000Z	MrBougo	_Zeus_	maybe, I don't remember :/
