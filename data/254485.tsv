2005-06-17T15:01:00.000Z	xingmu		is there any way to capture memory of a frozen application in linux?  firefox just locked up on me after i had written a huge blog post but before i had a chance to post it.  i'd do anything to believe there is someway to recover that text!
2005-06-17T15:02:00.000Z	xingmu		btw, i have stopped the execution thread (it was running my cpu really bad and my poor laptop fan was working overtime)...but i didn't actually force the application close.
2005-06-17T15:04:00.000Z	tsw	xingmu	I dont think there is an easy (or even hard) way to revover the text..
2005-06-17T15:05:00.000Z	tsw	xingmu	you could check firefox cache to see if theres something
