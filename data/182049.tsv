2006-06-03T10:51:00.000Z	Daverab		Alright, I'm a little clueless on how to do something. I have a share on my Mac (OS X 10.4) and I'd like to pull up that share under Ubuntu. I've tried a few things, like using SharePoints on my Mac to set up a share for an entire external drive, but I feel a bit clueless on where to go from here.

2006-06-03T10:52:00.000Z	Daverab	TigerWolf	I don't want a FTP hookup. I want a nice share I can pull up across the network and just do simple drag and drop.
