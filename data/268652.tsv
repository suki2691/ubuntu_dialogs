2005-01-03T14:54:00.000Z	_iKe_		i'm trying to get my winmodem to work on ubuntu, i've got some instructions but they require me to install this : sudo aptitude install build-essentials , however i cant install it cuz i dont have internet connection on ubuntu, so is there a way to download that package on windows and then install it on ubuntu? thanks a lot.
