2006-07-15T12:25:00.000Z	david__		i asked a long time ago about a progrom to download music and other files for ubuntu... the answer i got was frostwire... is there anything that would be free to download and use?
2006-07-15T12:27:00.000Z	david__		anybody know of a free program that is used for downloading music?
2006-07-15T12:29:00.000Z	david__		lol... a P2P progrom is what i would need... like limewire on windows
2006-07-15T12:30:00.000Z	snoops	david__	 there's umm frostwire I believe which is an opensource implementation of limewire (at least I think that's correct)
