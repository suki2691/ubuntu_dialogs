2010-02-15T02:33:00.000Z	purpzey-is-a-guy		Can someone help me out, I just installed Firefox 3.5.7 from the repos (Shiretoko), but now, any program that calls for my default browser is calling the old version of FireFox.

2010-02-15T02:34:00.000Z	purpzey-is-a-guy	daftykins	Where do I find the default programs app?
2010-02-15T02:34:00.000Z	daftykins	purpzey-is-a-guy	it's off system -> preferences i think
