2011-04-22T11:06:00.000Z	gaelfx	TheWubber	I was looking more for performance rather than an explanation, but thanks
2011-04-22T11:07:00.000Z	TheWubber	gaelfx	apparently linux was the first to have usb3 support
2011-04-22T11:08:00.000Z	gaelfx	TheWubber	yeah, I know it's supported, but I wanna know if performance is anywhere near specs, cause if it's not worth it, I don't wanna put it in my box
