2007-10-18T02:26:00.000Z	Ricket		So what about ubuntu 7.10 will change tomorrow? I just decided to go get it, but then I find out that right now only a release candidate is available and the real one will be out tomorrow... should I wait until tomorrow or go ahead and start the download?
2007-10-18T02:27:00.000Z	matt1	Ricket	it's *nice* to have the 'final' version burned
2007-10-18T02:27:00.000Z	Ricket	matt1	well, i don't even plan on burning this, I'll be using it through a virtual machine, at least for the next few weeks. so anything that changes by tomorrow should just come through synaptic, right?
2007-10-18T02:28:00.000Z	matt1	Ricket	that makes sense... just new synaptic updates
