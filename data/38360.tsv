2010-02-17T03:01:00.000Z	Trek	archboxman	i used the command sudo VISUAL=gedit visudo
2010-02-17T03:02:00.000Z	Trek	archboxman	and I edited /etc/sudoers after this issue had already been detected
2010-02-17T03:05:00.000Z	Trek	archboxman	it works for editing other files as well, and works for all administrative commands
