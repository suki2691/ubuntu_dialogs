2011-11-25T20:09:00.000Z	homegrown		I'm looking to migrate to subversion 1.7, but cannot find any official packages ... why so far behind?
2011-11-25T20:10:00.000Z	Pici	homegrown	Because we don't upgrade packages unless they are security fixes once an Ubuntu release has been finished.
2011-11-25T20:11:00.000Z	Pici	homegrown	And I don't see 1.7 even in debian yet or the in-development release of Ubuntu.  You could try looking for a PPA if you really need it though.
2011-11-25T20:12:00.000Z	homegrown	Pici	Thanks, but it's going to be production, so I'd rather have it stable.... might have to stick to BSD for now then :-(
