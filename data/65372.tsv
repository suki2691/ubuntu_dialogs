2009-03-22T06:14:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	ryanakca	i was searching for an answer to that myself (Similar problem). I found some stuff about buggy ACPI messing things up, and needing to disable it, but that didn't work for me.
2009-03-22T06:14:00.000Z	ryanakca	sprinkmeier	Well, I don't need ACPI on a desktop, so might as well disable it in the bios... but still. This is on a cold boot...
2009-03-22T06:17:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	ryanakca	i though ACPI handles everything from soft-power to fan speeds, so disabling it (even on a desktop) might not be a good idea (unless you're desperate to get wifi :-)
2009-03-22T06:18:00.000Z	ryanakca	sprinkmeier	Oh, nevermind then... I thought it was just for suspend / resume :)
