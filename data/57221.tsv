2009-05-20T08:23:00.000Z	relive		anyone used nfs to transfer a 4 gb folder between two linux system? mine keep on locking up. i don't know why
2009-05-20T08:24:00.000Z	dthacker	relive	I agree with usr13, use scp
2009-05-20T08:25:00.000Z	relive	dthacker	scp wil encrypt data. so a 4gb folder becomes 12 gb  ... maybe
2009-05-20T08:25:00.000Z	dthacker	relive	I don't think so....
