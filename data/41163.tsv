2011-01-31T11:42:00.000Z	Blue11	CaptaiUbi	you want to go from 10.10 to 10.04 if I understand correctly?
2011-01-31T11:43:00.000Z	Blue11	CaptaiUbi	i am confused.  you said you wanted to upgrade 10.04 to 10.10 while 10.10 is running.
2011-01-31T11:44:00.000Z	Blue11	CaptaiUbi	okay not what you posted.  yes it is possible, but i have experienced problems (personally) with upgrading, so I do a fresh install.
