2009-01-31T13:01:00.000Z	Derf_the		hanks Gnea, I have a 'desktop' that is locked -ignores mouse clicks- and will only show the wallpaper, no files are displayed. When I look at the file "desktop" using a file manager everything is still there.  The permissions are the standard 755's and this behaviour was unchanged by the upgradeing from U8.04 to U8.10.  Any hints as to how to get back to normal? [on a HP8510w]
2009-01-31T13:12:00.000Z	Derf_the	Gnea	Hi again , This is my first time here. Will anyone be likly to answer that question of mine now that it has disappeared off the top of the screen some minutes ago?
