2012-04-11T11:55:00.000Z	Zenger	paulus68	I don't want to emulate it with wine. I'm searching a native software, in Windows notepad++ is pure awesomeness :)
2012-04-11T12:09:00.000Z	paulus68	Zenger	what about Scite?
2012-04-11T12:09:00.000Z	Zenger	paulus68	It's the engine upon which notepad++ was build, I will give it a try later , now I'm giving Komodo a try )
