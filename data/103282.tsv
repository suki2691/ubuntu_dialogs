2008-01-21T02:47:00.000Z	LjL	Karyn_bear	by default, there is nothing listening on ports (except one perhaps)... but there is no firewalls actively keeping ports closed, by default.
2008-01-21T02:48:00.000Z	Karyn_bear	LjL	can you setup your linksys router to support WEP AND WPA2?
2008-01-21T02:49:00.000Z	LjL	Karyn_bear	i don't know a thing about linksys routers
