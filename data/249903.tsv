2008-01-03T19:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Paha	 ive noticed with some laptops the special keys like that work..and with others they dont. Ive also noticed that Depending on the video card. the TV if hooked up WHEN the system boots up.. The TV will be enabled.
2008-01-03T19:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Paha	 also you proberly need to have the nvidia drivers installed to allow on the fly setting of the tv out and other settings.
