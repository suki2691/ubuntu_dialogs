2010-01-03T16:52:00.000Z	Sufixx		Hi, I'm looking for a gnome desktop wigdet/gadget that shows a miniature of all worspaces (something big enough to see what windows are open)
2010-01-03T16:52:00.000Z	soreau	Sufixx	There is compiz Expo
2010-01-03T16:53:00.000Z	Sufixx	soreau	yes, but I want it to be just part of the screen, and visible all the time
2010-01-03T16:54:00.000Z	soreau	Sufixx	I don't know of anything that would do something like that
