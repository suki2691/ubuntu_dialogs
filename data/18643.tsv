2012-09-04T21:08:00.000Z	BlackBishop		is there any way I can make ubuntu server (12.04.1) with gnome-core allow a user to connect to whatever wireless network it wants without granting him access to sudo group ?  anybody ? :)
2012-09-04T21:09:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BlackBishop	 sudo access is not needed for wifi, is it?
2012-09-04T21:10:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BlackBishop	 if you connect to a public wifi network in a station or so, you don't have root access, either
2012-09-04T21:13:00.000Z	BlackBishop	MonkeyDust	ok, then why if I try to connect to a password protected network, with a regular ( non-admin ) user, asks me for the password for a user with administrator rights
