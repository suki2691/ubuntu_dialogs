2008-04-06T17:39:00.000Z	truebosko		Hi there .. this is more of a precautionary question. I have Vista and am trying to install Ubuntu on another partition. I noticed in my partitions I have a SWAP and Ext3 partitons already (I used to have Debian) .. These were frmo Debian and are in no way connected to Vista right? Stupid question, but I need to be 100% sure
