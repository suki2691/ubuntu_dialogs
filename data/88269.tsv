2008-06-22T01:12:00.000Z	Led_Zeppelin		I am using wine, but I can't seem to click on any check boxes in the program
2008-06-22T01:13:00.000Z	s0ullight	Led_Zeppelin	were there any .dll errors in the installation?
2008-06-22T01:13:00.000Z	Led_Zeppelin	s0ullight	not sure, I just popped in the cd and ran setup.exe
2008-06-22T01:14:00.000Z	s0ullight	Led_Zeppelin	i would recommend you to try running the app from a gnome-terminal and look for errors
