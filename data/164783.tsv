2007-05-08T12:58:00.000Z	Squirrely_Wrath		One last question.  Is there an easy way to get VLC installed on Ubuntu with all the necessary codecs since ubuntu doesn't support jack squat on the a/v sice of things?
2007-05-08T12:58:00.000Z	Squirrely_Wrath		or even just codecs that work with the built in programs
2007-05-08T12:58:00.000Z	preaction	Squirrely_Wrath	there's an add/remove programs option for restricted formats
