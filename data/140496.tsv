I have looked at iwconfig and everything is set to what it should be. i have connected to other peoples routers when this is happening and received the same slow speeds. The only way of fixing it is to disable networking, remove my wi-fi adaptor and plug it in to a different free usb

2009-03-12T21:17:00.000Z	JensenDied	jamesclayden1983	bleh, i have an ipw2200 intel card, not sure if this is true, but read it since last time i needed to fix my card, try setting the speed lower from the 54mbps to idk, 5.5, supposedly helps with range and connection. sorry if that info is completely wrong
2009-03-12T21:22:00.000Z	JensenDied	jamesclayden1983	ow, well hope someone has some ideas, really only been having similar issues at one location and never been around it enough to try and figure it out
