2010-09-26T04:36:00.000Z	brad_		does anyone know why I have to run dhclient manually on a friend of mine's ubuntu machine to get it to get an ip address?
2010-09-26T04:36:00.000Z	unkmar	brad_	wired or wirelesss?
2010-09-26T04:36:00.000Z	unkmar	brad_	did you connect the wire before or after booting?
2010-09-26T04:37:00.000Z	unkmar	brad_	I assume gnome with its network manager?  Is network enabled and not set to a static IP?
