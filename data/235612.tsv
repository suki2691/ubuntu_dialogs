2005-09-06T10:43:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel		how hard is it, in theory, to compile a kernel? i'd like to get off the generic 386 and make a custom one for my processor
2005-09-06T10:44:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel		P4 1.8
2005-09-06T10:45:00.000Z	Madpilot	Pickle_Weasel	get the 686 kernel for P4s
2005-09-06T10:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	Pickle_Weasel	you'd have to do the same thing for the bits of the kernel you'd need, too...
