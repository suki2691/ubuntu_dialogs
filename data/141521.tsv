2007-04-03T09:50:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	mikebeecham	just open a terminal, the computer name is the bit following the "@" sign
2007-04-03T09:50:00.000Z	mikebeecham	SlimeyPete	How do I change the computer name?
2007-04-03T09:52:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	mikebeecham	erm, I'm not sure how you do it graphically. You can do it by editing the text file called /etc/hostname.
