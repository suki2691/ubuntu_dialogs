A short search on Software Center shows Krecipies, though it looks kinda old. Anyone knows if there's a better program or I should just install that one?

2012-05-26T19:30:00.000Z	Harmonium	compdoc	I have both, but my brother has Unity. I don't think he'd mind installing dependencies as long as he gets his program, though.
