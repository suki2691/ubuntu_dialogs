2005-07-10T15:28:00.000Z	Nikki		I'v brought a laptop and I want to find out information about the hard disk, like its RPM
2005-07-10T15:29:00.000Z	Nikki		but I dont know how to go about it, PS I havent burnt Ubuntu yet so a windows program would be nice, I mean it shouldnt be that hard to find out specs about your HD should it!?
