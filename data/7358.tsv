2011-12-04T06:59:00.000Z	Josh1910		i have my system reserved partition in my "Places" how do i remove it so i never see it again?
2011-12-04T07:00:00.000Z	csolisr	Josh1910	Easy way, enter Nautilus, right-click the partition, click "Remove". If that doesn't work come again.
2011-12-04T07:02:00.000Z	Josh1910	csolisr	the partition is greyed out
2011-12-04T07:02:00.000Z	csolisr	Josh1910	Hmm... In that case, no idea. Any help over here?
