2006-08-07T09:13:00.000Z	nalioth	whatsnfs	the NFS filesystem is native to Unix (ubuntu is considered Unix)
2006-08-07T09:13:00.000Z	nalioth	whatsnfs	if you are planning on sharing with windows machines, use samba
2006-08-07T09:13:00.000Z	whatsnfs	nalioth	but I don't even see NFS in the sharing options
