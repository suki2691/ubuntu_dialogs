2008-12-23T01:46:00.000Z	donavan_		Ok let me try this again ... maybe im not making myself clear.... I have 8.04 running now with all available updates installed .... if I upgrade the OS to 8.10 will I actually get anything new? or were all the updates already taken care of by the update manager within 8.04.  If the only thing I am going to get from the upgrade is a new version number then I'm not going to bother.

2008-12-23T01:46:00.000Z	donavan_	cwillu	thank you
2008-12-23T01:46:00.000Z	cwillu	donavan_	some packages are in the -backports repository, but intrepid has changes under the hood that won't ever be included in an update to 8.04
