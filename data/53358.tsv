2012-10-01T21:07:00.000Z	identity		Hello. I have a fresh installation of 12.04 and want to get dual monitor support with xmonad. It works with unity right now -- but what configuration files is it that this "Displays" configuration utility is modifying to change the monitor layout, exactly?
2012-10-01T21:07:00.000Z	identity		I have an ATI radeon graphics card.

2012-10-01T21:11:00.000Z	identity	rhizmoe	Well, to be honest, I'm not entirely sure where to start. Should I start by getting xmonad functional, and *then* get dual-monitor support from there? What exactly is it that manages stuff like displays -- surely it isn't the window manager?
