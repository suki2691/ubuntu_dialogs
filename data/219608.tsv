2009-03-01T23:25:00.000Z	mleger		HI I have to ask again: I have a HDA Intel card Realtek ID663 chip and cannot get the audio to work on ubuntu Hardy
2009-03-01T23:25:00.000Z	mleger		This is my first time using ubuntu
2009-03-01T23:26:00.000Z	mleger		Anyone could offer assistance? I tried to update all the latest ALSA drivers
