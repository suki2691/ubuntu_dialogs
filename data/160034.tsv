2009-10-17T01:41:00.000Z	flanders	Ronnie	can't he use "gksu gedit /path/to/file" ?
2009-10-17T01:42:00.000Z	flanders	Ronnie	Only thing I can think of, and I'm far from an expert, is to create a remote share, and use gksu gedit on the files.
2009-10-17T01:43:00.000Z	flanders	Ronnie	otherwise, I think you're limited to terminal text editors.
