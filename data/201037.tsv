2006-01-13T11:04:00.000Z	l_lama		does ubuntu support MP3 and MPEG4 playback out of the box ?
2006-01-13T11:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	l_lama	not out of the box
2006-01-13T11:06:00.000Z	l_lama	thoreauputic	and how could I get them ? by apt-getting something from some section of ubuntu (like non-free in debian) ?
