2006-07-03T15:44:00.000Z	pete27		I've been interested in trying Ubuntu lately
2006-07-03T15:44:00.000Z	pete27		and I have a question about Kubuntu vs. Ubuntu
2006-07-03T15:44:00.000Z	lemur	pete27	it's not really a "vs" relationship :)

The two distros differ just slightly in package configuration, so you get some different apps, but the base is fundamentally the same
