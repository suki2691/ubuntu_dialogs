2008-12-18T11:15:00.000Z	MrWizeGuy1983	\\`oot	kinda, firefox has the default plugin and installs flash for you when prompted
2008-12-18T11:16:00.000Z	\\`oot	keepsake	OK... I've hit a page with a bunch of .swf file, but when I click them FireFox wants to download 'em?
2008-12-18T11:16:00.000Z	MrWizeGuy1983	\\`oot	go to youtube and it will ask you to install flash
