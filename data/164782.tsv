2007-10-07T05:15:00.000Z	klotho		hello...  can I run ubuntu within windows for free by downloading the free vmware player and an ubuntu appliance?
2007-10-07T05:16:00.000Z	preaction	klotho	sure. you could even use wubi to install ubuntu as a file inside of windows
2007-10-07T05:17:00.000Z	preaction	klotho	nope. but you do need to reboot to get into ubuntu (it uses WinXP's bootloader)
2007-10-07T05:19:00.000Z	preaction	klotho	then you want VMWare, or VirtualBox (which is legally unencombered from what I hear)
