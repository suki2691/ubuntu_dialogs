2010-12-14T11:42:00.000Z	S_A		Hi! I want to your generic user's views about Ubuntu 10.10 on atom processor. One of my friend installed and he is facing lot of issues at boot time (manual enter button press needed multiple times), slugishness in display etc
2010-12-14T11:42:00.000Z	S_A		alos the boot time is very long
2010-12-14T11:43:00.000Z	S_A		although I was expecting it to be around 10 seconds to dsktop
