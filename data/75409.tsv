2009-07-12T06:56:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Okay	you should be able to mod the Tx power
2009-07-12T06:58:00.000Z	Okay	Out_Cold	do you know how to mod the Tx power and are there risks?
2009-07-12T06:59:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Okay	you can google it. I'm not sure if mod-ing the tx power can burn out a card.. but you can set it via command line
