2010-05-08T15:42:00.000Z	Xethron		Hey, I have a really old PC and I was wondering if it would be a good idea to install Ubuntu onto it. I am currently running the live CD but its really slow. I dont know where to check for specs, but its roughly a AMD Duron 900MHz with just above 300mb ram, and 10 GB HDD space

2010-05-08T15:44:00.000Z	Xethron		Because I dont really have the internet to download abother CD... hehe
