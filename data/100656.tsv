2008-02-16T01:24:00.000Z	davmonster		Hi, I have a question.. how do I upgrade to the lastest version of a package?
2008-02-16T01:25:00.000Z	davmonster		I know apt-get update updates everything
2008-02-16T01:25:00.000Z	davmonster		but for some reason it's not actually updating this package that I want it to
