2008-11-02T01:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	billybigrigger	 cups is the printing service.. :) so its basicially the only way to go.. combo of cups+samba will be needed most likely
2009-01-05T22:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	billybigrigger	 i just install the 'ubuntu-restricted-extras' package and it installs flash and java..  ive not had to 'tweak/work/mess' with those in ages.
