2009-05-30T04:07:00.000Z	Zzeiss	ZykoticK9	there was as of late last week.  :(  (but "rmmod kvm_intel" then "rmmod kvm" does the trick)
2009-05-30T04:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Zzeiss	not a problem i'm having but i don't use kvm in any way anymore - use too, but recent VB releases have been amazing
2009-05-30T04:08:00.000Z	Zzeiss	ZykoticK9	Yeah.  kvm is left in the dust.  *sigh*
