2008-05-16T07:36:00.000Z	AndyMan1		I want to set up an encrypted disk with the alternate CD, if i set up a keyfile on a usb drive, will i need to keep it plugged in constantly, or should i be able to remove it after boot?

2008-05-16T07:37:00.000Z	AndyMan1	wols	"not" as in i should be able to unplug?
2008-05-16T07:38:00.000Z	wols_	AndyMan1	yes. usually the key is read into memory
