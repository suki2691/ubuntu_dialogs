2006-08-08T09:12:00.000Z	flj^		wondering why Ubuntu 6.06 wont see any USB devices or detect my onboard ethernet controller
2006-08-08T09:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	flj^	What chipset is the onboard controller
2006-08-08T09:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	flj^	Minor at best plus it brings other issues
2006-08-08T09:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	flj^	that is the model of the mb not the chipset for the lan .. although via is still part of it
