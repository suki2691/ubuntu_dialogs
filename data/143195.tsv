2007-03-13T06:54:00.000Z	dyrne	Xeper	i havent used gdm in a while but on one of the tabs is the system login sound
2007-03-13T06:56:00.000Z	Xeper	dyrne	I can't get GDM working, as I can't even complete an install at this point.  That's why I was asking if anyone was running the chipset... to see if anyone had successfully done it, and if so, if I could ascertain how they did it.
