2006-09-22T08:19:00.000Z	dren		Hello. I just installed Ubuntu (6.06) and I created the user and pass of "root" and "root" (both the same) and now I can't log into ubuntu when it starts up. What do I do?
2006-09-22T08:20:00.000Z	dren		"root" (no quotes)

2006-09-22T08:21:00.000Z	kitche	dren	your best bet would be a reinstall
