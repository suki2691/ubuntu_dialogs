2007-06-23T06:02:00.000Z	Psykus		are there any other decent gui irc clients available for ubuntu? xchat is ok, but I hate the theming options, so hard to change anything
2007-06-23T06:02:00.000Z	scorp123	Psykus	I use "konversation" .... simple and easy to use. I know: it's KDE ... but it works under GNOME just as well.
2007-06-23T06:03:00.000Z	Psykus		also anyway to change/disable the tooltips? even after changing themes around, they still show up as an ugly yellow color
2007-06-23T06:03:00.000Z	Psykus	scorp123	thanks
