2010-12-25T00:52:00.000Z	bioz		hi, I have - maybe small - problem which I can't force myself:/. It's about configuring SMB to get a computer with Ubuntu connected with a computer with WinXP (I need to download files from a cpu with Ubuntu to the another one). Could anyone help me configuring this, or maybe someone knows the full tutorial to enjoy just this one feature? I'm lame, fyi.

2010-12-25T00:52:00.000Z	bioz		I have now these computers connected ad hoc, and at the same time one of them is connected to the router with a wire, and second one is using wireless connection. They are connected to the router because I need to get some help while configuring samba;).
