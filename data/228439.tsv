2005-07-11T09:59:00.000Z	JesusOfSuburbia		I was wondering if Ubuntu has any built in Server Tools, and if not what tools would be reccomended
2005-07-11T09:59:00.000Z	Xenguy	JesusOfSuburbia	example?
2005-07-11T10:00:00.000Z	JesusOfSuburbia	Xenguy	What do you mean? I want to run it off a Pentium II 266mhz, but it dont want to go through the hassle of installing it unless i can use it as a server
2005-07-11T10:01:00.000Z	Xenguy	JesusOfSuburbia	no, what do you mean? The question was one of clarification :-) Linux is perfect for a server, but again, details would help.  For example, what service(s) do you want to run?
