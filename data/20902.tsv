2011-01-11T03:35:00.000Z	Nanoha		when using the `date + %a`  I thought that was supposed to give me the full date, not only just "Mon".
2011-01-11T03:35:00.000Z	Myrtti	Nanoha	I'd personally go for %F
2011-01-11T03:37:00.000Z	Nanoha	Myrtti	does the `date` only work in a bash script or can i execute that at a command prompt?
