2008-04-27T12:26:00.000Z	yedday		If I have Date in textform of: account[1] \n element[1] value[1] \n element[7] value[7] \n element[5] value[5] \n ... account[2] How could I best parse this into a database? I mean, the element/value pairs are unsorted and not every account has every element(field has to be left blank then)
