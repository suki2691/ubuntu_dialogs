2010-06-09T19:02:00.000Z	maco	simps	canonical (the company behind ubuntu) gets money from selling training and support contracts and from being contracted by hardware manufacturers to make drivers for their hardware
2010-06-09T19:03:00.000Z	maco	simps	the majority of ubuntu developers are unpaid volunteers
2010-06-09T19:03:00.000Z	maco	simps	however, launchpad.net is mostly paid canonical employees
