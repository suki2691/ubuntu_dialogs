2008-12-21T07:52:00.000Z	sayeghr		Hey gang, I have a question. I'm trying to upgrade from 7.04 to 7.1 but I'm getting issues because I suspect that the feisty repositories are no longer there... What do I do? I tried upgrading using the 7.1 alternate cd but it fails on me too.
2008-12-21T07:53:00.000Z	sayeghr		Anyone know how to get upgrading working with 7.04 to 7.1? Or is it broken now that 7.04 isn't supported?
2008-12-21T07:54:00.000Z	FAJ	sayeghr	 it shouldn't be 'broken' but installing 8.04 from an alternateive maybe?
2008-12-21T07:55:00.000Z	FAJ	sayeghr	 clean installs aren't bad?  it would help improve system speed etc.
