2005-12-05T12:16:00.000Z	mpma		I'm struggling with ndiswrapper and wifi... it was working now it isn't.... I'm getting "no such device" errors... is anyone familar with this?  should I just get a new wifi card?  any thoughts?  I installed ndiswrapper from source, via a debian as recommended on a wiki ubuntu page.... I'm not sure what the problem is...
2005-12-05T12:16:00.000Z	Kensey	mpma	what kind of NDIS device?
2005-12-05T12:19:00.000Z	Kensey	mpma	does it show up when you run lspci?
2005-12-05T12:24:00.000Z	Kensey	mpma	that is odd.
