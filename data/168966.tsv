2006-09-02T11:59:00.000Z	MetaMorfoziS		but you need backup that first: sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf_original and then edit: sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-09-02T11:59:00.000Z	d00mik[u] 	MetaMorfoziS	in what line ? I have few lines with "Modes  "1280x1024" "1024x768" "832x624" "800x600" "720x400" "640x480""
