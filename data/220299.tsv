2006-10-03T05:28:00.000Z	Gia		I have apache 2.0 installed on my ubuntu-server... but when I try to go to the website, all I get is a "Index of" listing in my browser...
2006-10-03T05:28:00.000Z	Flannel	Gia	what do you have in /var/www?
2006-10-03T05:29:00.000Z	Flannel	Gia	or rather, what have you put into /var/www/?  since an index of is default
