2010-01-22T05:24:00.000Z	kyle6513		Can anyone help me setting up my laptop to display 1024x768 instead of 1024x600? intel graphics on eeepc
2010-01-22T05:25:00.000Z	unop	kyle6513	can your eepc even support that resolution?
2010-01-22T05:25:00.000Z	kyle6513	unop	does under windows. it just stretches the display
