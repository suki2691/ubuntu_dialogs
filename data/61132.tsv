2009-04-01T10:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Halluzination	they are just differnet desktop environments
2009-04-01T10:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Halluzination	there isn't really a big difference as such
2009-04-01T10:20:00.000Z	Halluzination	sebsebseb	right, i understand the difference in apps and they are envs, but there is no difference other than that? like.. any advantages/disadvantages of either one? I'm guessing GNOME is more popular than KDE, right?
