2005-06-09T07:05:00.000Z	blueskiesokie		what is the deal here with ubuntu? i know that is supports my hardware and all but all it is getting is 640x480 resolution ?
2005-06-09T07:05:00.000Z	blueskiesokie		i tried setting the xorg.conf to use only 800X600 and 1024x768 .. still only doing 640x480 resolution?
2005-06-09T07:06:00.000Z	blueskiesokie		this is very frustrating . I like the OS and all but i hate 640x480 resolution ?
