2006-10-08T07:52:00.000Z	meatface		I am having an issue with the gui freezing at boot. Everything is good until I login. After the login screen the music is playing until the deskto is about half loaded. Then the music cuts and the desktop stops loading. I can move the cursor but cannot click anything along the top panel. If I disable sound in user privliges then everything boots fine. Anybody have any ideas, this is making me crazy.
