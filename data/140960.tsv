2011-05-31T19:58:00.000Z	b__		Hi there: Is there any reason why I should install ubuntu 10.04 instead of 10.10?
2011-05-31T19:59:00.000Z	Dulak	b__	depends on what you are doing with the computer really.  I stay on LTS releases myself but I don't have to have all the latest stuff.
2011-05-31T20:01:00.000Z	b__	Dulak	I just want it to be fast and stable.
2011-05-31T20:01:00.000Z	Dulak	b__	stick to 10.04 for now then if you want stable
