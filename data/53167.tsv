2009-07-04T04:41:00.000Z	LasBSD		is there an easy way to instal a package to a specific place? I want to play freeciv but my SSD reads at annoyingly slow speeds
2009-07-04T04:41:00.000Z	Bejeezus	LasBSD	isn't that the opposite of what an SSD is supposed to do
2009-07-04T04:42:00.000Z	LasBSD	Bejeezus	this is a netbook
2009-07-04T04:42:00.000Z	LasBSD	Bejeezus	it should be faster, but it's really just cheaper :)
