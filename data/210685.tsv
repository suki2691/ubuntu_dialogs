2006-10-26T06:44:00.000Z	Dark_L0rd		hello guys
2006-10-26T06:44:00.000Z	Dark_L0rd		i need some rule that will allow me to make my box, using iptables rules, to force target where it lands when asks for a specific domain
2006-10-26T06:44:00.000Z	Dark_L0rd		to be more specific, i want when my box does ask for data from for example:   IP1:80 to be redirected automatically and by local rules, to connect to IP2:8080 for example
2006-10-26T06:45:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Dark_L0rd	you'd be best of asking elsewhere, I think...
