2007-10-22T02:28:00.000Z	MSTK		can anyone help me get my desktop back up and running?  I think I might haev accidentally deleted a startup process or something, because nautilus doesn't launch and all that is on my desktop is the wallpaper

2007-10-22T02:30:00.000Z	MSTK	MasterShrek	- thanks, I'll try that.  But I"m pretty sure it might be something I did with the startup process.  I was trying to "embed" a shell onto the desktop, which involved taking out the items.  but i'm not sure how to reenable them now.  it's probably just a simple process
2007-10-22T02:30:00.000Z	MasterShrek	MSTK	probably, but i wouldnt know where to look
