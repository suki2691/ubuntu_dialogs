2005-10-20T16:28:00.000Z	topyli	helloyo	you have packages from before the release
2005-10-20T16:29:00.000Z	helloyo	topyli	just i dont remember this being the case with hoary
2005-10-20T16:30:00.000Z	topyli	helloyo	i remember differently. a lot of updates just around release time. just apply them and things will settle down
