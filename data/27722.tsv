2010-08-08T07:23:00.000Z	blackarray		Ubuntu Programming question to anyone who may have any ideas. I'm writing a program and I'm looking to include my own sort of Status Notifications as is seen in 10.04 with Gwibber, Empathy, ETC. Anyone know where I could go to find out more about how that is done?
