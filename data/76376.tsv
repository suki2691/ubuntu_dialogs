2008-10-27T09:40:00.000Z	cabrioleur	itai_michaelson	yes. guests are saved in separate files, so it won't be a problem.
2008-10-27T09:41:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	cabrioleur	i'm upgrading from gutsy to ibex , will the different version of  vmware make any difference?
2008-10-27T09:41:00.000Z	cabrioleur	itai_michaelson	no, images are compatible.
