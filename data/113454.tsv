2009-09-07T20:30:00.000Z	Keiffer		Hi. Anyone knows how could I make Transmission start before the login screen? And start downloading and uploading. Is this possible?
2009-09-07T20:30:00.000Z	Keiffer		I have multiple users on the pc and I want that transmission to be open no matter what.
2009-09-07T20:32:00.000Z	Keiffer		do you know any screenlet/desklet that works as a menu for apps? like the Mac OS one.
