2008-08-06T21:32:00.000Z	ViperBorg[WinDoz		Okay, I have a few questions here if anyone can help me.
2008-08-06T21:34:00.000Z	ViperBorg[WinDoz		I downloaded the latest Ubuntu, and I want to go ahead and install it from the live CD, but I want to keep a partition for Windows (sadly, I need it) if I click on Install on the Live CD, will it give me the option of creating a new partition for the installation, and how do I fix the boot.ini for Vista for it to find it and make it an option at startup to boot Ubuntu?
2008-08-06T21:34:00.000Z	ViperBorg[WinDoz		Excellent. Thank you very much.
