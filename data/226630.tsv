2005-08-07T07:35:00.000Z	FatManWalking		I want to use gtkpod.  I need to load libid3tag.  I downloaded libid3tag0_0.15.1b-7_i386.deb,  but now I don't know how to install it.  Help.
2005-08-07T07:37:00.000Z	FatManWalking		I have synaptic.
2005-08-07T07:39:00.000Z	FatManWalking		I really don't know how to use synaptic.  I searched for gtkpod in synaptic, and clicked it for install.  That is when it gave me the dependency error.  I down loaded the package, and I don't know how to get it into synaptic.
