2005-11-07T08:46:00.000Z	beezly		i'm in a meeting soon at work about what linux distro we pick as our "enterprise" server distribution - and I'm keen to promote ubuntu - can any one point me in a direction of information advocating ubuntu to enterprises
2005-11-07T08:47:00.000Z	MarcN	beezly	the key to 'enterprise' is support.  Does UbuntuLinux Inc now provide 365 24x7 support?  I just don't know.
2005-11-07T08:51:00.000Z	beezly	MarcN	according to the website, Canonical do provide support
2005-11-07T08:51:00.000Z	MarcN	beezly	then give it a try.  Another thing to consider is hw support.
