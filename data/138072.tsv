2009-09-21T02:10:00.000Z	rocknblogger		I have a Windows 7 set up in Raid 0, I want to install Ubuntu but don't care if it's in Raid, can I install it to a 3rd drive without loss of any Windows files and still be able to dual boot both?

2009-09-21T02:12:00.000Z	usser	rocknblogger	you can remove your raided drives and plug in that 3rd one and install ubuntu as if theres only drive in the system, then plug windows drives back in and use bios to choose which hdd to boot
