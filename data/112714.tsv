2007-11-29T06:54:00.000Z	sjhiz		can anyone tell me how to install afile with a ".sh" extension?
2007-11-29T06:55:00.000Z	sjhiz		just type that into konsole?
2007-11-29T06:57:00.000Z	sjhiz		I tried that code and got this prompt "chmod: missing operand after `+x'"
2007-11-29T06:58:00.000Z	fragile	sjhiz	chmod +x filename.sh gives you that error?
