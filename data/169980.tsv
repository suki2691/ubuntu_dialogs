2007-04-15T15:41:00.000Z	Raz		Anyone help me with an Ubuntu install? I have 6.10 normal and alt, 7.04, and I get bizarre, different errors with everything I do
2007-04-15T15:42:00.000Z	Raz		It's a new computer with recent parts so I had to get the newer kernel to support my hardware

2007-04-15T15:43:00.000Z	tjcarter	Raz	it's possible, but do you need something newer than 2.6.17 for a particular purpose?
