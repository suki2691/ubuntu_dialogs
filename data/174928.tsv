2006-07-14T11:15:00.000Z	Warbo	dou	I have found it unresponsive recently. Ubuntu developers are always trying to incorporate the most wanted stuff though
2006-07-14T11:16:00.000Z	dou	Warbo	ftp://ftp.free.fr/pub/Distributions_Linux/plf/ which was the place where ubuntu was isnt there anymore
2006-07-14T11:16:00.000Z	Warbo	dou	No wonder it has been giving errors in aptitude :)
