2008-02-20T04:45:00.000Z	Sandra24		On windows I often use telnet to connect to a port just to see if there is indeed a server listening there. How can I do this on linux?
2008-02-20T04:45:00.000Z	mssever	Sandra24	type telnet host port
2008-02-20T04:46:00.000Z	mssever	Sandra24	Well, sudo aptitude install telnet, I guess
