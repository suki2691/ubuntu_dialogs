2006-01-05T06:41:00.000Z	Thunderguy		Hey, I was gonna compile that new Firefox 1.5, so first I have to remove Firefox right? but when I go to remove firefox it tells me that it will also have to remove ubuntu-desktop because of the dependencies ?!?!
2006-01-05T06:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	Thunderguy	ubuntu-desktop is a meta-package no harm in removing it
2006-01-05T06:44:00.000Z	Thunderguy	erUSUL	Right, but say if I ever do want to remove ubuntu-desktop, is there a problem if the meta-package is already gone?
2006-01-05T06:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Thunderguy	i can not know for sure maybe when you upgrtade to dapper. chec the wiki there is how to to install ff 1.5
