2011-09-16T13:04:00.000Z	Galerien		Hi everyone, I installed the beta ubuntu 11.10 and I have a problem with the terminal, it doesn't appear when I launch it... It's like a completely transparent window. I can tip on it, click and stuff, but I can't see anything except for the mac-like bare unity is using for everything now on the top left corner... can someone help me ?
