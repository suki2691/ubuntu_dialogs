2012-03-28T02:58:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	f3ck4r	that would be interesting except it is based around apps that have power saving inhibition issues. In my case I would have to add every single app installed to my PC as this happens no matter what I am doing. I thought there was something I could do inside my bios or Ubuntu settings or something to prevent this.
