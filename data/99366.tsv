2009-06-08T16:43:00.000Z	blekos		hello, I am a new user and have installed ubuntu on my netbook. Could anyone tell me if ubuntu has less power consumption than kubuntu/
2009-06-08T16:43:00.000Z	blekos		?
2009-06-08T16:44:00.000Z	blekos		so, if I have both installed would make no real difference as to the performance and battery consumption
