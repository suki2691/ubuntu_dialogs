2008-03-07T08:04:00.000Z	Azodon		i can currently use VNC to login from a windows computer to my current desktop ( the one i am logged in on) and take control of it.  Is there a way to allow multiple X logins. So someone can still sit at the machine.

2008-03-07T08:07:00.000Z	flacom	Azodon	if u need 'n' X sessions... I think is for the port  number... example... 192.168.2.2:9001 is one session.. 192.168.2.2:9002 is another session... 192.168.2.2:9003 is the third session
