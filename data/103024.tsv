2008-10-03T05:04:00.000Z	Luminerd__		I would really appreciate some help hare. I have a lexmark copy machine. I have connected to it but it only prints gibberish. Lexmark site has no ubuntu driver...
2008-10-03T05:06:00.000Z	Luminerd__		Can any one please help me figure out this lexmark printer issue?
2008-10-03T05:08:00.000Z	Luminerd__		Histo I have already set it up though.... It does not print right!! Just gibberish
2008-10-03T05:09:00.000Z	histo	Luminerd__	perhaps there is a bug with the drivers or you need to try different ones.
