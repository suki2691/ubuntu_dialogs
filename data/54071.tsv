2010-06-18T02:21:00.000Z	lawrence		I was running Ubuntu Linux (Wubiinstalled) and my PC lost power and now I cannot get back into it.  I get an install error something about power management.
2010-06-18T02:22:00.000Z	Heebie	lawrence	an install error?  Have you tried booting off of a rescue disk and doing an fsck on every filesystem?
2010-06-18T02:23:00.000Z	Heebie	lawrence	Sounds like filesystem corruption that wasn't "caught" by an fsck. :/  Re-installing the stuff that's borked will probably fix it. (just the packages that the damaged files belong to.. so power management stuff.)
