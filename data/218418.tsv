2005-09-21T16:39:00.000Z	Zaacc		hello I was wondering, can Ubuntu be installed onto a Pentuim-MMX 233 Mhz ? :)
2005-09-21T16:39:00.000Z	Seveas	Zaacc	yes it can
2005-09-21T16:41:00.000Z	Zaacc	Seveas	I get the Debootstrap error and I've been told that my hardware is too old, I've tried everything that the forums has told me to try, I can't think of anything more to try :(
2005-09-21T16:41:00.000Z	Seveas	Zaacc	a bit more info might help (like the complete error)
