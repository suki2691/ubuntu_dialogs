2006-08-29T08:08:00.000Z	JKing		I recently acquired some hardware that allows me to use use Ubuntu effectively (yaye!), but I've yet to find a messaging client I find sufficient.  I'm looking for something that is either Jabber-capable or Jabber-centric, with the roster and conversations in the same window, much like your typical IRC client.
2006-08-29T08:08:00.000Z	JKing		So, I was wondering if more knowledgable minds had any ideas.
2006-08-29T08:08:00.000Z	WineO	JKing	Gaim should do it
2006-08-29T08:09:00.000Z	JKing	WineO	Yes?  Perhaps I didn't look at the settings closely enough...
