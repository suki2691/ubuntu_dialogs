2008-05-20T22:43:00.000Z	embrik		Using debian hardy - connected a usb-printer (HP 1020) Cups finds the printer and drivers, and everything is just fine - but I can't print. The very first time I did it, I sent a test-print. The printer was out of paper- I didn't find any paper and later when I tried to print again, nothing happens
2008-05-20T22:43:00.000Z	Brent^	embrik	did you try hitting the "load paper" button on the printer?
2008-05-20T22:46:00.000Z	embrik	Brent^	There aren't any load paper button
2008-05-20T22:47:00.000Z	embrik	Brent^	could it have anything to do with permissions - I'm new to ubuntu - been on debian before
