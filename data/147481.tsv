2007-01-29T06:38:00.000Z	Cryoniq		Hmm this is really confusing me with Azureus.. I set it to use ports 49152-50000. I forwarded those in firewall to correct IP. I also had another machine with bittorrent using 50001-50500 etc. So.. now I removed the later, and then the first ones azureues tell me that it has a firewall problem.. lol
