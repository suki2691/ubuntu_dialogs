2006-03-31T14:25:00.000Z	grndslm		i really need some help....i emptied out my trash can, and apparently the contents on my desktop were inside it....i assure you i never dragged it there, not even accidentally, anyway....now everything's gone
2006-03-31T14:26:00.000Z	grndslm		can i get anything back, or is it hopeless....i take it the trash can uses the rm command or hopefully some other method????
2006-03-31T14:27:00.000Z	grndslm		nobody has ANY words of advice for recovering accidentally deleted files?
