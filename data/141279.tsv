2007-03-28T07:18:00.000Z	LjL	kargedan	no idea, i know we have Octave in the repositories, an open source matlab clone
2007-03-28T07:19:00.000Z	kargedan	LjL	yeah but I need some of the toolboxes that matlab uses. I know it will work on a pc. however intel macs are having porbs with matlab and osx
2007-03-28T07:21:00.000Z	kargedan	LjL	know anywhere else that I can ask?
