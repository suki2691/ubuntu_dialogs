2010-03-12T17:05:00.000Z	Gnoxter		Got some Problem, noone could help me so I am here to ask
2010-03-12T17:07:00.000Z	Gnoxter		I brought a netbook a week ago it came with win7 starter. So I just tried to install ubuntu for dualboot. I set up a live-USB using UNetBootin. So then I booted form it and Got the Problem, that the installler did not find the Win7 Part. It didn't find any Partition so I set up the USB a second and third time but it always detected only an empty HDD. What shall I do`?
2010-03-12T17:09:00.000Z	Emanon	Gnoxter	try going to windows side defragging and resizing the partition from that side
