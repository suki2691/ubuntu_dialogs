2011-05-05T06:34:00.000Z	rlcarr		I am upgrading from 10.04.2 to 10.10.  Upgrade went fine until libdevmapper upgrade.  Has been sitting there with CPU pegged at 70% for 30 minutes.  Any way to restart the upgrade/try again?
2011-05-05T06:35:00.000Z	hiexpo	rlcarr	just stay with 10.04 it is lts
2011-05-05T06:36:00.000Z	rlcarr	hiexpo	it's a desktop and I'm trying to get it up to 11.04.  Anyway, I've already started the upgrade.  It's partway through and has already installed a lot of things.
2011-05-05T06:37:00.000Z	hiexpo	rlcarr	ok unfortunately you will be sorry    10.04 is the best one right now
