2008-04-26T07:38:00.000Z	dudus		Does anyone know why someone with a 64bits pc would rather install the 32bits ubuntu version?
2008-04-26T07:38:00.000Z	Starnestommy	dudus	programs are more compatible with 32-bit OSes, although I have had very few prob;ems with 64-bit
2008-04-26T07:39:00.000Z	dudus	Starnestommy	what kind of problems do u have?
2008-04-26T07:39:00.000Z	Starnestommy	dudus	the only big one was java, but I was easily able to install a 32-bit version of firefox
