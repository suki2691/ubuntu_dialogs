2008-08-08T01:31:00.000Z	Mark_vH		hi, i'm trying to setup ubuntu on a disk that had bad sectors, using the alternative cd. It refuses to do the partitioning
2008-08-08T01:32:00.000Z	Mark_vH		How can I install ubuntu on this disk (as dualboot with the already existing WinXP?)
2008-08-08T01:34:00.000Z	Mark_vH		but wubi will be slower right?
2008-08-08T01:34:00.000Z	spuddys	Mark_vH	i installed over wubi not a problem
