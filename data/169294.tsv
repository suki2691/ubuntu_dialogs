2006-09-17T06:26:00.000Z	Aspicus		quick question. more a general linux one than ubuntu.  i'm trying out a few distributions on a system with XP, ubuntu + 1 other linux distro.  is it safe/wise to just have one share partition for ubuntu and the other linux distro, or do i really need to set up one swap partition each?
2006-09-17T06:26:00.000Z	Aspicus		*share partition should read swap partition
