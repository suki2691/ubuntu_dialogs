2010-10-23T00:36:00.000Z	alkemann		what is the easies way of installing php 5.3.3 on ubuntu ( i would rather not compile, and the api-get stuff are just 5,3,2)
2010-10-23T00:37:00.000Z	will-s	alkemann	The PHP 5 version in Ubuntu 10.10 is 5.3.3. Which Ubuntu version are you using?
2010-10-23T00:38:00.000Z	alkemann	will-s	10.04, because i had to reinstall to it after an upgrade to 10.10 broke my machine down
