2007-04-09T11:38:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Crazytom	Yeah, he also said his computer was sharing wifi somehow.. kinda confusing what hea actually meant :)
2007-04-09T11:38:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Crazytom	I'm guessing he has a router with inbuilt wifi and after a reinstall DHCP will make everything work. Hope I'm right...
