2010-11-14T13:20:00.000Z	[deXter]	ShayGuy	Funny, my laptop just died today as well..  (well, HDD to be exact)
2010-11-14T13:20:00.000Z	ShayGuy		And I'm no closer to solving it than I was when I woke up today.
2010-11-14T13:20:00.000Z	ShayGuy	[deXter]	Well, the battery died. No almost-dead warning, just went out.
