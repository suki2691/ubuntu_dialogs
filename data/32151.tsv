2010-05-10T20:09:00.000Z	ffsdftrr		why ubuntu maintainers are such slackers? i've sent a trivial patch yesterday morning and it still not committed
2010-05-10T20:09:00.000Z	slacker_nl	ffsdftrr	did you attach the patch to an LP bug?
2010-05-10T20:10:00.000Z	ffsdftrr	slacker_nl	yes
2010-05-10T20:10:00.000Z	slacker_nl	ffsdftrr	you could also mail ubuntu-motu to get some attention
