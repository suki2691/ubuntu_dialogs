2007-12-31T02:57:00.000Z	sir_diplomatico		I plugged in my USB headset, everything works fine but when I use the volume control on my headset..... it changes the Microphone volume rather than the SPeaker volume (since it's listed first in Gnome Volume Control)
2007-12-31T02:57:00.000Z	sir_diplomatico		 Is there possibly a way to switch the order of items so that the hardware volume control changes "Speaker" volume rather than "Microphone"?
