2007-02-27T17:02:00.000Z	Mach3		I have to register (by MAC addr) to get on the network at my school.  But i've learned that linux gives a different ip address than windows.  Any way i can set it to be the same, so that i dont have to re-register everytime i switch OSs?
2007-02-27T17:02:00.000Z	orionrobots	Mach3	Is this a static or dhcp address?
