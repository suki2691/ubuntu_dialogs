2006-05-30T14:32:00.000Z	s00ty		In a network with linux and windows machines, is it better to create shared file-storing partitions  in ext3 or ntfs?
2006-05-30T14:33:00.000Z	Spec	s00ty	in linux you can read/write to ntfs via captive-ntfs
2006-05-30T14:35:00.000Z	Spec	s00ty	I think they're comprable -- you should use both, right?
2006-05-30T14:36:00.000Z	Spec	s00ty	If you really wanted to you could make a fat32/vfat partition
