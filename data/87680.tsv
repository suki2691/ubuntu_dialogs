2008-06-14T22:30:00.000Z	iandouglas		hey all, question about upgrading -- I upgraded successfully last night from 7.04 to 7.10, then tried the 7.10 -> 804 upgrade using the "Update Manager" but it failed just before the "clean up" stage -- how do I manually run the upgrade program again, or get a list of what needs to be cleaned up?

2008-06-14T22:32:00.000Z	iandouglas	offby1	yeah, I suppose that's one answer to it, but I don't really feel like reinstalling the entire OS and then having to remember which utilities I use etc
2008-06-14T22:32:00.000Z	offby1	iandouglas	I know.  It's a pain :-|
