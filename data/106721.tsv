2009-06-02T17:28:00.000Z	LukaszJ		 I've got a weird problem with Amarok. Well, I'm using the latest stable Ubuntu Jaunty and Amarok loads all fine, but when I go to the Configuration--> "Internet Services" and click on plugins configuartions panels they won't load but rather stay empty. Have no idea how to deal with this
