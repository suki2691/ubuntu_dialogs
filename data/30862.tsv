2010-10-10T04:53:00.000Z	fiber		Hi, I'm trying to boot into the new 10.10 liveCD, but when I do the boot hangs with the error http://pastebin.com/ePMbtx3L .  I've asked dr. google and it seems the problem has to do with dmraid, so i disconnected all my raid devices but this still happens!  does anyone have an idea as to what is happening?

2010-10-10T04:56:00.000Z	fiber	gbillings	i've checked the md5sum's and they work out.... also i've tried with 3 different USB keys, currently with a lexar one
2010-10-10T04:57:00.000Z	fiber	gbillings	 i've tried with two lexars and one kingston keys... all give the same problems
