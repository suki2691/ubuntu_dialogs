2007-05-04T14:10:00.000Z	MFen		Can someone tell me how i can UN-flag a package as "automatically installed"?
2007-05-04T14:11:00.000Z	MFen		i have installed openoffice.org 2.2 official from the openoffice.org site (because ubuntu's packages are broken!) and now about half of those packages, installed manually, say "automatically installed" and it keeps offering to remove them
2007-05-04T14:13:00.000Z	Raptor45	MFen	by installing them manually they won't be marked as auto-installed, and so won't be auto-removed
2007-05-04T14:13:00.000Z	MFen	Raptor45	i did install them manually in the first place. it says this anyway.
