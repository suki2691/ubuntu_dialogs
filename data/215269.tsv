2006-10-26T06:05:00.000Z	zircx		what file systems do people prefer? ext2 / ext3 or reiserfs?
2006-10-26T06:06:00.000Z	zircx		I've normally used reiserfs.. I might have to do an install with ext3
2006-10-26T06:06:00.000Z	soundray	zircx	ext3. reiserfs is not receiving much development attention since reiser4 is out. Reiser4 is highly controversial.
