2010-07-30T16:53:00.000Z	latitudec600		i installed lucid on my 9 year old PIII laptop and, in order to boot other distros from USB, I successfully installed plop boot manager and edited the grub.cfg. Upon powering on my laptop I select the Plop Boot Manager option from grub. the Plop Boot Manager loads and presents me with the option to boot from USB, I selected it but the pendrive does not boot.
2010-07-30T16:54:00.000Z	latitudec600		I have to say that the pen drive does boot on other machines that have USB boot support in the bios. My old PIII laptop's bios does not support booting from USB. That is why i installed PLOP Boot manager on it. Can anyone help?
