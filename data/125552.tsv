2007-10-27T15:41:00.000Z	ifireball	h4L1m	it can be a video memory thing, I found it this sometimes happens when I have many windows open, somtetimes just logging in and out solves it
2007-10-27T15:42:00.000Z	ifireball	h4L1m	you see in desktop effects mode, each window is placed in the GFX card's memory, and a full-screen window needs a lot of it
2007-10-27T15:45:00.000Z	h4L1m	ifireball	ok, but is it possible to run the videos with the desktop effects?
