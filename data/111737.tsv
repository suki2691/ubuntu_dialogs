2011-07-16T00:53:00.000Z	aidan_follestad		I'm running Ubuntu 11.04 on a 64-bit Dell Inspiron 1440; I can connect to both wifi and ethernet successfully, however my udev rules seem to specify my wlan interface as ethernet (eth2).
2011-07-16T00:53:00.000Z	aidan_follestad		When I use airmon-ng (which is part of the aircrack-ng suite) to list interfaces, it doesn't show any wifi interfaces (because it thinks the wifi interface is ethernet).
2011-07-16T00:53:00.000Z	aidan_follestad		Anyone have any ideas on how to fix this?
