2006-05-27T05:14:00.000Z	GatoLoko		I am thinking about helping with the Spanish translations of Ubuntu. Is there some guidelines about Rosetta or something similar that I must read before?
2006-05-27T05:15:00.000Z	KaiL	GatoLoko	too late for dapper - no new translations after the RC :/
2006-05-27T05:17:00.000Z	GatoLoko	KaiL	i'm not talking about dapper, but ubuntu in general, edgy and next
