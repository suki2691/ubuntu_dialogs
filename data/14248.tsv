2011-05-15T17:51:00.000Z	Silentmyst		 i can't get my laptop touch pad to disable... only have the option to turn it off while typing yet while typing it still moves and messes me up typing. i have even added a .rules file with a code i found that is supposed to shut it off while a external mouse is plugged in, but its still not shutting it off
