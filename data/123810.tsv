2008-11-07T05:00:00.000Z	cs_student		Ok, sorry I have to ask again.  How do I upgrade to 8.10 from 8.04 (I saw something about going o system-> software sources, but it got cut off do to all the disconnections)
2008-11-07T05:00:00.000Z	lavacano201014	cs_student	You mean from 8.04 to 8.10?
2008-11-07T05:01:00.000Z	lavacano201014	cs_student	No wait, I misread, that was right
2008-11-07T05:02:00.000Z	lavacano201014	cs_student	If you installed Fluxbox or something (I use AfterStep) you *could* do "sudo apt-get distupgrade", once all the updating is done
