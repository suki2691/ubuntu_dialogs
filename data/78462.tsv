2008-09-25T04:05:00.000Z	trimeta1	Gerinych	I had a triple-boot thing working here, and I had my OS X partition booting similarly to my Windows partition, yes.
2008-09-25T04:06:00.000Z	trimeta1	Gerinych	Yes.
2008-09-25T04:07:00.000Z	trimeta1	Gerinych	Ah. Hmm. If Grub can address the partition, that'd probably be your best bet...I don't know if it can, though.
