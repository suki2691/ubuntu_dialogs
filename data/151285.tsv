2007-02-18T12:11:00.000Z	adaptr	doofy2	is blender opengl-capable ?
2007-02-18T12:12:00.000Z	doofy2	adaptr	i truly do not know, im just having an issue when i mouse over stuff it seems to disappear, cant seem to do anything
2007-02-18T12:12:00.000Z	adaptr	doofy2	then blender probably does not support running its interface on opengl - beryl is *all* opengl...
