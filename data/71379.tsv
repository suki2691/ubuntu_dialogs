2008-12-14T09:58:00.000Z	RatPackSopra		I'm having some problems with ubuntu losing my dvd drive ...it lost it last night when I tried to play a movie (Totem) and when I put the system back on Vista it came back ...I understand there is a command line string that might help me, but I have no clue what to do. Can someone help me out?
