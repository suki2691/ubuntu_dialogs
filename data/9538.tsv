2011-09-17T00:45:00.000Z	Erevanic-Txa	Polah	well, I'm currently using Transmission, and I just have downloaded all 2pac's albums and half of the files came with this name "_____padding_file_22_if you see this file, please update to BitComet 0.85 or above__"
2011-09-17T00:46:00.000Z	Polah	Erevanic-Txa	try not to discuss illegal topics in here.
2011-09-17T00:47:00.000Z	Erevanic-Txa	Polah	it sounds to me just you have no answer of the question, because simply instead of 2pac song's it could be my work documents, so does that change anything? problem with still remain... just say you have no idea what to do I'm fine with that
