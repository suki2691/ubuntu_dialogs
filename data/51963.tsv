2010-05-20T02:42:00.000Z	jlebar		We've found a pretty serious memory leak in gnome-power-manager which we think has been tracked down to Ubuntu-specific code.  How can I get a Ubuntu dev to look at this?  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-power-manager/+bug/569273
2010-05-20T02:43:00.000Z	Slart	jlebar	if it's in the bug database that should be enough
2010-05-20T02:45:00.000Z	Slart	jlebar	from what I can see the bug is already getting some attention in the bug report
2010-05-20T02:46:00.000Z	jlebar	Slart	Oh...now that I look at it, you're right.  Chris Coulson has a canonical address.  This is good.
