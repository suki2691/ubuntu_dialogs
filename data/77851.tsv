2008-10-09T20:48:00.000Z	Tybear241083		anyone have any fancy commands like displayconfig-gtk but for sound cards? I am having trouble setting up 5.1 sound
2008-10-09T20:48:00.000Z	jim_p	Tybear241083	the command for sound in alsaconf, but the stupid developers do not provide it!!
2008-10-09T20:51:00.000Z	Tybear241083	jim_p	ok thanks, so I am assuming that that won't help me
2008-10-09T20:51:00.000Z	jim_p	Tybear241083	there is a thread in ubuntuforums for all sound related problems
