2012-01-25T19:06:00.000Z	insanekiller1		i'm trying to install the xf86-input-wacom-0.13.0 via the shell, but when i hit ./configure i get at the end that it needs xextproto to be >=  7.1.99 and that the version i have 7.1.2, but i installed x11proto-xext-dev 7.2.0-3 from the ubuntu software center... i'm using ubuntu 11.10
2012-01-25T19:07:00.000Z	iceroot	insanekiller1	why not using xserver-xorg-input-wacom?
2012-01-25T19:07:00.000Z	iceroot	insanekiller1	its the wacom driver
2012-01-25T19:08:00.000Z	insanekiller1	iceroot	actually i have it installed, but my wacom bamboo fun needs more drivers to run fine...
