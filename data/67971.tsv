2009-03-24T16:44:00.000Z	gartral	suku	generally, unless you have multiple sound cards, you should only run one at a time
2009-03-24T16:45:00.000Z	suku	gartral	interesting... then what is the point of even having pulse if alsa works?
2009-03-24T16:46:00.000Z	gartral	suku	compatibility, there are many things that dont work right, or well with pulse
