2011-01-19T05:45:00.000Z	Burzmali		Does anyone know how to find the DISPLAY name in Ubuntu?
2011-01-19T05:45:00.000Z	Burzmali		I need to run an xgamma from the terminal against the default display, and it needs the DISPLAY
2011-01-19T05:45:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Burzmali	echo $DISPLAY .. more than likely 0:0
2011-01-19T05:45:00.000Z	Burzmali	bastidrazor	actually ":0.0", we never like making it obvious in Linux do we ;)
