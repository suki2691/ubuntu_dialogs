2009-08-10T21:45:00.000Z	J11		Hi, I get 404 errors when using apt-get update from a (rather old) live cd
2009-08-10T21:46:00.000Z	J11		It's the live cd of Breezy
2009-08-10T21:47:00.000Z	legend2440	J11	breezy is long gone. no longer supported. those repos probably no longer exist
2009-08-10T21:54:00.000Z	legend2440	J11	gutsy is too old also. intrepid would work though
