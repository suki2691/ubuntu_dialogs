2012-09-24T20:40:00.000Z	Evdb		I have been trying to get Ubuntu on my MacBook Pro for about 15 hours total now. I think I managed to install Ubuntu. When I open Ubuntu in rEFIt, i get a pink window with grey options. I choose Ubuntu but the I get a Kernel panic (timer or something). I really hope there's an easy fix, I'm exhausted and getting a bit crazy too...

2012-09-24T20:43:00.000Z	designbybeck	Evdb	I've only done an install on a Mac once with ubuntu, The mac actually had XP on it too... but this is what worked for me: http://lifehacker.com/5934942/how-to-dual-boot-linux-on-your-mac-and-take-back-your-powerhouse-apple-hardware
