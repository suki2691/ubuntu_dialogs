2007-03-20T09:57:00.000Z	bitblit		no luck; so does ubuntu have sata drivers built in?
2007-03-20T09:59:00.000Z	Flannel	bitblit	does your BIOS see the SATA ones?
2007-03-20T09:59:00.000Z	bitblit	Flannel	yes; i am running xp on partition 1 of sata 1.
2007-03-20T10:00:00.000Z	bitblit	Flannel	and the bios does detect them on boot
