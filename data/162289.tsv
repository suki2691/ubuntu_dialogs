2007-05-24T14:44:00.000Z	mitchbones		I'm about to build my first computer, quick question. I plan to eventually overlock my intel c2d E6420 but not currently. I am waiting to get a Zalman in october-ish. But I already have a tube of artic silver. Should I just leave the cpu's thermal pad on there? or put the thermal paste on?
2007-05-24T14:44:00.000Z	mitchbones		How hard is it to remove the thermal paste when I put on a new heatsink?

2007-05-24T14:45:00.000Z	Svenstaro	mitchbones	get a cotton towel and clean the cpu
