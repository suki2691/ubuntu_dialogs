2011-01-19T07:42:00.000Z	schwinn434		I tried to boot my Ubuntu 10.1 machine today; wouldn't boot until I used the last kernel version of linux
2011-01-19T07:42:00.000Z	schwinn434		I don't know what this means - as far as repairing my distro goes
2011-01-19T07:42:00.000Z	schwinn434		any ideas helpful
2011-01-19T07:42:00.000Z	KM0201	schwinn434	well, 10.1 doesn't exist
