2006-06-01T05:47:00.000Z	Grunt		sorry for asking the same question that has been asked a million times but to upgrade from breezy to dapper.  Do you just need to type gksudo "update-manager -d"?
2006-06-01T05:49:00.000Z	Grunt		I have actually downloaded the live cd, is there an upgrade from that I can run?
2006-06-01T05:51:00.000Z	Grunt		sorry to be a pain but using the -d switch will upgrade it to the final version of Dapper, and not a rc?
2006-06-01T05:51:00.000Z	Sub	Grunt	yes it will.
