2012-08-23T04:50:00.000Z	notwo_away		hello I am about to install ubuntu, and I was wondering what are the difference between server and desctop edition. I am an old windows user but as I am using php for web application there no need for me to stay in windows any more. So I am realy into installing ubuntu and I need some advice in what is best for a php developer?
