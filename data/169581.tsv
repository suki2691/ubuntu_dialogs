2007-03-02T06:30:00.000Z	agliv5		Can anyone help me mount a local HD partition from a LiveCD?  I can't seem to figure out the correct args for mount...  Anyone happen to know or have a link to a guide?

2007-03-02T06:32:00.000Z	agliv5	tom47	I tried sudo mkdir /xyz but when I tried to mount the hd to /xyz it didn't work...
2007-03-02T06:33:00.000Z	agliv5	tom47	 it said that /xyz is not a block device...
