2007-04-28T09:19:00.000Z	dennister		hi ppl...am having some trouble with my new feisty installation: since ktorrent was crashing a lot even with feisty, i thought i'd give azureus another try...but i haven't even been able to configure it yet, and it wants to crash the second the configuration wizard shows itself...seems to be a problem with libglibjini, part of sun java 5, the jre...any ideas how to fix this people?
2007-04-28T09:20:00.000Z	dennister		i did install the sun java 6 properly already...java apps like speed tests on the web do work...it only started giving me problems since i started to configure azureus
2007-04-28T09:21:00.000Z	dennister		great...then i need wine...might as well use bitlord then
