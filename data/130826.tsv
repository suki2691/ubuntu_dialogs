2008-02-23T11:49:00.000Z	thinman1189		 I'm having some trouble with azureus. I opened it up and I got a message saying to download an update. Then when I went to reopen it gave me the option again, this time a window popped up in the corner saying it had shutdown wrong. Now whenever I open it it closes within 2 seconds of showing the main screen. The update seemed weird because it mentioned OSX but I wasn't sure. I'm using ubuntu gutsy.
