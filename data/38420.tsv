2010-04-04T17:52:00.000Z	Idlehead		is #gnome the right place to ask why the current gnome-shell does not work well with my lucid under virtual box?

2010-04-04T17:53:00.000Z	Idlehead	DasEi1	i don't know if it is a lucid issue. it could also be an issue of vbox or gnome-shell :D
2010-04-04T17:53:00.000Z	DasEi1	Idlehead	I've got some similar issues too, maybe see me there ?
