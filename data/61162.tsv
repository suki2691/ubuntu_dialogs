2009-04-01T02:01:00.000Z	jerryluc		i'm helping a friend out with his first experience with linux. I've never used ubuntu so i have some questions. is there a default repository that has "all" packages? if he has xubuntu installed, woun't amarok be in the repository because it isn't a kde environment?
2009-04-01T02:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jerryluc	why Xubuntu   instead of standard Ubuntu?   by the way if you want Ubuntu as well:  sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop   or install from the package manager
2009-04-01T02:03:00.000Z	jerryluc	sebsebseb	well it's my friends wish. i don't even use ubuntu,,,
2009-04-01T02:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jerryluc	you got Synaptic Package Manager in  Xubuntu?  if so that's a good start when it comes to installing stuff
