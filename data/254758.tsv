2005-01-16T10:34:00.000Z	method55		melzy: thanks, but i was going to partition the drive when i install winxp on the first partition, it has the option of partitioning the drive and formatting certain ones NTFS/FAT32 but i dont think i can format as a swap...if i leave the empty partition as just unallocated space will ubuntu ask me if i want to format it as swap?
2005-01-16T10:34:00.000Z	method55		in that case i will just let ubuntu make the partition because i think it defaults it at 512?
2005-01-16T10:35:00.000Z	method55		i have 512mb of RAM in this laptop...so another 512 swap would theoretically give me 1024mb which is more then enough for me
2005-01-16T10:36:00.000Z	the--dud	method55	the whole point of RAM is that it has 100th the access times of harddrives
