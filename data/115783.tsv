2008-01-27T02:21:00.000Z	emma		I would like to do a fresh install of ubuntu.  Is there a way to save everything in my home directory, and possibly, the preferences on some applications, so that I can easily transport them to the freshly installed ubuntu?
2008-01-27T02:22:00.000Z	emma		Okay so it's okay to burn a copy of my home folder to a CD and then do a fresh install and move the data into the new home folder?
2008-01-27T02:22:00.000Z	emma		Does that save preferences like firefox settings?
