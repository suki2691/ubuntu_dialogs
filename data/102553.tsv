2011-05-27T06:22:00.000Z	rww	JuJuBee	which protocol are you trying to use (ssh, ftp, etc.)?
2011-05-27T06:23:00.000Z	JuJuBee	rww	not sure, we have to use openvpn to map a network drive to get to our docs at work from home.
2011-05-27T06:24:00.000Z	rww	JuJuBee	ah. I was going to say that KDE lets you just put (e.g.) sftp://user@hostname/home/rww/whatever in file location bars, but I don't know anything about OpenVPN so I don't know if you can do that with those.
