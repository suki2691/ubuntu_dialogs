2008-12-25T06:35:00.000Z	nnx		I don't want to move up from 8.10 to 8.04, but 8.04 is insisting it needs a partial upgrade.

2008-12-25T06:36:00.000Z	nnx	nswfire	I just did two upgrades from 7.04 to 7.10, and 7.10 to 8.04.  If I go to 8.10, my rustic GeForce2 MX card won't have it's 3D acceleration anymore without a lot of kernel fiddling, so I understand it (and I don't have time for much of any these days).
