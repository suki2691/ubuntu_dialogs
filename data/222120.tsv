2008-08-04T09:31:00.000Z	Stormx2	sol1dus	you talking about a usb pen drive? GNOME automatically mounts them and you SHOULD have full r/w permissions if the driver allows it.
2008-08-04T09:33:00.000Z	Stormx2	sol1dus	unfortunately I don't know anything about xubuntu auto-mounts.
2008-08-04T09:34:00.000Z	Stormx2	sol1dus	try #xubuntu?
