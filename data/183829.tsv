2006-06-01T08:15:00.000Z	WimS		ok, i dist-upgraded to dapper from breezy and everything seemed like it worked, except my WiFi. It's broadcom. It used to work in breezy but it doesn't now. I couldn't get the new broadcom built in driver to work, so i rmmod it, but when i tried to install ndiswrapper and do it the way i did in breezy, but my network card doesn't wshow up in the network config dialog box, and not under ifconfig either
2006-06-01T08:17:00.000Z	WimS		so does anybody know how i get the built in broadcom driver to work ?
