2011-02-22T02:46:00.000Z	dissipate	sacarlson	i just tried the 'secure-delete' 'sfill' command.
2011-02-22T02:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	dissipate	did it work?  I did man and it's not installed on my system
2011-02-22T02:54:00.000Z	sacarlson	dissipate	but I see what sfill does now,  so your partition wasn't empty before you wanted to wipe it I guess.  this only wipes unused spaces bettween files that exist in a directory
