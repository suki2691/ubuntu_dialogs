2007-02-01T12:22:00.000Z	tovella	KennyR	yes, basicly - the music players already installed should play mp3 and WMA files, so long as you have installed the codecs for it.  I also installed some other players, though
2007-02-01T12:23:00.000Z	tovella	KennyR	basically, yes, and I agree with ad - mplayer is one of my favorites.
2007-02-01T12:26:00.000Z	tovella	KennyR	the thing to remember is that different players use different codecs, so I installed the w32codecs, as well as the gstreamer0-10-plugins, and libxine-extracodecs.
