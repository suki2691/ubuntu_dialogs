2009-09-09T12:53:00.000Z	biesbjerg		Hi, I setup a webserver on my ubuntu 8.04, NATted port 80 to the internal IP - but I'm not able to access the webserver by using the external IP? CanYouSeeMe.org confirms port 80 is open and natted to the correct internal IP - so what have I missed?
2009-09-09T12:53:00.000Z	herenbdy	biesbjerg	most ISPs block port 80
2009-09-09T12:53:00.000Z	herenbdy	biesbjerg	even though I specifically forwad port 80 on my router, I cannot access port 80 externally
