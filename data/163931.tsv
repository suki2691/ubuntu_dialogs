2006-12-19T10:14:00.000Z	leobloom		hallo again, I have another problem actualy it's not really a problem just a curiosity, Ihave installed the ekiga and when I opened it I've seen i don't really want it (it's useless tome) but whenI closed it it asked me to send the bug report, now I'd like to unistall it, can i do it without any risk or should i better leave it there? can it depend on the huge amount of updates I've made today (more than 60 mb...)?

2006-12-19T10:28:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	leobloom	shouldnt be, no. but imho its better to know what you are doing instead or running scripts you dont understand
2006-12-19T10:30:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	leobloom	thats why we have the capability to learn :) learn what it is you need and install it, instead of letting a script do it for you
