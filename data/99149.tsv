2008-03-03T06:49:00.000Z	flowOver	jtravnick	what is more official than the instructions offered inside the installer?
2008-03-03T06:50:00.000Z	flowOver		or perhaps even the installation instructions on their website
2008-03-03T06:51:00.000Z	jtravnick	flowOver	would have been nice if somewhere it had told me that it had that im sitting here going through the web site trying to get this to do a dual boot install
