2008-04-02T19:15:00.000Z	Vixen_		Can anyone tell me the major reasons why I should use 7.10 instead of 6.10? I've just managed to install 6.10, it's me first ever linux install.
2008-04-02T19:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Vixen_	7.10 is later and improved
2008-04-02T19:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Vixen_	7.10 has longer support left
2008-04-02T19:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Vixen_	well there is things your missing, such as compiz as an easy example, but thats up to you if you want it or not
