2007-05-11T16:23:00.000Z	Evildobbi		Hey I have a mouse problem. I have tried 2 different mice but same result. If I press left and right mouse button at same time it will do something like as if I did a middle scroll button press. Anyone seen this before & or know how to fix it?

2007-05-11T16:26:00.000Z	nickrud	Evildobbi	any particular reason you want to turn it off?
2007-05-11T16:26:00.000Z	nickrud	Evildobbi	just so you know, that's a holdover when almost no one had three button mice
