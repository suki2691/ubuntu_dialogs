2011-09-11T21:16:00.000Z	fruitbag		Guys, I want to execute a shell script and need authentication, but don't know what password sudo expects. I've tried the password that I've set and it fails to authenticate.
2011-09-11T21:17:00.000Z	fruitbag		You must excuse my ignorance, guys. Is this the password I use to log in?
2011-09-11T21:18:00.000Z	t0ken	fruitbag	yes
