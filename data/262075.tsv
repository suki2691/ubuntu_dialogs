2006-07-20T11:45:00.000Z	gean		i'm just upgrading from breezy 5.10 to 6.epsilon, things went wrong, after some long download, x11-common was not installed because of ubuntu-minimal conflict (i had some x-common), the kernel seems to be installed... think i have to reboot and come back... Any echo about Ubuntu6.02 ?
