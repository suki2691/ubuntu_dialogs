2010-05-30T00:56:00.000Z	Docteh	frxstrem	probably, what does the man page say?
2010-05-30T00:57:00.000Z	Docteh	frxstrem	woah thats hard to understand, i see why you're asking here
2010-05-30T00:58:00.000Z	frxstrem	Docteh	by the way, I believe the manual page for the sudoers file is not 'man sudo', but 'man sudoers'
