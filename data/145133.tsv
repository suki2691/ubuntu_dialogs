2007-03-17T10:14:00.000Z	compilerwriter		Yes they some people still do own the damned things.
2007-03-17T10:14:00.000Z	Alonea	compilerwriter	hmm, you got any friends with floppy drives?
2007-03-17T10:17:00.000Z	Alonea	compilerwriter	well, if you really need that file I would try asking them to get it off for you. I honestly dont know how to get linux to see it. Have you tried describing your problem in ##linux? they got my MMC reader working.
