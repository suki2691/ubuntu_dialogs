2005-12-03T15:12:00.000Z	Helene		I'd like to know how to record an audio stream (radio broadcast) , live or time-shifted
2005-12-03T15:13:00.000Z	smo	Helene	it's far from point'n'click, but mplayer has a -dumpstream function that can be very handy
2005-12-03T15:14:00.000Z	Helene	smo	tx. I just found out about streamtuner - will try it
