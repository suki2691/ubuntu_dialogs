2006-04-14T06:11:00.000Z	ScreaminIke		hey. how do i set up a proxy server so that only certain websites can be accessed? i could run it locally.... but i want one of my users to be limited in the sites he accesses. ideally, everything would be blocked by default, and i could manually unblock shit....
