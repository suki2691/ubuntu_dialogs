2009-03-21T11:39:00.000Z	dparker		Hi - say I'm wondering if someone might just have the answer for me on this: my last distribution upgrade (to 8.04) went great, but subsequent to that I've not been shown the availability of distribution upgrades.  It seems I got switched to the "LTS" plan somehow.  This was not my intention, and it's really not what I want. Any idea what I need to tweak to fix this?
