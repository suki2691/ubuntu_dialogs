2012-04-21T03:53:00.000Z	nursedad	smrtz	why duel boot with backtrack im just wondering
2012-04-21T03:54:00.000Z	smrtz	nursedad	actually, I normally run arch linux, but needed a debian base for school, so I figured I'd try backtrack because it can do everything ubuntu can, but comes with more hacking programs, and those might be fun to mess with when I'm in class...
2012-04-21T03:56:00.000Z	smrtz	nursedad	yeah, ubuntu's great for new users and pros, but I feel like the extra tools could be fun.
