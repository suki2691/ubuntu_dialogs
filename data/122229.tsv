2007-09-12T08:21:00.000Z	Helzibah	davidosa	shut your computer down, insert CD, start computer and pay attention to boot-up screens, there should be a button to press to get to "setup" or "bios" settings
2007-09-12T08:22:00.000Z	Helzibah	davidosa	then it sholud be obvious hov to change your comp to boot from CD
