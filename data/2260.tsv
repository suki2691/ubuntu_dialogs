2012-06-25T22:34:00.000Z	FriedPet	glitsj16	in the grub menu I pressed 'e' and replaced "quiet splash" with "nomodeset". I have not made any changes to any files yet. Can't get into Ubuntu. But now I'm baffled - I just rebooted my system and it works. I didn't even do anything! Why would Ubuntu sometimes not work and other times do!?
