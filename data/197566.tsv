2007-03-26T10:23:00.000Z	NickGarvey	sid	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2007-03-26T10:23:00.000Z	sid	NickGarvey	But apt-get isn't as good as aptitude I've seen debian developers say. NickGarvey also.. there are policy changes that update-manager handles... does apt-get do that also?
2007-03-26T10:24:00.000Z	NickGarvey	sid	can't say I use aptitude much.. (or ubuntu for that matter hah)
