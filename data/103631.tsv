2009-11-29T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chatZilla	i still check them with md5 but the torrent protocol checks the data once all the data is downloaded
2009-11-29T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chatZilla	i'd still md5 though
2009-11-29T01:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chatZilla	torrent the data as normal, once the file is completed, md5 test the iso file as normal
