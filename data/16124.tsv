2011-04-18T12:59:00.000Z	mithran	^NiNjA	 i am trying to create a user, so that when i try to do an administrative task, it will prompt me for my password...root will not prompt right? kazagistar: after making the user, how can i use visudo to give the user sudo privileges?
2011-04-18T13:02:00.000Z	^NiNjA	mithran	 im not sure if i can help you here. the password prompt is a security feature to ensure only ssomeone with root or allowed privelages can make system changes
