2008-05-04T06:51:00.000Z	andi5	laeg	/bin/azureus/azureus looks like a broken path... are you sure it is not /usr/bin/azureus?
2008-05-04T06:55:00.000Z	laeg	andi5	/bin/azureus/azureus exists but i've also tried to use the script which is in /use/bin/azureus - both give the same result unforuntately :(
