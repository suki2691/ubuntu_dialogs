2011-03-07T03:04:00.000Z	aroman		why did my package that builds perfectly on lucid, fail to build when I changed it to maverick in debian/control? http://launchpadlibrarian.net/65759906/buildlog_ubuntu-maverick-i386.elementary-wallpapers_0.2.1_FAILEDTOBUILD.txt.gz
2011-03-07T03:06:00.000Z	aroman		multipass_: yes, and what does that mean?
2011-03-07T03:07:00.000Z	Muelli	aroman	dunno exactly. But you can try to reproduce. Or be more verbose during build.
2011-03-07T03:08:00.000Z	aroman	Muelli	how would I do that?
