2009-01-23T23:30:00.000Z	CyL		Anyone would please help me getting my keyboard working correctly with ubuntu, since I can't get it to work correctly after trying almost anything I could think of...
2009-01-23T23:31:00.000Z	oipat	CyL	That wasn't very descriptive. In what way is it not working correctly?
2009-01-23T23:33:00.000Z	CyL	oipat	Sorry... the problem is that some key combinations don't get the expected output (form example, typing acute+c should give me a cedilla, but instead gives me a Ä‡)....
2009-01-23T23:38:00.000Z	CyL	oipat	any clue what should be causing this issue?
