2008-08-13T22:39:00.000Z	Grey_Loki		Hi there :) Does anyone know of a (I guess a CAD) program where I can feed in the schematic for an electronic circuit and a protoboard type, and it will spit out the most space-efficient layout?
2008-08-13T22:39:00.000Z	ennonymous	Grey_Loki	not sure, but can Eagle do that?
2008-08-13T22:40:00.000Z	ennonymous		Otherwise OrCAD can do it, but that's expensive
2008-08-13T22:40:00.000Z	Grey_Loki	ennonymous	I don't know - i'll check that out right now though; thanks :)
