2010-05-30T04:21:00.000Z	NewWorld	azolap	 I remember successfully running Ubuntu LiveCD on a machine with no  HDD
2010-05-30T04:22:00.000Z	azolap	NewWorld	.. on the ubuntu installation disk i am choosing "Run ubuntu with no changes to your computer" .. is this the correct option for livecd ?
2010-05-30T04:23:00.000Z	NewWorld	azolap	 Yeh, that sounds right
