2009-10-06T14:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	davidguard	boot to livecd to use better fsck options
2009-10-06T14:08:00.000Z	davidguard	ActionParsnip	so we have the livecd running. What fsck options should we use... I've never used it before.
2009-10-06T14:10:00.000Z	davidguard	ActionParsnip	funny thing is that the restricted drivers are available from the livecd. But in the installed version there are no drivers in the list.
