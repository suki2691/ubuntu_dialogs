2005-07-06T13:48:00.000Z	Ghete1		I have an ethical question. I just crashed my car and I have had to cancel a semester of college b/c i havent the means to get there or the money to fix my car. someone close to me has offered me a pretty good amount of money to set up a kolab server and a few clients. i have always recieved help free of charge here at the ubuntu and kubuntu channels. should i take this job?
