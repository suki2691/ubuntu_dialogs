2010-09-17T13:58:00.000Z	vaibhav1		I have installed Ubuntu 10.04 and now I wanted to install ubuntu 8.10 as dual boot.. Does it will install normally or do I have to make chages in grub??

2010-09-17T14:05:00.000Z	maedox	vaibhav1	It might actually work, but I honestly didn't try exactly what you want so I can't say for sure. As long as you don't mess with the partition table and 10.04 data you can always reinstall grub if it gets screwed up.
