2008-04-01T19:23:00.000Z	mjanisz		hi! id' like to install ubuntu in a few days, however with upcoming release of 8.04 i'd like to ask if it's better to install 7.10 and dist-updgrade or do the same bur with 8.04b ?
2008-04-01T19:23:00.000Z	jrib	mjanisz	depends on whether you want a stable system or not
2008-04-01T19:24:00.000Z	mjanisz	jrib	how unstable is 8.04b? i can wait 25 days as long as i have my system up and running. not quite production system, but for casual use
2008-04-01T19:26:00.000Z	jrib	mjanisz	if you're asking whether you should install it or not, I'd recommend 7.10
