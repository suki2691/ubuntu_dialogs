2007-02-08T17:19:00.000Z	osfameron		I found a lot of the media players crashed with stupid error messages while trying to import my music collection (like amarok, which additionally has a really confusing user interface)
2007-02-08T17:19:00.000Z	osfameron	mneptok	oh?  I've not had problems, but yeah, that could be annoying
2007-02-08T17:20:00.000Z	mneptok	osfameron	depends on gstreamer-mad. BAD packager! no cookie!
