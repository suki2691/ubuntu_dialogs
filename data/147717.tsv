2007-04-22T05:51:00.000Z	riccardo		i'm having a problem trying to install the new 8.36 ati drivers: there are guides on the net that say that you just need to enable restricted repos and then you can install the frglx package... but my frglx package is still at 8.34.5, apt says it doesn't need to be updated
2007-04-22T05:52:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	riccardo	thats the newest in the repositories then.
2007-04-22T05:54:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	riccardo	are you running edgy or feisty?
2007-04-22T05:55:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	riccardo	what is the exact package name you're trying to install?
