2010-07-25T13:36:00.000Z	Cheery		hi. could you propose a small webserver that I could use simply by starting it in directory where I've got the contents I want to put up?
2010-07-25T13:36:00.000Z	Cheery		there's no other http servers on my system
2010-07-25T13:37:00.000Z	Cheery		also, could someone FINALLY update the chromium-browser to newest version from that old version 5?
