2008-01-17T08:20:00.000Z	Djerkaf	Jay-Oh-En	At the installation of Ubuntu server, it can't identify the format of the disk, and freezes.
2008-01-17T08:20:00.000Z	Jay-Oh-En	Djerkaf	did you run a memtest on the disk and a cd check?
2008-01-17T08:21:00.000Z	Djerkaf	Jay-Oh-En	I have tried running it with several different RAM sticks, an I doubt everyone would not work. And I have run a CD check, yes.
