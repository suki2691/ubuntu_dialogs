2008-07-26T02:53:00.000Z	ttwaro		Bear with me, I've never use IRC before. Let me know if I should be somewhere else. I was sent here from an ubuntu forum. I have an HP laptop (dv6258se) that I have installed 8.04 on. I'm using the gnome desktop which is new to me but I like very much. Anyway, my immediate problem is a blank screen after my computer is idle for an extended period of time. I responds to caps-lock, etc but won't display anything. I have to ctrl-alt-backspace to get out of it
