2008-12-04T21:20:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	and-ri	in nautilus, go to edit --> preferences --> removable media... and uncheck the browse media when plugged check box.
2008-12-04T21:27:00.000Z	and-ri	Odd-rationale	 thx, but my nautilus doesn't have such a entry. I solve it by using : settings->control Center->Peripherals->StorageMedia, chose Mounted Removable Medium and set 'do nothing' as AUTOACTION
2008-12-04T21:28:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	and-ri	ok. i think the actual path was Edit --> preference --> media --> browse meia when inserted...
