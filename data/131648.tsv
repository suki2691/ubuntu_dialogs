2007-12-31T09:00:00.000Z	eldustino		Hello, I'm trying to get an app installed which is not available via apt repos.  During 'make', I get the following message:  "error: openssl/ssl.h: No such file or directory".  Same messages for err.h, & md5.h as well.  OpenSSL version 0.9.8e-5ubuntu3.1 is installed, but I indeed cannot find ssl.h.  Thoughts?
