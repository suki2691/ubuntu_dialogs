2006-04-01T11:40:00.000Z	ian_	TheFaction20	Amen.  Still not sure if I'm running the right Dist for me though.
2006-04-01T11:40:00.000Z	ian_	TheFaction20	I'm curious about the others, but why mess with a good thing.
2006-04-01T11:43:00.000Z	ian_	TheFaction20	Me too.  Gonna go get some books, some cd's...play around.  Also have access to lots of hard-drives, so I might multi-boot.
