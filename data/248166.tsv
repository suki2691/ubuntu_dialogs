2007-10-19T02:36:00.000Z	speaker219_		I have a question again guys. Is Ubuntu 7.10 out yet?
2007-10-19T02:36:00.000Z	speaker219_		I heard it's technically done and out of beta, just not "released"
2007-10-19T02:36:00.000Z	ompaul	speaker219_	ehh that is what released means
2007-10-19T02:48:00.000Z	ompaul	speaker219_	please stay calm ;-)
