2009-08-29T02:06:00.000Z	ChaoticXSinZ		Can anyone hellp me with a problem I'm experiencing?
2009-08-29T02:07:00.000Z	ChaoticXSinZ		I don't know why but I am unable to set my brigthness level on my laptop. A quick look at dmesg shows: "[ 7703.962873] ACPI: Failed to switch the brightness". I'm running Ubuntu 9.04 my kernel is "2.6.30-020630-generic"
2009-08-29T02:08:00.000Z	ChaoticXSinZ		I tried setting brightness using fn buttons. It worked as recently as this morning.
2009-08-29T02:09:00.000Z	Out_Cold	ChaoticXSinZ	did you update this morning??
