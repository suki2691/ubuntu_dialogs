2011-10-14T21:16:00.000Z	reisio	jeroth	doesn't need to be, you can install gnome-shell and gnome-panel
2011-12-02T07:52:00.000Z	reisio	jeroth	somewhere around the same pref area I would think
2011-12-02T07:53:00.000Z	jeroth	reisio	Power options under system settings only has two options. Suspend and Hibernate. Which are both off. I cant find the option for monitors?
