2011-11-19T23:41:00.000Z	DanS326_home		I consistantly run into issues while using a live USB where it insists on looking for the CD in the drive instead of the USB stick ... any info on fixing this or a better work around than simply telling it that the cd is not a repository so it downloads everything
2011-11-19T23:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DanS326_home	did you MD5 test the ISO you transfered?
2011-11-19T23:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Markc: it will use the opensource driver but should run well
2011-11-19T23:47:00.000Z	DanS326_home	ActionParsnip	can you give me a link to the md5 listing
