2011-02-07T03:32:00.000Z	jrib	Kazilla	I just set it up on my router and then have my computers use the router for dns.  Are you using an ubuntu box as a router?
2011-02-07T03:36:00.000Z	jrib	Kazilla	http://askubuntu.com/questions/20313/name-resolution-on-home-lan has some hints.  You can probably scour the docs for whatever dns server you use and get more info too
