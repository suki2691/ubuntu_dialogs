2007-04-20T06:22:00.000Z	iamelite		So anyways, i asked before and if someone answered me, i apologize for not being able to keep up with fast scrolls on my PDA. I installed xorg-fglrx on my PC with FF 7.04 and when i initialized a hot bootstrap operation, My GUI was incapable of accuratly displaying color, shape or even pixilation of any kind. The image was black and void of form.
