2007-10-30T09:14:00.000Z	Thanatos		Do you guys know why I get this error message when I try to save onto my external HD? 'You are trying to save the file on a read-only disk. Please check that you typed the location correctly and try again.' (I am on Feisty, and already have ntfs-3g) Essentially, I'm asking: How do I turn off read-only for my external HD?
