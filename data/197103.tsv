2008-08-30T20:25:00.000Z	bobertdos	Dante123	Yeah, Xubuntu
2008-08-30T20:27:00.000Z	bobertdos	Dante123	Eh, it would run okay, not brilliantly, but better than it would under Gnome or KDE. I don't want to go off-topic, but there are lots of other minimalistic distros you could try too.
2008-08-30T20:29:00.000Z	bobertdos	Dante123	I like Puppy Linux. It initially runs off CD, but you can configure it to run a session from a single file, so that's kind of cool.
