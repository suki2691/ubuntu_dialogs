2009-09-06T21:34:00.000Z	DeepFrz		I have ubuntu live and am trying to copy some photo files from a windows drive (borked by malware) to an old linux hd but I keep running into permission problems. Can someone help?
2009-09-06T21:35:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ	DeepFrz	did you sudo mount the drive?
2009-09-06T21:36:00.000Z	DeepFrz	TheVenerableZ	thevdi I can see the files, and I have cleaned off my old user partition, but don't know how to get files to the old partition
2009-09-06T21:37:00.000Z	DeepFrz	TheVenerableZ	no I didn't mount the drive, it just showed up on booting up ubuntu live
