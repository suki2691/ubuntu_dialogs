2006-07-31T13:24:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	ajmitch	you think you could dig up an example for me?

2006-07-31T13:40:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	ajmitch	yeah, I know that.. but if I pick the ID of the first card and try to NAME=dsp , everything breaks.. how do I tell the kernel I want to point /dev/dsp AND /dev/audio AND /dev/mixer to that card? when I look up any of those devices now all the numbers are the same.
