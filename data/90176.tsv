2010-02-06T04:00:00.000Z	domino14		i'd like to install ubuntu on a windows XP laptop (full install, not within windows) and i have already defragged the hard drive. i am unclear as to what the community website says. do i have to use GParted now to resize the windows partition, or can i just install ubuntu directly using the "largest contiguous space" option?
2010-02-06T04:01:00.000Z	terminhell	domino14	select the "user entire disk" option for a full dedicated install
2010-02-06T04:03:00.000Z	domino14	terminhell	no i want to dual-boot
2010-02-06T04:04:00.000Z	terminhell	domino14	i wouldnt use the largest continous space. it will leave no room left for windows. Instead move the slider accordingly. It give atleast 10gigs for ubuntu.
