2011-11-24T01:05:00.000Z	rodhash		Hello guys.. I just issued 'do-release-upgrade' it it upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04... should I run it again to upgrade to 11.10 or should I first reboot my laptop?

2011-11-24T01:07:00.000Z	geoffmcc	rodhash	first run the update manager and get any updates and then do the release upgrade
2011-11-24T01:08:00.000Z	geoffmcc	rodhash	go ahead and do it just to be sure
