2007-10-05T16:05:00.000Z	Meroigo		.... 3D acceleration on my ATI Radeon 8500LE card just stopped working after I had configured X to use two monitors. The monitor things works great, but now my 3D doesn't work.. =/ anyone know what to do?

2007-10-05T16:07:00.000Z	Meroigo	nickren	what are you talking about now? :) My extended desktop works as I want it to. But now 3D doesn't work. X crashes when I run google earth, glxgears runs really slow etc...
