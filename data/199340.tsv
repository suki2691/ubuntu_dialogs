2006-02-20T12:47:00.000Z	Mordof	virogenesis	thats why you dont deal with some companies even if they have good prices, you have to find places that will help you out
2006-02-20T12:48:00.000Z	Mordof	virogenesis	which is exactly why i pay a guy more money to get PC's and parts from him then i would even at some stores that sell for higher prices.. but the difference is he will go out of his way to help me when i have a problem
