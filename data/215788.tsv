2007-02-28T17:59:00.000Z	Ryanmt		hey guys, does anybody know of a page about the recovery mode of ubuntu? Im trying to rewrite /etc/passwd but its overwriting it each time
2007-02-28T17:59:00.000Z	soundray	Ryanmt	are you sure the recovery mode uses the same root partition
2007-02-28T06:05:00.000Z	soundray	Ryanmt	you haven't answered my question above
2007-02-28T06:05:00.000Z	soundray	Ryanmt	are you ignoring me?
