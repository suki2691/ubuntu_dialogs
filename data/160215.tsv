2010-08-20T05:16:00.000Z	Felix00		hi. im using eclipse 3.5 for linux. im trying to install RIM Blackberry API, a popup window is expected to prompt for user and password but instead of that a error says "Unable to read repository at https://www.blackberry.com/Downloads/auth/contactFormPreload.do?code=DC727151E5D55DDE1E950767CF861CA5&dl=C9731C89FBE87985618D78406AE1A89B". It cannot retrieve because it needs authentication. PLEASE help
