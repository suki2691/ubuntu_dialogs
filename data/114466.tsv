2008-02-29T04:33:00.000Z	prodigel		Hi all. I want to setup a wireless network, and probably I'm very close to do it, but I don't have the certainty. Currently I'm connected to the wireless access point by cable, also by wireless, on cable I got an IP(I'm chatting here by wire) but by wireless I don't get any response on dhclient. How do I check if I'm really connected to the wireless network, and if so how do I get an IP from it?
