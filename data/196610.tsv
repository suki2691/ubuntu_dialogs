2006-03-22T12:34:00.000Z	Johannesen		Hi, I have tried to get Airport Extreme on my Powerbook to function... but, as I can see there is no need for a bcm43xx driver, as it is in the kernel - is that correct?

2006-03-22T12:36:00.000Z	Johannesen	chuckyp	but I can do modprope bcm43xx
2006-03-22T12:37:00.000Z	chuckyp	Johannesen	hrm... dunno maybe i'm thinking of a difference broadcomm chipset.
