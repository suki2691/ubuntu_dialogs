2010-06-07T02:45:00.000Z	wessel		I'm having trouble using the sliders and buttons on flash video's on youtube, is this a common problem?
2010-06-07T02:45:00.000Z	MrPagh	wessel	yes....its a problem with the 64-bit version
2010-06-07T02:47:00.000Z	MrPagh	wessel	the Adobe-Flashplugin which Ubuntu installs is a 32-bit version ...with a "wrapper" around it ...the wrapper conflicts with compiz.
2010-06-07T02:47:00.000Z	MrPagh	wessel	in effect ...if you temporarily disable compiz (Set Visual Effects to 'None') ...the Flash plugin works fine.
