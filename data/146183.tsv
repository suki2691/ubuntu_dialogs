2007-02-10T17:42:00.000Z	repp		hi, i'm trying to install Edgy, but i get a Buffer I/O Error from the cdrom during the installation. This is a bug fixed in newer 2.6.19/20 kernels, so what i have to do to install Edgy? are there nightly builds?

2007-02-10T17:44:00.000Z	repp	Flannel	yep checked with md5sum... are there Feisty builds available?
2007-02-10T17:45:00.000Z	Flannel	repp	yeah, Herd3 is out (still Alpha though).  #ubuntu+1 has all the info.
