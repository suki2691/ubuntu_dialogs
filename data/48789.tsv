2010-05-11T00:39:00.000Z	rizzuh		How do I install gnome-app-installer in Lucid? It's not in the repos anymore :(
2010-05-11T00:41:00.000Z	rizzuh		The one that used to be before it was replaced by software center in 9.10.
2010-05-11T00:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	rizzuh	don't know why you'd want to but perhaps http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1466292 will help.  Good luck, guess there is a PPA that includes it.
