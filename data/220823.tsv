2005-09-11T12:28:00.000Z	clarknova		Can someone tell me how to fix a kernel panic on boot? "<0>Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!" I had to force a shutdown and this was the result. Do i have to reinstall?

2005-09-11T12:32:00.000Z	clarknova	Blissex	can you reccomend a course of action?
2005-09-11T12:32:00.000Z	Blissex	clarknova	bugs.kernel.org and there is a nice HOWTO on how to report kernel bugs.
