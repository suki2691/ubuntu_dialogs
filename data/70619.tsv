2008-12-26T08:11:00.000Z	Tenkawa		Anyone else noticed something in 8.10 synaptics where if you try to do a quick search on say mysql it comes up with nothing although you can scroll through the list and find plenty of mysql packages in the main list
2008-12-26T08:12:00.000Z	Tenkawa		am I mising something with spm's search syntax?
2008-12-26T08:12:00.000Z	thirtyechos	Tenkawa	its that the other packages have mysql in the discription
2008-12-26T08:12:00.000Z	Tenkawa	thirtyechos	yeah but it comes up with none in a quick search at all
