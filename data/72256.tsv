2009-09-07T23:22:00.000Z	darthlukan	jon5000	i have prop ati drivers on my desktop. but i lost sound in jaunty over hdmi
2009-09-07T23:22:00.000Z	jon5000		nVidia has not been a prob.  but ATI's lack of support for linux combined with thier unwillingness to let the community in on thier pror drivers has prevented me from upgrading
2009-09-07T23:22:00.000Z	jon5000	darthlukan	what video card do you use?
