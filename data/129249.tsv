2007-07-08T10:17:00.000Z	Stwange		my mate installed XP onto a new partition of a vista computer, but then it would only boot into XP, so then he deleted the XP partition and it won't boot at all because the bootloader needs repairing. Is there any way to do this with a ubuntu live CD? (he doesn't have the vista dvd)

2007-07-08T10:19:00.000Z	Stwange	Anlar	he doesn't want ubuntu on the computer, I'm just wondering if I can use ubuntu (preferrably live CD) to repair the bootloader to get vista booting.
