2009-01-06T08:19:00.000Z	rymetyme		ok I have looked at about 10 forums and about 30 threads but I can't seem to find an answer about seperate x screens on nvidia version 173 x server
2009-01-06T08:20:00.000Z	the_squircle	rymetyme	just plug in the external monitor, go to the NVIDIA settings, click "detect displays" and you'll be good to go.
2009-01-06T08:23:00.000Z	the_squircle	rymetyme	i don't know how to troubleshoot that beyond this point... try getting someone else to help. sorry!
2009-01-06T08:29:00.000Z	the_squircle	rymetyme	if you can't get an answer here, you can almost definately get an answer on the forums... there are tons of smart people there.
