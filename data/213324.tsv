2006-03-27T12:39:00.000Z	_jason	HedgeMage	yes I did it once... it involved an about:config like thing in thunderbird.  I found it on the mozilla forums somewhere
2006-03-27T12:40:00.000Z	HedgeMage	_jason	thanks, I tried searching their help and such, I should have thought to try the forums
2006-03-27T12:40:00.000Z	_jason	HedgeMage	for some reason I have this bookmark: http://www.mozilla.org/support/thunderbird/tips#beh_downloadstartup , but I do recall having to read something in the forums
