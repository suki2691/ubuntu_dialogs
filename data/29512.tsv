2010-07-03T13:00:00.000Z	Meekro		So I installed the Intel i7 980X CPU (3.33 gHz, 6 cores with hyperthreading) on my server, but /proc/cpuinfo is reporting each of 12 cores at only 1600mHz. That doesn't seem right
2010-07-03T13:02:00.000Z	Loshki	Meekro	isn't there some kind of benchmark you can run?
2010-07-03T13:03:00.000Z	Meekro	Loshki	if you know of a good CPU benchmarking tool, I'd love to give it a shot
2010-07-03T13:04:00.000Z	Loshki	Meekro	I see a bunch of hits when I google "ubuntu cpu benchmark". Poke around those a bit...
