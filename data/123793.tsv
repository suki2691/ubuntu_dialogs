2007-09-01T16:35:00.000Z	NMajik		Can anyone recommend a command to be run to mute all audio outputs regardless of card?
2007-09-01T16:35:00.000Z	rexy_	NMajik	amixer might do that
2007-09-01T16:36:00.000Z	rexy_	NMajik	might not be able too, script something that cycles through every control, just muting the master out/mic is probably enough though?
2007-09-01T16:37:00.000Z	rexy_	NMajik	probably muted the wrong thing
