2009-06-24T02:31:00.000Z	Conexion		Ugg Ubuntu is wearing me out. It keeps loading in text mode: I've tried startx, dpkg-reconfigure all, reinstalling nvidia drivers, nothing is 'failing' but startx can't find any screens, I reinstalled ubuntu and it worked until about the 3rd time I restarted it, I've tried repair mode and searching online and can't find anything. Any ideas?
