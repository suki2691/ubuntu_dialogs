2008-07-10T03:12:00.000Z	Akeru_Forsamee		In a nutshell, I installed TF2 in Wine and it won't run because it says my hardware doesn't support at least Pixel Shader 1.1. I looked up my GFX card specs and it supports Pixel Shader 1.4. Is this a drivers problem? A wine bug? I'm running 8.04. More info Here: http://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?t=1644
