2008-06-04T10:37:00.000Z	BurnedPhoenix		I am running 8.04 with an Nvidia 8600GS Graphics Card. I want to upgrade the video driver. Do the Restricted Drivers update on there own or is there a automated process that will allow me to install the newest June 1st Drivers while maintaining my Current Video settings?
