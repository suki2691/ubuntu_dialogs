2010-04-07T08:35:00.000Z	albertolempira	chelz	i did that, but sometimes i get help on #ubuntu faster than in the kubuntu channel
2010-04-07T08:35:00.000Z	chelz	albertolempira	that probably would work best with stuff installed in both ubuntu and kubuntu. plasma is not installed by default in ubuntu though.
