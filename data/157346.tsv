2007-03-10T08:40:00.000Z	Huffalump		So, since we can't figure out why audio doesnt work for this user... and I'm forced to create a new user and abandon this one.... what's the command I need to copy files from one to the other.... something like   sudo cp /home/myuser /home/mynewuserwithaudio  ?
2007-03-10T08:41:00.000Z	Huffalump		I meant    sudo cp /home/myuser/* /home/mynewuserwithaudio  ?
