2010-11-27T00:02:00.000Z	jags		hey I'm trying to change some notification icons, i have replacements but they're actually in .png format, all the howtos I've read involve .svg's
2010-11-27T00:02:00.000Z	jags		anyone know how to change notification area icons, I know they're stored in /usr/share/icons, but not sure how to go about replacing them

2010-11-27T00:04:00.000Z	Padster	jags	and inkscape has a built-in tracer, too
