2005-05-01T12:05:00.000Z	de_DustyCiti		Hi~ I'm currently running Ubuntu Live and have install CD img on hd. Could someone point me a way to install ubuntu from these things I have?
2005-05-01T12:07:00.000Z	de_DustyCiti		Thanks guys but the problem is that I don't have a cd recorder.
2005-05-01T12:07:00.000Z	de_DustyCiti		Is it possible to install from hd (like I did with FC3)?
