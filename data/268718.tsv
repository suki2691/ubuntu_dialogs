2005-07-29T15:39:00.000Z	Chalma|ZzZ		I don't want to be flamed but I am incredibly new to linux and I just installed ubuntu but I can't get a graphic screen.  I tried xf86free and start x but none of those commands work

2005-07-29T15:40:00.000Z	bob2	Chalma|ZzZ	why would you be flamed?
2005-07-29T15:40:00.000Z	bob2	Chalma|ZzZ	you did a default install and X didn't start at all?
