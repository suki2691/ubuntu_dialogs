2006-04-18T16:05:00.000Z	Twisted2253		Could anyone help me figure out how to play mp3's? When I opened up AmaroK it told me the GST sound engine could not play mp3s, so after browsing the forums I Installed the Xine sound engine.. however, when I try to change the sound sysyem in AmaroK the Xine engine is not listed.
