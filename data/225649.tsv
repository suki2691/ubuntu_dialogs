2008-02-13T00:41:00.000Z	_Oz_		what does everyone use to burn DVD-R movies in ubuntu?
2008-02-13T00:41:00.000Z	_Oz_		I use DeVeDe and gnomebaker and the result was movies that were choppy and had bad sound
2008-02-13T00:41:00.000Z	_Oz_		is there something more reliable?
2008-02-13T00:41:00.000Z	puff	_Oz_	I haven't burned a movie with it, but so far I've been happiest with Brasero.
