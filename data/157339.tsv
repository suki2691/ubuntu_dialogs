2007-08-09T10:35:00.000Z	linux_kid		AVG has found 32 instances of a Win32/Polycrypt virus on the L:\ (Ubuntu) drive of my pc.  It is in normal places like L:\usr\bin\gnome-system-moniter, ect.  Is this something I should be worried about??

2007-08-09T10:37:00.000Z	cellofellow	linux_kid	sounds benign
