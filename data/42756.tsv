2009-11-21T01:10:00.000Z	jcrawford		that's something I was wondering.  I have a mac pro and I am installing Ubuntu on it but how will I eject my dvd drive?  There's no button on a mac pro as mac's have the eject keyboard key

2009-11-21T01:14:00.000Z	ubuspire	jcrawford	correct. if you aren't +r then you also would end up in ##overflow
