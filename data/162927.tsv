I want the same packages installed on it that are on my other computer. Is there any way to move the package files over via CD to prevent having to download a buncha stuff again? I already tried moving what was in /var/cache/apt/archives but i'm guessing there's more somewhere

2011-03-16T07:48:00.000Z	rooly	A|i3N	check out aptoncd
