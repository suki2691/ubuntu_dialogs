2005-02-01T11:34:00.000Z	nxterra		How can I install a custom ubuntu warty (ie, openoffice,gimp,gaim,xchat,firefox,evolution,gnome) thats all.  How do I update to the lastest versions of these apps or update to (hoary).  This is only thing keeping me from switching from Fedora core 3

2005-02-01T11:35:00.000Z	nxterra	trey3	thanks...can you suggest a step by step install guide for someone like me that has little expererience with linux?
2005-02-01T11:36:00.000Z	trey3	nxterra	you'd basically be using straight debian-install ... there are many howto's for that... search 'debian-installer howto' via google...
