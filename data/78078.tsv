2009-01-24T07:47:00.000Z	phiqtion		i just installed 8.04 on a ASUS P5N7A-VM to use as a HTPC, everything went smooth until i update my nvidia drivers to current version. after that i rebooted and resolution has stayed stucked at 640x480, any thoughts on how to change resolution with this new nvidia driver. btw, my mobo is using a 9300 gpu.
