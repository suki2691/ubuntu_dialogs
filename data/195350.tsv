2006-10-03T16:15:00.000Z	LilRayRay		hi all, I am having trouble installing ndiswrapper
2006-10-03T16:16:00.000Z	LilRayRay		I unzip the ndiswrapper tar and then I type "make uninstall" like it says and I get an error
2006-10-03T16:17:00.000Z	LilRayRay		there is a channel?
2006-10-03T16:17:00.000Z	kitche	LilRayRay	you trying to install it or uninstall since make uninstall uninstalls it after you compile it
