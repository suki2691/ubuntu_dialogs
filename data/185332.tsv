2007-06-04T06:25:00.000Z	cactusbin		I attempted to install the muslim edition of ubuntu's theme (because it looks awsome) but now my entire thing is being displayed in arabic (which isn't a legal font so everything is blocks) I uninstalled the package and rebooted, but it won't work!
2007-06-04T06:25:00.000Z	cactusbin		how can I get my language back to english?
2007-06-04T06:26:00.000Z	saxin	cactusbin	muslim edition?
