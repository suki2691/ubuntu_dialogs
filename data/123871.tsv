2008-11-26T05:49:00.000Z	Fezzler1		So, I have to unmount a /dev/hdX before I can resize the partitons
2008-11-26T05:50:00.000Z	Fezzler1		If I have a 200gig HD split in two Partitons A & B.  Can I move all files on B to A and then delete partiton B if I want one big drive?
2008-11-26T05:51:00.000Z	cdm10	Fezzler1	yep, if the files are small enough to fit on A as it is now. Also, I'd back up first if I were you.
