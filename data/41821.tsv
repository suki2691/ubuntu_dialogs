If i cancel the install i get to the desktop and after manually configuring eth0 i have access to the network. I'm pretty sure the dhcp is working fine on the lan, but how can i check that?

2011-02-11T11:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	stanman246	then how did you know it was complete and error free
2011-02-11T11:59:00.000Z	stanman246	ActionParsnip	i don't.... never had any issue before.... but i just checked and it's the same as in the md5sums file
