2004-12-30T06:51:00.000Z	noam		hello, I've just upgraded to the hoady tree and it seems to have problems
2004-12-30T06:52:00.000Z	melazyboy	noam	... if it was without problems it woulden't be in development
2004-12-30T06:53:00.000Z	melazyboy	noam	you might have to rebuild the module or the kernel
2004-12-30T06:56:00.000Z	melazyboy	noam	are you building it from kernel sources or ndis sources?
