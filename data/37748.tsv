2011-05-13T10:16:00.000Z	Severian	ohsix	thanks.  I'll try that.  I thought that might be the way and wanted to check if anyone had a preferred method.  I am documenting some tweaks for a user group newsletter.

2011-05-13T10:18:00.000Z	Severian	ohsix	I think you are right.  I always just edited the file myself.  I was thinking of using dontzap because it was easy and safe to recommend.  There is less chance of someone messing up their video.
