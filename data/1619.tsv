2012-08-10T20:51:00.000Z	mowol		I am having problems with several development environments on top of each other (avr, opencv, ros, c++, java etc), so i would like a way to seperate them. I was thinking of running all development environments through an instance in virtual box, sharing workspaces to the actual computer through ubuntu one (for backup purposes) and then use the actual computer to all other things. Any ideas or thoughts about this?
