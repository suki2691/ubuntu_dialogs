2006-07-11T11:34:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		I've got a problem.
2006-07-11T11:35:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		I run the Kubuntu installation wizard, and when it detects hard disks it only detects my 360GB disk, and not the 120GB disk I want to install it on.
2006-07-11T11:36:00.000Z	snoops	DarkLegacy	is that 120gb disk on a special controller?
2006-07-11T11:37:00.000Z	DarkLegacy	snoops	I don't believe so
