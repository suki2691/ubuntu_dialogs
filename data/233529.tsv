2005-06-10T13:42:00.000Z	nosilver4u		any ideas on how to resolve a conflict with libxt6 in breezy?
2005-06-10T13:44:00.000Z	nosilver4u		it tells me to run 'apt-get -f install'
2005-06-10T13:44:00.000Z	nosilver4u		which tries to force the install, i believe, but it gives an error because there is a file that exists in another package
2005-06-10T13:44:00.000Z	lleberg_	nosilver4u	why are you running breezy? :)
