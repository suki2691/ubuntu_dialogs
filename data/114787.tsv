2008-07-17T06:59:00.000Z	Nigel_Dookie		don't mean to interrupt , but I have a small problem in the loading of the ubuntu live cd on a dell latitude..
2008-07-17T07:00:00.000Z	NCommander	Nigel_Dookie	whats the issue?
2008-07-17T07:02:00.000Z	NCommander	Nigel_Dookie	my lattitude could boot, but it paniced after startup because its a firewire based drive
