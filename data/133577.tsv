2007-05-23T09:41:00.000Z	MSTK		hi, can someone help me configure OpenSSH to allow access from remote computers that aren't in my network?  Just via the complete internet?
2007-05-23T09:42:00.000Z	putaro	MSTK	that's going to be a firewall setting
2007-05-23T09:43:00.000Z	MSTK	putaro	- so it's enabled by default for OpenSSH?  The problem is on my side then?
2007-05-23T09:45:00.000Z	putaro	MSTK	 in my home, i just set port forwarding on my firewall to send the port for ssh to the appropriate IP
