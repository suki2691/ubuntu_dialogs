2012-06-30T23:25:00.000Z	arnaldo		I dont remember trying that nemo. The drive that I need to mount has the following line: /dev/sdc1: UUID="042c6d3c-12ae-4555-92bd-9f68c540367c" TYPE="ext4"
2012-06-30T23:25:00.000Z	bekks	arnaldo	Thats an invalid line, there is no mountpoint specified, etc.
2012-06-30T23:37:00.000Z	bekks	arnaldo	No. :)
2012-06-30T23:38:00.000Z	bekks	arnaldo	He wants one single line from the file /etc/fstab
