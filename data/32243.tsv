2012-02-24T01:39:00.000Z	Jon--	woldhekkie	I am having hardware issues w unity. I've been told I can't use decorators besides unity. Means I either have to reinstall and reconfigure an image for the programming competition I'm pxe booting with ltsp, or I have to script run the things not being auto run. If you do ctrl+alt+t gnome-panel & after login you get a working gnome-panel. All applications work. I am missing alt+f2 run application support. I can't see anything else
