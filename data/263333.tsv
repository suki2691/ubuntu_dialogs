2005-04-16T15:09:00.000Z	tony		I dont understand the startup system of ubuntu. How do I automatically load a module on bootup?  I tried adding to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base, but that was a no go.
2005-04-16T15:09:00.000Z	tony		modprobe.conf seems.. absent in hoary.
2005-04-16T15:11:00.000Z	topyli	tony	i guess it's spread out into little files in modprobe.d?
2005-04-16T15:11:00.000Z	tony	topyli	I guess the answer is in that directory, but dunno what exactly.
