2009-10-07T02:00:00.000Z	Mewtwo		Hey, is there a way to force packages to install despite lack of dependencies? I have a couple packages that depend on each other (guile-1.6-libs, libguile-ltdl-1, and libqthreads-12). I'd use apt-get, but the computer I'm working on has no internet connection.

2009-10-07T02:01:00.000Z	LjL	Mewtwo	are you doing both in the same line?
2009-10-07T02:02:00.000Z	LjL	Mewtwo	like sudo dpkg -i pkg1.deb pkg2.deb
