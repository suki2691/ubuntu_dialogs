2005-09-18T15:12:00.000Z	tashiro		Hi, I have a problem with my screen resolution, its seems that the xorg server from breezy doesn't support 1600x1024 very well. http://vern.chem.tu-berlin.de/~stephan/images/ubuntu-cinemadisplay.jpg
2005-09-18T15:13:00.000Z	tashiro		Against which package should I fill a bug report?
2005-09-18T15:15:00.000Z	dsas	tashiro	xserver-xorg would probably be the best place to report a bug against...xorg is being updated pretty much daily though
2005-09-18T15:16:00.000Z	tashiro	dsas	Thanks, I will do.
