2007-02-03T17:58:00.000Z	Rob002		I've been looking, but with no luck, for a script that will rip a DVD and transcode it to XviD without human intervention. (AKA Detects longest tracks, rips, encodes). Anybody know a script that will do this? I have a bunch of DVD's I want to back up and I just want to click run, and have it do everything for me (Going to put the script into autorun when a dvd is inserted)
