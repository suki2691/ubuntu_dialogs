2010-08-19T20:45:00.000Z	figuringout		hi, i'm installing 10.04 via wubi. For some reason ubuntu fails to recognize by Broadcom wireless card. Is there something I can do so that it does? I dont have a wired line at present.

2010-08-19T20:47:00.000Z	figuringout	ZykoticK9	is there something I can do in windows to get the driver before hand?
