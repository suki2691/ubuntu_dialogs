2012-05-05T11:13:00.000Z	_jon180_		while using flash in chrome and firefox, my cpu usage is very high in 12.04, i see an unbuntu question about this but no bug report, is there a known solution?
2012-05-05T11:14:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	_jon180_	flash is a closed-source binary-blob application to which ubuntu does not have the ability to edit, so fixing bugs in it is 100% Adobe's responsability
2012-05-05T11:19:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	_jon180_	it's very hard to tell with flash. Most likely it's the newer version of flash (10.04 had an older version) that has the bug
2012-05-05T11:22:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	_jon180_	unfortunately not. Go ahead and file a bug report anyways in case someone clever can come up with a work-around
