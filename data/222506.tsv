2008-09-13T08:25:00.000Z	mrkris		Sorry, was not aware that 'ball*' was inappropriate
2008-09-13T08:26:00.000Z	mrkris		perhaps I was referring to balls as 'unstable' and 'bounces around', which, Comcast DNS suffers from.
2008-09-13T08:28:00.000Z	mneptok	mrkris	do not use that term in that kind of context again. full stop.
