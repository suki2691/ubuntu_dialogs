2010-06-18T03:01:00.000Z	Heebie	ironfroggy	I've never been able to get a VGA and an HDMI to work together.. I've always had to put an adapter on the HDMI to VGA..and use 2 VGA's. (although you SHOULD be able to get it working I would hope!)
2010-06-18T03:03:00.000Z	ironfroggy	Heebie	the hdmi is then using a dvi adapter. does that help?
2010-06-18T03:03:00.000Z	Heebie	ironfroggy	I've never used a video card with an HDMI output.. so I honestly have no clue. :(
