2007-04-29T11:03:00.000Z	Latty	user-land	Use uTorrent under wine or azureus, I find I get speeds alot slower with ktorrent, and it'd go around your problem.
2007-04-29T11:04:00.000Z	Latty	user-land	uTorrent is fine, only thing it it won't minimise to tray
2007-04-29T11:05:00.000Z	Latty	user-land	NP. Azureus can be a resource hog, mind, and uTorrent can have some GUI problems with wine, but they both, for me, work better than ktorrent.
