2012-08-14T10:33:00.000Z	OerHeks	howardgrigg	a gui for what? you could install any desktop on top of it, or a light one
2012-08-14T10:34:00.000Z	OerHeks		!desktop
2012-08-14T10:35:00.000Z	howardgrigg	OerHeks	well initially I'm just going to use it as a pled media server and torrent downloader but if I want to use it as an HTPC later on then I'll need something..
