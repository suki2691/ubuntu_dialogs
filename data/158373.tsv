2009-01-18T02:30:00.000Z	takagami		anyone have a few mins to help me with a simple problem
2009-01-18T02:30:00.000Z	takagami		heh
2009-01-18T02:31:00.000Z	takagami		Running Ibex 64bit server installed xorg and openbox... when I startx my wireless keyboard and touchpad combo no longer works except for ctrl-alt-delete
2009-01-18T02:32:00.000Z	Slart	takagami	hmm.. odd that ctrl+alt+delete works and nothing else.. that clearly means it does connect and send register keys
