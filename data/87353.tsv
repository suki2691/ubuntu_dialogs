2009-04-04T21:43:00.000Z	Kelen	vermin	just edit /boot/grub/menu.* and remove the word "splash"
2009-04-04T21:45:00.000Z	Kelen	vermin	you'd better back up the file before you do this.
2009-04-04T21:46:00.000Z	vermin	Kelen	sry, but I meant using the live boot cd. Trying to boot into runlevel 1right now since runlevel 1 doesnt boot gdm
