2009-08-08T07:01:00.000Z	Darxus		I'm having unexpected difficulty getting the windows XP defragger to move everything to the beginning of the disk for repartitioning, any recommendations?  I'm surprised google hasn't been more helpful.

2009-08-08T07:02:00.000Z	Darxus	DasEi	Previous versions of defrag did it.  What has that job?
