2010-11-09T00:37:00.000Z	holmser		One more random question: I am trying to use a 10.10 bootable flash drive to reinstall ubuntu, but it keeps failing because the squashfs has bad blocks?
2010-11-09T00:39:00.000Z	Guest25127	holmser	yes
2010-11-09T00:39:00.000Z	holmser	Guest25127	care to explain?
2010-11-09T00:39:00.000Z	Guest25127	holmser	simply go into the flash drive directory and md5 it from there
