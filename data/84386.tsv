2012-09-15T02:35:00.000Z	SteveThing		if I'm using irssi (CLI) and want to "minimize" it and execute shell commands, and then go back to irssi, how would i do that without exiting?
2012-09-15T02:37:00.000Z	SteveThing		please forgive my ignorance, but how would I use that to go back to CLI without closing irssi?
2012-09-15T02:37:00.000Z	szal	SteveThing	use what?
