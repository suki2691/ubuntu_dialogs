2005-08-02T12:36:00.000Z	ryanja		I've switched from suse to ubuntu, and with suse pushing more towards kde i didn't know how I was going to like gnome.  I actually like gnome better and haven't found a reason to go back to kde,  does anyone prefere kde over gnome.
2005-08-02T12:37:00.000Z	ryanja		i do like k3b, its a nice burning progam, but other then that not much
