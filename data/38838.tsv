2010-01-22T06:50:00.000Z	ultraparadigm		I can't seem to run anything with Wine
2010-01-22T06:51:00.000Z	ultraparadigm		Is Wine supposed to work on 64bit Ubuntu, or does it only work on 32bit Ubuntu with 32bit windows applications?
2010-01-22T06:51:00.000Z	DasEi	ultraparadigm	64 is fine, too
2010-01-22T06:52:00.000Z	ultraparadigm	DasEi	Do you know if I can run 32 bit applications with wine in 64bit Ubuntu?
