2010-10-30T23:00:00.000Z	Access_Violation	ray9na	You can't upgrade. So maybe you screwed up your system.
2010-10-30T23:04:00.000Z	Access_Violation	ray9na	Well, i'm not sure how does it works but, ubuntu has a tool that allows you to create a startup disk. Go to System-Management-StartUp Disk Creator.
