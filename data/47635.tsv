2010-05-11T19:37:00.000Z	braindump		I've been issuing safe-upgrade command every few days since 10.04 was released, and every time it finds new stuff to do
2010-05-11T19:38:00.000Z	braindump		I am not sure why, I thought safe-up replaced dist-up, and that you really only have to do that once for each major version
2010-05-11T19:38:00.000Z	braindump		if someone knows more about this, would appreciate any clarification
2010-05-11T19:40:00.000Z	theadmin	braindump	Well yeah that's how it works
