2012-08-18T23:36:00.000Z	scott_z	nabam	I had the same problem when I upgraded my kernel a few versions back. Still have not gotten it to work. Bought a usb wifi and it fixed the problem. I reinstalled with the 12.04 cd and it fixed the problem but the minute i ran all the upgrades it stopped working again. Still working on it. Sorry.
