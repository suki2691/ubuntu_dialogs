2008-10-24T03:31:00.000Z	mongolai	GodfatherofEire	 did you save your session when the startup manager was running?
2008-10-24T03:34:00.000Z	mongolai	GodfatherofEire	 no idea, but you can go to System>prefs>sessions and start looking around there
2008-10-24T03:38:00.000Z	mongolai	GodfatherofEire	 i don't really know
