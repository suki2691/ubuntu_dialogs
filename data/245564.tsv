2006-10-28T10:24:00.000Z	coolrazor		isn't ruby for web?  I mean like full blown apps and stuff
2006-10-28T10:25:00.000Z	coolrazor		is python a scripting language or full language?
2006-10-28T10:26:00.000Z	sproingie	coolrazor	the line between "scripting language" and "real language" is mighty blurry these days
