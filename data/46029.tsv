2010-01-08T12:15:00.000Z	Organizm	FireCrotch	yeah.  but you figure if it's caching 800MB, i'd have downloaded that much... i've got a 1Mb connection... there isn't time to get that much content.  so like i said, i haven't a clue what it's using that for.
2010-01-08T12:16:00.000Z	FireCrotch	Organizm	memory leak caused by a poorly written extension?
2010-01-08T12:17:00.000Z	Organizm	FireCrotch	i do have some third party plugins.  that's certainly possible.
