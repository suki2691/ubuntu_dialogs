2010-06-03T15:58:00.000Z	dude_		Quick question, can ubuntu read and write the NTFS filesystem?
2010-06-03T15:58:00.000Z	dude_		I'm setting up a new machine and want a shared drive for my W7 and ubuntu. FAT32 is out of the question because of the 2 GB file size limit
2010-06-03T15:59:00.000Z	Warm_HUG	dude_	no problem
