2012-04-06T08:31:00.000Z	itaylor57	knownothing	you can't upgrade to beta LTS, you will have to wait for release
2012-04-06T08:32:00.000Z	itaylor57	knownothing	you would have to upgrade to 11.04 _> 11.10 then 12.04
2012-04-06T08:33:00.000Z	itaylor57	knownothing	if you wait formal release you can directly go from 10.04 to 12.04
