2011-04-15T03:59:00.000Z	bcessa		hi there, hope someone can help me out with this, how can I obtain a SHA1 or MD5 checksum of a directory and/or of it's contents recursively ?
2011-04-15T04:00:00.000Z	gnosis	bcessa	i don't believe you can pass a directory to sha1sum
2011-04-15T04:00:00.000Z	gnosis	bcessa	you could make a tar and then then find its sha1
2011-04-15T04:03:00.000Z	bcessa	gnosis	ok, thnx
