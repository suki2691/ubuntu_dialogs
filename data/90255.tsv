2008-06-16T02:46:00.000Z	Darlok_Williams		How do I make clicking on URL's from other programs actually open in Firefox?  For example, when clicking on an applications homepage link in Add/Remove, nothing happens...
2008-06-16T02:47:00.000Z	joaopinto	Darlok_Williams	that is something that needs to be implemented at the application level, on the case of the Add/Remove application there is no support to visit the links
2008-06-16T02:48:00.000Z	Darlok_Williams	joaopinto	Then why do the developers make the links blue?  Isn't it common knowledge that blue links (link by definition suggests the ability to visit them) are clickable? :)
2008-06-16T02:48:00.000Z	joaopinto	Darlok_Williams	well, maybe you should file a bug report for it :)
