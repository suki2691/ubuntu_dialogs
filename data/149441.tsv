I found it a while ago, cleaned out my internet history, and I cant remember where to find it. I've been searching google for days. It was a really long ebook, not quite a tutorial, it had over 40 chapters, and described hardware, and the origins of binary and ascii and all that too
2009-07-14T23:46:00.000Z	JamesHoldsworth		i know it's a little vague, I'm trying to think of more specific things to mention, like when I was looking for it I was looking for a terminal tutorial... I remember they showed a picture of a mobo, and it was really old lol. It was a grey drawing lol. lol.
