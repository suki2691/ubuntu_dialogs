2010-08-04T22:34:00.000Z	[zz]		So I'm having this weird issue where networking on 10.04 seems to just suddenly stop for no reason. Icon disappears from the notification area and everything. Anyone know why that might be and how to prevent it?
2010-08-04T22:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	[zz]	look into « dmesg » output
2010-08-04T22:37:00.000Z	[zz]	erUSUL	anything in particular I should be looking for in it?
2010-08-04T22:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	[zz]	erro messages from wlan0 or so
