2006-12-31T10:32:00.000Z	DarthLappy		How can I get mpg123 to play files recursively?  I have all my music organised into folders so it won't play anything other than the top level.

2006-12-31T10:33:00.000Z	DarthLappy	nolimitsoya	I'd like to play stuff via the commandline though.
2006-12-31T10:35:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	DarthLappy	how about mpd?
