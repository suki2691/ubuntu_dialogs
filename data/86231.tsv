2008-07-07T04:21:00.000Z	surbahns		I have a Linux server the houses all my media on it. Is there a application that would index all my media and create a almost intranet website that I could use to show which media I do and don't have? Say thumbnails from movie clips and/or flash players to stream a MP3?

2008-07-07T04:23:00.000Z	surbahns	M_Cheevy	Yeah. Thanks. But if there was a package already out there I would rather work with a team then try to building something from fresh
