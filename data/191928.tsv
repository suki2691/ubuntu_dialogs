2006-08-09T09:45:00.000Z	Nimwei		Greetings - I just downloaded the i386 6.06 alternat iso from the website and burned it but it doesn't appear to be a bootable CD. Is there a way to get it to boot? I've got a IBM boot CD with a "boot:" prompt...any ideas?

2006-08-09T09:48:00.000Z	orbin	Nimwei	have you checked that the cd drive is the first boot device in bios?
