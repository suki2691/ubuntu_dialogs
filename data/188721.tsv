2009-04-24T09:44:00.000Z	EvanCarroll	XiXaQ	and mucking around with it for an hour, it isn't working with non-defaults either
2009-04-24T09:44:00.000Z	XiXaQ	EvanCarroll	what does "doesn't work" mean?
2009-04-24T09:46:00.000Z	EvanCarroll	XiXaQ	I mean, ontop of the same old bugs in 8.10, now my apple keyboard only connects successfully on half of the attempts, hcitool --scan doesn't show my devices, it won't connect to them for some weird reason describe on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bluez/+bug/343727 and when i get a connection a powercycle or HUP To the daemon results in loosing the connection without chance to reconnect
