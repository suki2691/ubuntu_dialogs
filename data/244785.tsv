2009-10-27T00:52:00.000Z	domo		if i download ubuntu 9.10.. is it essentially the same that will be released on the 29th? i mean the release schedule says theres only language pack changes and such...
2009-10-27T00:53:00.000Z	domo		it will magically become the stable one
2009-10-27T00:53:00.000Z	domo		the reason i ask is because im setting up a new box right now and i want grub2 and other things with 9.10 and i dont feel like waiting
