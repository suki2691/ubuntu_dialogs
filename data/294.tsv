2012-11-26T00:00:00.000Z	Baeein		got a couple of problems with ubuntu 12.10, please help me out: 1. unity is gone, after i installed fgrlx-updates for my AMD HD6850 card and 2. GRUB 2 didnt get properly installed, fixed it with livecd and boot repair. But now i have to select to boot from Ubunut, instead of it auto-booting for me.
