2009-05-11T12:36:00.000Z	thahauss		I just finished setting up my Raid array in Ubuntu 9.04 but am unsure of what filesystem will be best in my situation.  I want the best performance possible as I will be compressing large files, and windows machines on the network need to be able to access the data.  Any advice?
2009-05-11T12:36:00.000Z	xPhilosx	thahauss	is it a real raid array or fake raid?
2009-05-11T12:37:00.000Z	thahauss	xPhilosx	a true raid using a dell perc 5i
2009-05-11T12:37:00.000Z	xPhilosx	thahauss	ah okay, i was gonna suggest not even wasting your time, because 95% of the time its soft-raid.  Sorry though, I dont know much about actual raid and optimizations
