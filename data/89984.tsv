2008-05-22T03:35:00.000Z	illriginal		Does anyone know if there's any updates needed in order to make Hardy (8.04) more stable/reliable? It seems a tad buggy right now.
2008-05-22T03:35:00.000Z	illriginal		hfp... check your resolution then.
2008-05-22T03:36:00.000Z	hfp	illriginal	I checked my resolution and it is correct, that is, the same resolution I had on vista.
