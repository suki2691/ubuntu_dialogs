2009-01-05T22:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	LinuxGhost	 you sure it even has ANY linux support at all?
2009-01-05T22:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	LinuxGhost	 You would have to check for your specific tuner and see if it has linux support. Google/forums/hardware support list
2009-01-05T22:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	LinuxGhost	 If its supported.. it should work.. if its not.. then it wont.  Its possible it may get support  in the future. Its hard to tell  - it depends on the exact tuner/card/thing.
