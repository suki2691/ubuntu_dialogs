2011-02-21T00:03:00.000Z	vocx	anfegame	you need to explain more. What is this high priority you are talking about?
2011-02-21T00:05:00.000Z	vocx	anfegame	but what does high priority mean for you? You want it to take all available resources or what?
2011-02-21T00:10:00.000Z	vocx	anfegame	what you want is real time, not high priority
