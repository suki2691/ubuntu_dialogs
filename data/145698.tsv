2007-09-29T16:16:00.000Z	Flare183		how many drives can ubuntu handle?
2007-09-29T16:17:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Flare183	probably as many as you can throw at it
2008-02-11T00:46:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Flare183	the ubuntu package is broken, not the flash from adobe's site
2008-02-11T00:47:00.000Z	Flare183	MasterShrek	just figured that out
