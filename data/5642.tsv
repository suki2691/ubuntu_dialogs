2012-03-16T23:17:00.000Z	limescout		hey, I want to upgrade from Linux mint 9 to the latest version of Ubuntu.  I have my /home folder in a different partition.  Would it be safe to just unmount my /home, and mount it into 11.10?

2012-03-16T23:19:00.000Z	limescout	MonkeyDust	any problems I should watch out for?  Or can i just go ahead and install ubuntu over Mint?
