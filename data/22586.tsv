2010-11-18T08:02:00.000Z	Guest20352		I am using Xubuntu, where would I report a bug if after pressing several time "toggle touchpad on/off" on HP Compaq Presario CQ61-400EW I got input/output error and other weird messages and I was unable to input anything from keyboard until I restarted X server (alt+ctrl+backspace didn't work, but alt+ctr+f1 worked)? Or what steps should I take to further investigate what causes the problem?
2010-11-18T08:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest20352	you can re-enable CAB in keyboard settnigs
2010-11-18T08:09:00.000Z	Guest20352	ActionParsnip	OK, good to know about CAB, but I would still like to make my computer stable. Is there any keyboard input daemon or something that has a bug tracker separate from X server? And generally should I seek assistance at people developing X11 or XFCE? Should I test my case further running different desktop environments?
2010-11-18T08:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest20352	could try these boot options in various combinations:   i8024.reset   i8024.nomux=1   irqpoll    may help
