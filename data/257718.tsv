2007-02-06T11:24:00.000Z	GoopyMonkey		will I be able to install linux with only one hard drive? When I try to make a partition, it says only 8MB free in the new partition.
2007-02-06T11:26:00.000Z	GoopyMonkey		So if I wanted to install linux, I would need to replace windows, or buy a new hard drive?
2007-02-06T11:28:00.000Z	GoopyMonkey		would that limit how many applications i can install under windows?
