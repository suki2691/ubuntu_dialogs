2006-06-06T11:27:00.000Z	jak	Nisku	2.14.1 gnome is runing in my dapper
2006-06-06T11:28:00.000Z	Nisku	jak	 True but the devel version of Gnome due in Sept is 2.15 (to be 2.16) .  I just wonder if an upgrade will be available to Dapper or will it be in the next Ubuntu release.
2006-06-06T11:29:00.000Z	jak	Nisku	seeing as the next ubuntu release shold be in october i would guess that it would be in the next release
