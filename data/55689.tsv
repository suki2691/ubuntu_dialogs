2009-06-14T19:12:00.000Z	ra1		Hello all
2009-06-14T19:13:00.000Z	ra1		I have not been able to log in to my computer since today morning. The username and password are not getting recognised, and they haven't been changed.
2009-06-14T19:14:00.000Z	ra1		I have booted in through the livecd, and it seems my home directory and everything is still in place.
2009-06-14T19:14:00.000Z	Jyxt	ra1	if you booted into livecd, can you chroot into the install and change passwd there?
