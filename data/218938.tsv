2007-05-06T09:28:00.000Z	kaptnemo		so I'm attempting to edit my fstab and when attempting to save I get an error "unable to open file to write" wtf does that mean?
2007-05-06T09:28:00.000Z	kaptnemo		I went into the terminal and did su and switched to root (near as I can tell)
2007-05-06T09:28:00.000Z	jpjacobs	kaptnemo	you can only write it when using sudo
