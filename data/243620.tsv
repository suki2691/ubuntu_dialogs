2005-04-24T08:55:00.000Z	dandesmet		i have a comp with windows xp on it on one hard drive...if i have a second blank hard drive, how hard would it be for me to install it as a slave to the current one, and install ubuntu without touching my windows xp install?
2005-04-24T08:56:00.000Z	dandesmet		if i make ubuntu drive the slave, which bootloader would come up when i start my computer, ntldr or grub?
