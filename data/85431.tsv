2008-08-02T12:23:00.000Z	Miksag1	[TiZ]	not sure; like i said, i use rhythmbox; i didn't really like Quod Libet, as it didn't have feed support for podcasts
2008-08-02T12:26:00.000Z	Miksag1	[TiZ]	hmm, i guess check their website, see if it says you need anything for it to run properly
2008-08-02T12:26:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Miksag1	I'll do that.
