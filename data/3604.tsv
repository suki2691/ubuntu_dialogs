2012-04-29T09:36:00.000Z	gaelfx	phoenixK	yeah, I understand. I like ubuntu, it's relatively painless compared to other distros, for me at least
2012-04-29T09:37:00.000Z	gaelfx	phoenixK	but with arch, I had such a greater sense of accomplishment when something finally actually worked :D
2012-04-29T09:38:00.000Z	phoenixK	gaelfx	haha nice
