2009-11-04T10:18:00.000Z	hans		I just got my new laptop HDD in the mail. Is there some way I can put the Ubuntu installer on my new HDD without having to burn it to anything? I have an external enclosure, could I "dd if=/blah/ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sde1/" ?
2009-11-04T10:18:00.000Z	hans		and THEN plug the new HDD into my laptop and just fire it up?
2009-11-04T10:19:00.000Z	bluejeans	hans	why not just clone the whole HD?
2009-11-04T10:19:00.000Z	hans	bluejeans	I want to reinstall, I orignally installed with 9.10a and it's being buggy, want a fresh install
