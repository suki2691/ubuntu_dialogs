2011-04-23T23:35:00.000Z	vinceN		I am looking for some advise on the best and least complicated way to sync a single directory in my home folder between two computers.  A desktop and a laptop.  What I want is for them to sync too each other.  Mostly traffic will be going to the Laptop but in the event I add something to the laptop I want it to sync back to the desktop the next time we are on the local network.  Does anyone have any tips or how tos on the best way to accomplish this?
