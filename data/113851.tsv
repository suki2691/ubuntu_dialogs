2008-02-17T21:15:00.000Z	Aqua2		anyone know a good way to do a full image/backup of my root partition??
2008-02-17T21:15:00.000Z	_mug	Aqua2	boot knoppix or something and dd
2008-02-17T21:16:00.000Z	_mug	Aqua2	type man dd
2008-02-17T21:17:00.000Z	_mug	Aqua2	but dd will backup even the empty diskspace
