2012-01-13T00:16:00.000Z	dajhorn	GranCenSail1	Which backup script?  The .gvfs folder is used by the GNOME mount manager.
2012-01-13T00:16:00.000Z	GranCenSail1	dajhorn	It's one that my friend wrote for me that's supposed to make a .tar out of my home folder and save it to an external harddrive.
2012-01-13T00:17:00.000Z	dajhorn	GranCenSail1	 Find the tar command in the backup script and add the --one-file-system switch.
2012-01-13T00:23:00.000Z	GranCenSail1	dajhorn	Thanks for your help.  I added the command and am running the script now.
