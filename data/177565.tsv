2007-08-01T06:08:00.000Z	tbender		hi. somehow, i managed to change my system wide keyboard setting to us, which is definetly wrong. I already changed the keyboard to de-de for my users, but still gdm, uses us-keyboard. is there a graphical interface to change the setting, or do i just have to edit xorg.conf? thx...

2007-08-01T06:25:00.000Z	tbender	Jack_Sparrow	thx for your help. I couldnt find a preference pane to chnage my keyboard settings system wide. I just edited corg.conf now. that worked. Thank you
