2006-12-11T09:27:00.000Z	synesthesia		Hi, I'm trying to install the server edition of Ubuntu -- I want to just add the desktop component after I've set it up. What's the easiest way to do this (what's the package name for the desktop?)
2006-12-11T09:28:00.000Z	synesthesia		I know the console. I have a reason for wanting the desktop.
