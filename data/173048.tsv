2006-08-13T06:26:00.000Z	marinelli59		the driver is specific for each database vendor
2006-08-13T06:27:00.000Z	marinelli59		other question: how do you make a rlogin (I tried, but "connection refused" error message appears)
2006-08-13T06:28:00.000Z	longwave	marinelli59	you need to look in the documentation for the specific jdbc driver you are trying to use
