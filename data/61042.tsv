2010-10-02T16:51:00.000Z	vu1kan		top doesn't do me any good, really, i'm wanting to know what application is suddenly sucking my ram(and i am aware of the fact that linux uses unallocated ram as a cache), i'll be watching a movie, and my ram usage will go from 40% to max in a matter of seconds...completely randomly.
