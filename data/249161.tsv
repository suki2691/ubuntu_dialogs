2005-03-01T08:47:00.000Z	Ainvar		yeah the build of haory from the repos is running very nice
2005-03-01T08:49:00.000Z	Ainvar		so is there a list of extra repos for hoary like there was for warty that was listed in the unofficial ubuntu guide?
2005-03-01T08:50:00.000Z	Ainvar		or can I just do a replace of warty with hoary in repos that have warty listed in them?
2005-03-01T08:51:00.000Z	ne0genius	Ainvar	i was wondering the same thing
