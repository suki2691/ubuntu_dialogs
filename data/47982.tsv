2010-04-06T10:48:00.000Z	theadmin	voss749	Won't work. Updates only happen from one version to next one (i.e. from 8.10 to 9.04, from 9.04 to 9.10... etc)
2010-04-06T10:49:00.000Z	voss749	theadmin	I never said it would take only one update
2010-04-06T10:49:00.000Z	theadmin	voss749	Oh. Makes sense then
