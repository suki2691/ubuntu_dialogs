2005-08-09T11:47:00.000Z	f_newton	vagamente	first you need to find out where it is
2005-08-09T11:49:00.000Z	f_newton	vagamente	if you installed limewire by apt or aptitude you can remove it that way
2005-08-09T11:49:00.000Z	f_newton	vagamente	I dont know what that is but I do know if you find all the files you can rm -f them but you better know wht you are doing and not remove the wrong directories
