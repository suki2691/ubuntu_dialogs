2010-09-08T14:41:00.000Z	glebihan	Kimiskov	the only one I know is CLAM, it works quite well
2010-09-08T14:41:00.000Z	glebihan	Kimiskov	but I don't know how it'll handle scanning your Windows system
2010-09-08T14:43:00.000Z	glebihan	Kimiskov	well yes it's its main function, but it also does file system scans
