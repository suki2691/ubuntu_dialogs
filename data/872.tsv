2012-10-29T17:04:00.000Z	allu3	kennen	if i'm not mistaken something like init 2
2012-10-29T17:04:00.000Z	allu3		uh i hate when i've forgot to scroll down irssi..
2012-10-29T17:05:00.000Z	kennen	allu3	yes i want to run my system in text-mode, thats no problem but i cant acces the grup2 menu on boot ...
