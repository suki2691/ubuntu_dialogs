2008-02-23T03:09:00.000Z	luisa		Can anyone tell me another way of installing Flash player plug in for firefox? From Flash website it doesnt work, from Add/Remove it doesn't work.
2008-02-23T03:11:00.000Z	Slart	luisa	start by removing it and then reinstall it.. "sudo apt-get remove --purge flash-plugin-nonfree".
