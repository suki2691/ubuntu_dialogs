2009-12-26T08:22:00.000Z	maco	bllz	 and Cappy described *exactly* what happens with the 9250 with open v. closed. the closed drivers get 1 frame every few seconds, and the open drivers fly
2009-12-26T08:23:00.000Z	bllz	maco	 I must have missed it
2009-12-26T08:23:00.000Z	maco	bllz	im responding to "you may not want the open drivers then" when Cappy said they want something that doesnt lag horribly.  the closed ones are extremely laggy on some cards
