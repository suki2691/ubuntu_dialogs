2007-10-19T23:52:00.000Z	PovAddict		well, now I have "normal" visual effects
2007-10-19T23:53:00.000Z	PovAddict		I see shadow and some animations, but what I'd really like is antialiased corners
2007-10-19T23:53:00.000Z	PovAddict		is there any theme like "human" but with antialiased rounded corners?
