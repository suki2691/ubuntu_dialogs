2008-04-07T20:46:00.000Z	jimcooncat_	bazhang	I recently got three machines which I loaded 4gb ram each on, I'll be using them as servers and run kvm on them. Do you think it's worth it to do amd64 on them? I'll be running 32-bit guests.
2008-04-07T20:47:00.000Z	bazhang	jimcooncat_	for servers? might not be bad, especially as you dont need to use/configure youtube--flash
2008-04-07T20:49:00.000Z	jimcooncat_	bazhang	I'm just wondering if it will make it worthwhile, if all I get is the rest of my fourth GB out if it.
2008-04-07T20:50:00.000Z	bazhang	jimcooncat_	you make a good point; you might want to ask in #ubuntu-server for an expert opinion ;]
