2007-06-02T16:13:00.000Z	Falstius	gif89apro	yeah, you can with nis+.
2007-06-02T16:16:00.000Z	Falstius	gif89apro	you set up one machine on the network as an nis server.  The others as clients.  they can share almost any configuration file, but primarly it is used for hostnames, ssh keys, and logins.  You'll have to google for detailed instructions.  It isn't terribly complicated, but you should be very comfortable with the command line.
