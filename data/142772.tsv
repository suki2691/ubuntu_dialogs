2008-02-09T13:25:00.000Z	panfist	bullgard4	does intel have an onboard video chipset that is capable of effects in compiz fusion while the comp is playing back h264 hd? right now with my ti4200 agp it stutters with desktop effects enabled
2008-02-09T13:26:00.000Z	bullgard4	panfist	I am not using compiz fusion.
