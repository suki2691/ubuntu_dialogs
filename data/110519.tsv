2012-01-11T06:20:00.000Z	ld50		Hi, I'm having weird problems trying to install 11.10 on a macbook pro. Weird, because it worked initially, then I messed up with installing xfce packages and deleting unity. Then I realised I should just have installed xubuntu. Tried that but it crashes sometime before the login screen looks with a colourful mess -- like a hardware graphics problem
2012-01-11T06:22:00.000Z	ld50		And I'm not getting the nvidia drivers offered anymore. Although I did initially. Somehow. Weird :-(

2012-01-11T06:23:00.000Z	aBound	ld50	Did you go to Additional Hardware and check if they were there? Or are they not listed.
