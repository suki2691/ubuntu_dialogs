2012-09-23T07:32:00.000Z	drelyn86	Sirisian	12.10 is handling that a little differently
2012-09-23T07:33:00.000Z	drelyn86	Sirisian	basically it's the GPU, but if GPU acceleration is not available then it's the CPU
2012-09-23T07:33:00.000Z	drelyn86	Sirisian	but in 12.04 and earlier if GPU acceleration is not available then it just falls back to 2d mode... so in short, 2d mode unity is being retired in 12.10
