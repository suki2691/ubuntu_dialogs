2009-03-30T14:06:00.000Z	ac3		I updated my scsi controller from BusLogic to LSI Logic in VMware, and now iÂ´m not able to boot anymore. Error message: volumegroup debian not found. I booted with a livecd and updated the initrd but no luck.
2009-03-30T14:07:00.000Z	ac3		any ideas?
2009-03-30T14:07:00.000Z	AD2008	ac3	- set it back to buslogic?
2009-03-30T14:07:00.000Z	ac3	AD2008	that's not an option
