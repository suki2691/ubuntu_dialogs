2009-05-19T09:39:00.000Z	ed2ef		i was trying to find some documentation to explain better how to switch the driver to bcm43xx, but on ubuntu, at least on the wiki, the default driver is the ndis
2009-05-19T09:40:00.000Z	ed2ef		i think is bcm43xx
2009-05-19T09:40:00.000Z	ed2ef		the name of the project
2009-05-19T09:40:00.000Z	cr0w	ed2ef	i've always found using ndiswrapper was alot simpler than fooling around with the bcm43xx drivers..
