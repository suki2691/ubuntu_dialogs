2008-02-07T04:25:00.000Z	putnum		i installed kubuntu and I love it! But i get a message before x loads saying my monitor is out of synch any ideas why?
2008-02-07T04:25:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubunti	putnum	because you don't have the right sync rates in your xorg.conf file maybe?
2008-02-07T04:26:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubunti	putnum	find out what your sync is, and edit your xorg.conf files at /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-02-07T04:27:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubunti	putnum	I have to say Monitor Manual would go along way?
