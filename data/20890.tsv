2011-01-21T10:06:00.000Z	sdferfx		Hello. Is there an easy way to download needed deb and all its dependencies on not-Ubuntu? A script that will do it for me or something?
2011-01-21T10:06:00.000Z	sdferfx		Because I need to install some stuff on a ubuntu machine without net
2011-01-21T10:06:00.000Z	sdferfx		and want to copy all needed stuff over so I don't have to deal with it
2011-01-21T10:06:00.000Z	DaGeek247	sdferfx	i want an answer to that too.
