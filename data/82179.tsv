2011-05-03T14:20:00.000Z	maheanuu		I have been using Gimp for years and find that I can do pretty much everything that is needed, or at least accdording to my needs.
2011-05-03T14:22:00.000Z	marenostrum	maheanuu	I, too, use just GIMP. I do many things with it. But I'm not a professinal and I even don't know 90 % of it maybe. But I can do pretty much things witjh it. Without GIMP life would be really hard for me.
