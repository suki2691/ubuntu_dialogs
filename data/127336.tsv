2007-07-23T15:03:00.000Z	Simo1		Here's my problem: When I press the button in my panel to open the shutdown/logout dialog my computer freezes. please help.
2007-07-23T15:03:00.000Z	tetonca	Simo1	close all open applications first.
2007-07-23T15:04:00.000Z	tetonca	Simo1	yes, until you figure out what else may be broken.
2007-07-23T15:05:00.000Z	tetonca	Simo1	near as I can guess it's hanging because an application won't quit on its own, so I'm saying to quit all of them manually before logging out/shutting down.  The place to shut down Ubuntu is in the first login screen, where it asks for your password.
