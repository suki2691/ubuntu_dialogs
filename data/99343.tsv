2008-09-06T18:03:00.000Z	ShackJack		Hi all question re: Open torrent files from Firefox with Transmission. I get an "unknown error" and it suggest I try saving the file first. I tried selecting "open with /usr/bin/transmission" which works once, but on subsequent clicks just download the .torrent files in /tmp - any suggestions?

2008-09-06T18:05:00.000Z	ShackJack	hischild	Thanks, yes I know that part ;) Was wonder if there was a way to fix it so when I click on a torrent file in FF it will open Transmission properly and start it (or add it to Transmission and start it)
2008-09-06T18:05:00.000Z	hischild	ShackJack	that's my workaround that has served me well for many months so far.
