2009-02-22T18:04:00.000Z	adam7	Atlantes	the best way to do it is to go to a site that needs flash or java and when firefox asks "do you want to install the plugin" click yes
2009-02-22T18:06:00.000Z	adam7	Atlantes	yep, I'm using it now
2009-02-22T18:08:00.000Z	Atlantes	adam7	flash works, thought that didn't worked with 64bit great :D
