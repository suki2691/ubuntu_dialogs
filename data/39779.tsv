2010-01-02T08:05:00.000Z	NamVet	losha	w/ the problems or fixed?
2010-01-02T08:06:00.000Z	losha	NamVet	sorry, but that depends on why the problem is there in the first place. If it's a misconfig, reinstalling might fix it. No guarantees though, sorry...
2010-01-02T08:07:00.000Z	losha	NamVet	good luck....
