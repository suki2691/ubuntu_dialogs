2010-08-03T01:56:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	unclemike	you would probably need to do that from a liveCD or a gpartedCD since you can not resize a mounted partition
2010-08-03T01:57:00.000Z	unclemike	bastid_raZor	i remember in other distro's you could resize while in the distro
2010-08-03T01:58:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	unclemike	gparted does not allow resizing a mounted partition. there is no way around that.
