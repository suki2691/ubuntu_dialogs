2010-06-12T14:03:00.000Z	tobo		hi guys, i just updated to lucid and when i boot it's caomplaining about / (root) not being ready, if i do S or M the disk /dev/sda1 is there and i can remount rw and so on, not really sure what's wrong
2010-06-12T14:04:00.000Z	tobo		also, removed all entries but /dev/sda1 to / but still no dice
2010-06-12T14:04:00.000Z	tobo		I've googled my ass of here but haven't found anything useful
