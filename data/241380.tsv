2005-04-25T14:12:00.000Z	djm62	falkem_v4	parted is good, or a graphical shell for parted
2005-04-25T14:13:00.000Z	djm62	falkem_v4	bear in mind resizing mounted disks NOT recommended...you can boot from a parted floppy (or livecd with parted)
2005-04-25T14:14:00.000Z	djm62	falkem_v4	I think qparted is still current
