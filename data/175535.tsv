2006-07-12T08:23:00.000Z	darkyoshi372		I installed an awesome GTK2 theme, but Nautilus and Gedit, among others, use the ugly default Gnome theme! How do I make them pretty?
2006-07-12T08:23:00.000Z	tailsfan	darkyoshi372	where did you get the theme from?
2006-07-12T08:24:00.000Z	darkyoshi372	tailsfan	It's the whole Candido thing, and I supposedly had to install an engine package to use it.
2006-07-12T08:28:00.000Z	darkyoshi372	tailsfan	Thanks for the help, it turns out that it only happens when I'm running a specific app as root, which make perfect sense. Again, thanks!
