2007-05-31T13:39:00.000Z	CheshireViking	Kaitlyn2004	just jumping in here because I've had the gnome settings error in the past, are booting from the live cd or from an installed copy of ubuntu? i got the error only when booting from the livecd & had to use the alternate cd to install
2007-05-31T13:39:00.000Z	Kaitlyn2004	CheshireViking	After install... not from cd (install went fine)... and I tried the alternate cd
2007-05-31T13:40:00.000Z	CheshireViking	Kaitlyn2004	PurpZeY, ok, just thought i'd ask the question, i'll go back to sleep for a bit now
2007-05-31T13:51:00.000Z	CheshireViking	Kaitlyn2004	if you're still around, i was just looking on ubuntuforums about the error & found this thread, maybe there's something in it that'll help http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=406054
