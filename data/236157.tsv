2008-05-12T14:01:00.000Z	Dvyjones		My bcm4306 (14e4:4320) wireless card doesn't work... I can see all networks in NetworkManager, but when I try to connect to them, the icon spins for about 30 seconds, before the icon switch to the orange-triangle "No network connection" icon. In syslog, I get the message "Old device 'wlan0' activating, won't change" many times. I am using Ubuntu 8.04 LT
