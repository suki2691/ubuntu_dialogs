2012-10-03T20:53:00.000Z	trinode		Hey, I've replaced my network card, now ubuntu is calling the new card eth1, can I make it forget it ever saw the old card and just call the new one eth0?

2012-10-03T20:56:00.000Z	trinode	mknarr_	are you sure? that tells it the settings to use for each interface, not what to call  each interface
2012-10-03T20:58:00.000Z	trinode	mknarr_	looks like Â /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules has something to do with it
