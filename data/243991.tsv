2005-08-10T05:45:00.000Z	black_Nightmare		I think the livecd is Hoary
2005-08-10T05:45:00.000Z	zAo^	black_Nightmare	I think so yes
2005-08-10T05:46:00.000Z	black_Nightmare	zAo^	hm ty I was curious about using the livecd to transfer things from another pc to this pc just once without having to bother installing the window drivers for the cable etc
