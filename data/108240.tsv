2007-12-28T10:11:00.000Z	alexandroid		still waiting with my question. =) To put it simple: how do I check that grub is installed ok in external HDD and it is bootable?
2007-12-28T10:11:00.000Z	nickrud	alexandroid	try to boot ? ;)
2007-12-28T10:15:00.000Z	nickrud	alexandroid	try editing the menu.lst , find the kernel line that has quiet splash on it. Remove those words, at least it'll remove the chance that it's a framebuffer issue
2007-12-28T10:25:00.000Z	alexandroid	nickrud	will try that, thank you!
