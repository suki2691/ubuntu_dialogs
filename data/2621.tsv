2012-07-28T22:47:00.000Z	r0tha	livingdaylight	well i mean if you feel that annoyed by it
2012-07-28T22:49:00.000Z	livingdaylight	r0tha	i didn't mean to imply that I am annoyed by it. Sorry, if that is how it translates over the net. I just meant to ask how, and at what point do I remove the usb? Should I try and time it as it reboots and just pull it out? That feels violent and I don't want to get it wrong
