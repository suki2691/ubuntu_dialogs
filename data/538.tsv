2012-11-05T19:40:00.000Z	net_runner007	moondoggy	I'm running it on a fujitsu laptop. i don't think it's the monitor tho becuz the 'screen and lock' under 'system settings' is what is allways reset to the brightest level
2012-11-05T19:42:00.000Z	moondoggy	net_runner007	is this when you wake up the monitor, or do a reboot?
2012-11-05T19:45:00.000Z	moondoggy	net_runner007	Hmmm... I don't know where those settings are, then.  When you log in, does it go to your chosen brightness?
