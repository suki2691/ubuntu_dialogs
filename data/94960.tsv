2009-03-10T16:43:00.000Z	alphakamp		I got the tzdate update yesterday, it corrected DST, but today the time is off by an hr and a half (ubuntu server 8.04) anyone else exp this?
2009-03-10T16:45:00.000Z	Pici	alphakamp	I believe  so

2009-03-10T16:45:00.000Z	alphakamp	Pici	dpk-reconfigure tzdata? should do it?
