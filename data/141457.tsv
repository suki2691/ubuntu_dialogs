2007-09-18T16:51:00.000Z	z9999		I have build-essential 11.1 installed, but /lib/modules/2.6.15-29-386 lacks a build directory, while /lib/modules/2.6.16-28-386 has one. Can I copy it to the latest kernel directory and then be able to run a 'sudo make' command for ndiswrapper?

2007-09-18T05:26:00.000Z	z9999	SlimeyPete	I realize many wish to help, but have encountered help that has worsened the problem several times and the helper then disappeared. I appreciate the effort, but have no idea when the advice is good or just trying to help.
