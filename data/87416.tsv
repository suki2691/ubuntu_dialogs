2008-06-18T18:41:00.000Z	Daworm		what's the best and lightest package to install for a webserver with sql ?
2008-06-18T18:42:00.000Z	Daworm		just standard apache and mysql 5? with php added?
2008-06-18T18:44:00.000Z	Vlet_	Daworm	that's the combination for which you will probably find the most documentation and examples, so I'd suggest going with that
2008-06-18T18:44:00.000Z	Daworm	Vlet_	understood. Not going to do any major customisation. Just have something running locally so I can do some quick tests before throwing it up on my host is all.
