2010-06-21T22:17:00.000Z	trism	SlidingHorn	removing evolution will only remove evolution evolution-couchdb evolution-exchange evolution-indicator evolution-plugins;
2010-06-21T22:18:00.000Z	SlidingHorn	trism	has that changed within the past couple releases?  I thought sure I remembered removing it (this was a long time ago, but...) and it took out a LOT of dependencies that really doomed my system for a while
