2008-11-03T00:44:00.000Z	Minty95		in wine how do you go about installing a game that wants DX, and when I try installing dx it gives me an error
2008-11-03T00:45:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Minty95	the games shouldn't actually need directx, I don't think.
2008-11-03T00:46:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Minty95	I believe Wine uses its own implementation of directx, which is installed by default. In case I'm wrong, ask in #winehq
2008-11-03T00:46:00.000Z	Minty95	RyanPrior	will do as I dont have a choice but say yes to install it ..., thanks
