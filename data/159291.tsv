2006-11-26T09:22:00.000Z	Falstius		how can I recover some files I just deleted from an ext3 filesystem?  (it isn't critical, but I'd like to get them back)

2006-11-26T09:25:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	Falstius	You might get lucky if you can find the inode you might beable to recover it
2006-11-26T09:27:00.000Z	Falstius	H3g3m0n	yeah, I figured as much.  Its not worth that kind of time.  Thanks.
