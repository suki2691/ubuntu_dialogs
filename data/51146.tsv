Does he need write access to EVERY FOLDER on the path, including /usr and /usr/local, etc?

2010-07-23T08:34:00.000Z	froek	mib_mib	he only needs --x to get into them
2010-07-23T08:35:00.000Z	mib_mib	froek	can you help then? I have created a group called 'mygroup', and added a user 'myuser' to it. I have recursively changed group permissions all the way down that stack (chmod -R 775 /usr/local/myfolder), and chgrp -R mygroup /usr/local/myfolder) but it still isn't working
