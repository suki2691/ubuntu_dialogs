2006-04-07T07:38:00.000Z	LocoLappy	rambo3	the reason I ask is that I have this sh script and it is supposed to dl a package to ${base-dir}${packagename-dir} but the url failed, I want to put the file into that place and then continue the script
2006-04-07T07:42:00.000Z	LocoLappy	rambo3	so if I were running the sh script in '/opt' then ${base-dir}${packagename-dir} would be here -->  /packagename-dir/   ... is this right?
