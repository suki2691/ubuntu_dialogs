2010-05-08T22:52:00.000Z	romeus		after a failed upgrade, I did a fresh install of Lucid on my T60 (ATI Radeon X1400 - R300). Even though the LiveCD booted and installed fine, the first boot after installation froze with a screen corruption. It now only boots to the command line and recovery mode, resetting X defaults, and failsafeX have not helped.

2010-05-08T22:54:00.000Z	romeus	kjele_	pretty sure it wasn't the CD, as I used the LiveCD extensively
