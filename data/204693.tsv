2005-12-12T16:23:00.000Z	rowanjl		I'm trying to build an apache2 module, but I have no idea what to point --with-apache-dir=* at, anyone know?
2005-12-12T16:23:00.000Z	frogz00	rowanjl	dunno, /var/www ?
2005-12-12T16:52:00.000Z	frogz00	rowanjl	have you tried just ./configure without setting --with-apache ?
2005-12-12T16:53:00.000Z	rowanjl	frogz00	yeah, that works now that I've managed to install the correct packages :P
