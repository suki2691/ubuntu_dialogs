2011-05-14T23:06:00.000Z	oCean	edgy	try sudo start ufw
2011-05-14T23:08:00.000Z	edgy	LjL	restart ufw didn't help but sudo iptables-restore hangs without giving me the prompt back
2011-05-14T23:09:00.000Z	edgy	LjL	by default does ubuntu have iptables rules or not?
2011-05-14T23:09:00.000Z	oCean	edgy	see /etc/ufw
