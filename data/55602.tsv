2010-01-20T10:20:00.000Z	katyl	semitones	It's unstable, there is a chance that two processes could try to manipulate the same data at the same time and cause instability.
2010-01-20T10:21:00.000Z	semitones	katyl	hmm, ok. Why is it used in Ubuntu Studio then?
2010-01-20T10:22:00.000Z	semitones	katyl	Flannel: it was something about low latency that I don't understand
