2009-02-26T08:15:00.000Z	Flynsarmy		Would i notice any speed improvement switching to 64-bit intrepid? Are there any major caveats?
2009-02-26T08:15:00.000Z	rww	Flynsarmy	probably not, and not really. Intrepid 64-bit has fixed most of the flash/driver/etc. problems.
2009-02-26T08:17:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	rww	what're the advantages of the 64-bit version if not speed?
