2010-09-05T19:08:00.000Z	rautamiekka	n00by	I think it means GNU C Compiler.
2010-09-05T19:10:00.000Z	rautamiekka	n00by	from Wikipedia: Front end and back end are generalized terms that refer to  the initial and the end stages of a process. The front end is  responsible for collecting input in various forms from the user and  processing it to conform to a specification the back end can use. The  front end is an interface between the user and the back end.
