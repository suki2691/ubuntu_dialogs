2007-10-30T00:13:00.000Z	LiMaO	maru	you just gotta read it. install package dbus-glib-1
2007-10-30T00:13:00.000Z	LiMaO	maru	and don't you ever try 'make' or 'make install' if you had errors in the configure process
2007-10-30T00:13:00.000Z	LiMaO	maru	also, why are you compiling something from source?
