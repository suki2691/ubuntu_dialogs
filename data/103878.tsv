2011-06-24T20:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shishir	install ubuntu-restricted-extras and w32codecs (will need medibuntu repo enabling)
2011-06-24T20:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shishir	you'll find ubuntu restricted extras in software centre
2011-06-24T20:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shishir	you don't need commands
